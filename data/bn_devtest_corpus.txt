Abstract
Gene interactions in cells can be represented by gene regulatory networks. A Boolean net-
work models gene interactions according to rules where gene expression is represented by
binary values ( on / off or {1, 0}). In reality, however, the gene ’s state can have multiple val-
ues due to biological properties. Furthermore, the noisy nature of the experimental designresults in uncertainty about a state of the gene. Here we present a new Boolean networkparadigm to allow intermediate values on the interval [0, 1]. As in the Boolean network, fixedpoints or attractors of such a model correspond to biological phenotypes or states. We useour new extension of the Boolean network paradigm to model gene expression in first andsecond heart field lineages which are cardiac progenitor cell populations involved in earlyvertebrate heart development. By this we are able to predict additional biological pheno-types that the Boolean model alone is not able to identify without utilizing additional biologi-cal knowledge. The additional phenotypes predicted by the model were confirmed bypublished biological experiments. Furthermore, the new method predicts gene expressionpropensities for modelled but yet to be analyzed genes.
Introduction
Specialization of cells during development and differentiation is driven by transcription or
growth factors. These are interconnected in gene regulatory networks. The temporary regu-lated interaction of these factors are finally resulting in terminally differentiated, specialized
cells which are characterized by the expression of a certain set of genes. Thus, development and
function of a certain cell type is largely reflected by the expression of selected genes in a cell.Gene regulatory networks describe the interactions between those genes in the cell [ 1–3].
During embryonic development, these gene regulatory networks evolve over time towards a
stable state, finally reflecting the terminally differentiated cell [ 1], i.e., biological phenotypes.

A gene regulatory network can be visualized as a static map that describes the interaction of
these genes and reflects the activation or inactivation of genes by other factors in the network.
Such a gene regulatory network can be implemented as a Boolean network if one assumes thata gene can be either active or inactive in a cell and thus can be represented by a Boolean value(on/offor {1,0}). Interaction between genes can then be mathematically modeled by Boolean
functions. A set of such logical rules or functions, more exactly one Boolean function per con-
sidered gene defines a Boolean network (BN) [ 4,5]. Given some initial expression pattern, a
BN computes the evolution of gene expression in discrete time steps. Of particular importance
are states which are invariant or lead to periodic sequences of expression patterns, so called
attractors. For finite sized BNs any initial state will converge to one of these attractors in finitetime [ 6] In a Boolean network representing a gene regulatory network, these attractors are the
equivalent to the stable state of gene expression reflecting the differentiated biological pheno-
type of the cell.
BNs are useful as a first approach when it comes to model complex networks with many
genes and their interactions [ 7]. Often the BN is modeled from known regulatory interactions
that are manually derived from qualitative wet-lab experiments [ 8] or computationally deter-
mined with BN reconstruction methods [ 9,10]. Additionally, simulated Boolean states of
genes from the simulation allow an intuitive interpretation of the results. Recently, BN models
have been used to capture the essence of gene regulation in several biological processes such as
the mammalian cell cycle [ 11], the guard cell abscisic acid signaling [ 12], or the oxidative stress
response pathway [ 13].
Modelling of gene regulatory networks and their simulation, however, is hampered by dif-
ferent drawbacks. In practice, for example, absolute data for gene expression activities are mea-sured indirectly, e.g., by quantifying the relative amounts of the corresponding transcripts.
These measurements are inherently noisy. Furthermore, some notion of activity/inactivity has
to be inferred in order to infer the state of the gene. To this effect binarization schemes are usedin order to differentiate between active and inactive genes in time series data [ 14]. Here, one
also has to consider that effective thresholds are gene dependent [ 8]. Finally, one has to take
into account that gene expression can vary between different cells of an apparently homoge-
neous population of cells as previously shown for the common cardiac progenitor cell popula-tion that gives rise to the heart [ 15].
Here, we implement a novel extension of the Boolean network paradigm and illustrate the
procedure on a Heart Field Development model. We also illustrate the utility of the method onthe Mammalian Cell Cycle [ 11] (see Section G in S1 Supplementary Information File ). Our pri-
mary focus is the evolutionary conserved core cardiac regulatory network that drives early car-
diac development and that predicts the dynamic behaviour of gene expression during earlydevelopment [ 16]. In this process a common cardiac progenitor cell population splits into two
populations of cells called first (FHF) and second heart field (SHF), that are characterized by
the selective expression of typical transcription factors such as Isl1, Tbx1, Tbx5, and Nkx2.5.Cells of the FHF develop to the primary heart tube and later to the left ventricle and the atria,whereas cells of the SHF mainly develop into the right ventricle and the outflow tract [ 17].
Activation of these genes during cardiac development is regulated among others through
growth factors of the Wnt family [ 18]. The BN model of this gene regulatory network correctly
predicts the general pattern of gene expression in general, work in Xenopus [ 19] and in mouse
ES cells [ 15] albeit suggests that during cardiac development on a single cell level a much more
complex variability in gene expression exists.
In an attempt to include the variability of single cell gene expression in an otherwise homog-
enous cell population, our goal was to describe gene expression levels with multiple values,
extending the binary values of a BN. Previously, transformations of BNs have also been

considered by others [ 20,21]. An overview over these approaches can be found in [ 22,23].
These transform the Boolean rules into a system of ordinary differential equations which
describe the dynamics of gene concentrations. As opposed to the analysis of behaviour andevolution of concentration levels we use an approach to model continuous intervals of geneexpression values in order to potentially find new fixed points using only the original BN. In
our model, we call continuous values attributed to genes “propensities ”of gene expression and
do not need additional parameters that are otherwise required for modelling concentrations.The corresponding interactions are derived from the Boolean functions of the BN. The opera-
tions AND, OR, and NOT are replaced by their arithmetic counterparts based on fuzzy logic
product sum rules [ 24]. This extends the BN into a discrete-time, non-linear, dynamical model
that is represented by a system of difference equations, namely, a BN extension (BNE). Natu-
rally, fixed points of this new model also represent possible expression patterns or phenotypes
of cells. Interestingly, this novel method is able to predict variabilities in gene expression duringcardiac development and cell cycle (see Figs M and N in S1 Supplementary Information File ).
For cardiac development the extension predicts additional phenotypes that are in agreement
with published results and novel gene expression pattern for yet to be analyzed genes.
Methods
Since we intertwine biological and mathematical terms we shortly present an overview of theimportant terminology that we use in the following:
Boolean fixed point: A fixed point of the BN. It takes values B
n2{0,1}nwith nbeing the
number of variables in the BN.
BNE fixed point: A fixed point of the BNE. It takes values In2[0, 1]n.
biological phenotype: A phenotype that describes a binarized gene expression of measure-
ments. It takes values in Bn, i.e., in form of binary gene expression.
hypothetical phenotype: A pattern of gene expression. Hypothetical phenotypes are used in
order to map the extension fixed points to their nearest neighbouring pattern. In our particu-
lar case we consider binary gene expression patterns with values in Bn(a set of 2nbinary
patterns).
The extension and analysis of the BN is conducted in several steps drafted in Fig 1 and are
described in detail below. Given a BN, using the canonical Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF),
each term is then transformed into a sum of products. The extended model is then simulated
to find BNE fixed points of the model. These fixed points can be interpreted by a mapping thefixed points to the nearest hypothetical phenotypes. The meaning of the nearest hypothetical
phenotype must then be further interpreted in biological context.
Boolean Networks (BN)
BN were pioneered by Kauffman in 1969 [ 25,26] to model gene interactions in a cell. BNs are
based on the assumption that a cell regulates its function in a time-dependent manner byswitching genes on (active) or off (inactive). The regulatory mechanism is described by logicalrules where the state of a gene is defined by logic rules based on the previous gene states.
Here, we denote by B= {0, 1} the set of Boolean values in binary representation. Formally, a
BN is defined by nBoolean variables x=(x
1,...,xn)2Bnand a vector of nBoolean transition
functions F=(f1,...,fn), which describe the interaction between variables.
A transition function fiis a map fi:Bn!B. In that way that the discrete time evolution gen-
erated by a BN is defined by sequential application of the vector valued function F=(f1,...,fn)

Fig 1. Phenotype analysis using the Boolean Network Extension (BNE). The application of the BNE to a
given Boolean network (BN) can be divided into three basic steps: Model extension (top), identification of
stable structures (middle) and mapping to phenotypes (bottom). In the model extension step (top) the rules of
the BN are transformed to the rules of the BNE by converting the rules of the BN to canonical disjunctive
normal form (DNF) and then to product-sum fuzzy logic (DNF product-sum extension, details see sectionExtension of Boolean networks). In the “identification of stable structures ”-step (middle) the extended BNE is
simulated for a large number of random inputs. The resulting approximated attractors can either be fixed
points approximated by point clouds, fixed points depending on one or multiple parameters or different
dependencies. Finally, new phenotypes are identified step (bottom) by mapping the fixed points to their
nearest hypothetical phenotype.

priori allowed as BN initial value. It follows that evolution of an initial state will converge to a
cyclic sequence of states in ﬁnite time. Such sequences are called attractors. Attractors are usu-
ally categorized in
fixed points (attractors of period 1) and
periodic sequences (attractors of period T>1).
In the following synchronous BN will be considered. In synchronous BN, each Boolean func-
tion is executed once at each time step.
In a Boolean network any variable may interact with any subset of variables in the network.
Additionally, variables with constant values may be considered in order to parametrize external
inputs, e.g., influences of exogenous factors. Discrete time delays may also be modeled by intro-
ducing a chain of “dummy ”variables which consecutively take the value of the chain ’s first var-
iable value. Such a chain of nadditional “dummy ”variables result in a time delay of nsteps of
the considered variable.
Boolean Network Extension (BNE)
ByIwe denote the interval [0, 1]. The new model extends the state space from BntoIn.W ed o
so by adapting the logical rules of the original BN. In general one has to find a mapping from
the Boolean operators AND ( ^), OR ( _), and NOT (¬) to continuous operators (functions) on
In. For the sake of consistency, these operators should render the same results as their corre-
sponding Boolean analogue when restricting the values to {0, 1}.
A common approach is to treat the Boolean transition functions as fuzzy logic functions
[24,27]. In the fuzzy logic literature, there are mainly two approaches. The first approach is the
min –max fuzzy logic. The second approach, product –sum fuzzy logic, replaces the Boolean
algebraic operators on Bn(_,^,¬) with their arithmetic counterparts on In, namely, (+, ×) and
negation by (1 −x). Constant values of the BN are translated to constant functions of the BNE
fromI. Contrarily to the min –max fuzzy logic, the product –sum fuzzy logic are differentiable
functions. Additionally, product –sum allows a smooth evolution and interaction between the
variables which correspond the idea that interactions in cells depend on the concentration lev-els of products. In contrary, in min –max variables that are not minimal or maximal do not
influence the resulting value. In the following, we will only consider the product –sum fuzzy
logic.

Eq 8 can be derived from Eqs 6and7using DeMorgan ’s law. The Boolean formulae are trans-
formed into a unique representation using the canonical disjunctive normal form (DNF)which can be directly derived from the truth table. Then, given a Boolean formula in DNF, we
directly extend it into the continuous version by applying the product-sum rules. The resulting
formula have values in Isince DNF encodes a truth table for every possible term with nvari-
ables [ 28]. It is easily veri ﬁed that the BN and its extension coincide for variable values in B
n
when applying the DNF/product –sum extension (DNFPS).

Extension fixed points
As in the case of BN, its extension will have fixed points. Fixed points of the model are meant
to represent biological states since both are stable and time-invariant. Firstly, we defined theextension procedure in such a way that a BN and its extension are consistent when restricting
to values in B
n. Hence, the BN fixed points are fixed points of its extension as well. Secondly,
an extension may have non –Boolean fixed points.
One crucial point of the extension is the fact that the variables of the system, i.e., variables
which are considered as constant input, may now take values in I. If these parameters are
uncertain, unknown, or the behavior of the system is to be examined, one would have to inves-tigate the variations of the fixed points as the input variables are changed. Compared to the BNcase, two new aspects need to be taken into account. It is a priori not possible to predict the
number of fixed points of a BNE nor is it possible to conduct an exhaustive search. Addition-
ally, the iteration of a BNE can only be (practically) carried out numerically. Thus the values ofthe fixed points given by iteration are not exact. The same would be true if the fixed points
were found by numerically solving ^f^xðÞ ¼ ^x. Any attempt to systematically ﬁnd the set of
extension ﬁxed points of an extension would hence result in a numerical approximation of
ﬁxed points gained by sweeping the initial values of the respective search through I
n. Amongst
those found, several may correspond to a single actual ﬁxed point. A proper identi ﬁcation of
the true ﬁxed point is therefore necessary. They can, e.g., be grouped into ﬁxed point proto-
types by using k-means. The ﬁxed points of the BNE would typically describe surfaces over the
investigated parameter space (see Fig 2 ).
Numerical considerations
BN were simulated with the help of the BoolNet package [ 29]. Fixed points were investigated in
two manners

gence was achieved after 20 –30 function evaluations.

which is a the trust region method using a double dogleg method [ 32].

Association of BNE fixed points with putative biological phenotypes
Whether considering prototypes or actual fixed points of the extension, the actual predictive
value of the model is given by its capacity to describe and predict biological phenotypes. As
mentioned above, we expect our model to reflect the properties of a Boolean state under pertur-bation. It would hence be expected that only stable fixed points may be of interest biologically
since stable states correspond to biological states in equilibrium. Also, in simulations, unstable
fixed points are unlikely to be found numerically. However, known Boolean fixed points mayturn out to be unstable under the extension. Thus the BNE is able to additionally characterize
the stability of the Boolean fixed points. Conversely, new stable fixed points may be found by
the BNE.
The values of the fixed points do require a scheme to determine expression levels of each
specific gene to enable comparison with measured binary biological phenotypes. In practice
this would mean that we would need a binarization scheme to extract the gene expression in
terms of a set of a priori unknown critical values. For this reason we employ a more absolutescheme for the identification by mapping fixed points and hypothetical phenotypes which lie
nearest to each other in I
n, in a subset of SI/C26In, or a fuzzy description of hypothetical pheno-
types in {0, 1}n. We call this identification nearest neighbor matching (NNM). In general, using
a distance measure results in a specific ordering of the considered elements. Typically we use
the Euclidean distance since it is widely known and has an intuitive interpretation. In order to
assess the mapping approach we also applied it in context of the cell cycle network [ 11] (see
Section G in S1 Supplementary Information File ).
Interpretation of the values of a BNE
The BNE uses fuzzy logic product-sum transformation of the Boolean rules to compute a value
for each variable. The main property of the extension is that it inherits the interaction patterns
of the BN . The defined operations corresponding to the Boolean operations are also t–norms
and corresponding associated co-norms, which ensure that the formalism is a consistent fuzzy
logic [ 34,35]. Furthermore, the extension is conducted in such a way that the transition of the
DNFPS to the Boolean limit is differentiable.
We wish to emphasize that the assumption we make is that the approximation also yields
plausible results for larger perturbations over the entire Inand that the intermediate values will
be in a monotonic relation to measurements of gene expression, i.e, the larger the value xithe
larger the expression of the corresponding gene product.
The assertions of the BNE values are in no way absolute but do reflect the corresponding
expression of genes in a relational way, i.e., place the corresponding expressions on an ordinalscale. We can state, a gene has a “higher ”or“lower ”expression values when comparing two
values. This however does not give any conclusive answer to whether a gene is expressed or
not. The values only reveal an ordering of gene expressions. From the Boolean case we expectthat 0 corresponds to certainly unexpressed and 1 to certainly expressed. An actual quantifica-
tion for values in between 0 and 1 may hence only be carried with some a priori knowledge,
i.e., by comparison with actual measurements.
As the BNE attributes numbers to genes, it might also be natural to interpret those as con-
centrations. An example would be to associate the outputs of the BNE as the gene transcript
products over time. However, it is very unlikely that, what in effect is a system of kinetic reac-
tions may be described without the addition of any kinetic parameters. Such attempts havebeen carried out in the past and do require additional parameters to describe the dynamics of
the underlying chemical molecules [ 20,21]. Since the values are neither concentrations nor
probabilities we call them propensities for gene expression.

Results
Previous results for early cardiac development
Herrmann et al. [ 16] analyzed the gene regulatory network of early cardiac development by use
of a BN and found a correspondence between biological measurements and mathematically
simulated attractors. The model simulates the interaction between intracellular genes (Bmp2,
canonical Wnt, Dkk1, Fgf8, Foxc1.2, GATAs, Mesp1, Isl1, Nkx2.5, Tbx1, Tbx5) and extracellu-lar factors (exogenous Bmp2 and canonical Wnt) that form gradients ( Table 2 ).
When considering all possible binary initial values, two fixed points were reached in 99% of
the cases. The gene expression values corresponding to these two fixed points are similar to the
gene expression in the FHF and SHF that was extracted from literature. In 49% of the initialvalues, the network converges to attractors corresponding to the FHF (49% of cases) and in
50% to the SHF. In the remaining 1% the simulation converged towards a fixed point with no
activated cardiac genes. This was thought to correspond to a biological phenotype where noheart field is formed, like if canonical Wnt signaling is not activated during development. The
BN fixed point that resembles the FHF is characterized by the expression of the FHF specific
genes Bmp2, GATAs, Nkx2.5, and Tbx5 to be active. Accordingly, the fixed point for the SHFshows activation of the SHF genes, Isl1, Foxc1/2, Tbx1 and Fgf8. In the following we name thephenotypes predicted by the Boolean model FHF_BOOL andSHF_BOOL , respectively. We
apply the BNE to this cardiac development model in order to investigate new phenotypes that
are outside of the Boolean pradigm.
Biological phenotypes are described in terms of present or absent gene expression. In our
case we wanted to compare the gene expression of the four genes Isl1, Nkx2.5, Tbx1, and Tbx5
for FHF and SHF differentiation to the single cell RT-PCR analysis of Gessert and Kühl [ 19].
The phenotypes previously identified are given in Fig 3 . In the following we name these pheno-
types as SHF1, SHF2, SHF3 and SHF4, as these are determined as second heart field

the first heart field FHF5, FHF6, FHF7.
Simulation results for the BNE
Given the continuous model of early cardiac development we computed fixed points for 104
different initial values of the genes. The values for each gene were drawn from a uniform distri-
bution U(0,1). We additionally performed simulations that were aimed at initial inactivation
(value 0) of all genes with the exogen _canWnt _Ias controlling parameter in order to examine
its influence to the formation of the phenotypes. As the cardiac model is parametrized by the
exogen _canWnt _Iparameter, we ordered the identified fixed points accordingly. The linear
increase of the propensity of the exogen _canWnt _Icauses a continuous transition in propen-
sity for the remaining genes (see Fig B in S1 Supplementary Information File ).
Prediction of additional phenotypes for FHF and SHF
The structure provided by the BN is sufficient enough to allow a prediction of previously
unknown biological phenotypes through the extension.
In order to characterize the phenotypes in the BNE we compared all 11 genes that are effec-
tively modeled by the BN (Bmp2, canonical Wnt, Dkk1, Fgf8, Foxc1.2, GATAs, Mesp1, Isl1,
Nkx2.5, Tbx1, Tbx5). This allows prediction of gene expression propensity of genes for which
no expression information is available. In order to evaluate our results we computed the dis-tances between all hypothetical phenotypes and the continuous fixed points for each parameter
value of exogen _canWnt _Iin the simulation. The 11 genes give rise to 2
11= 2048 different
qualitative expression patterns that are compared and the phenotype with the minimal distance

guish the hypothetical phenotypes we use the naming scheme “PH-X ”where X is the decimal
number encoding the binary expression pattern of the corresponding phenotype.

also correspond to the fixed points of the BN model FHF_BOOL andSHF_BOOL , respectively.
TheNO_CARDIAC fixed point of the BNE also corresponds to the “no-cardiac ”fixed point of
the BN. For the remaining phenotypes BNE predicts expression pattern for the FHF7 via PH-
1060 and additionally three new phenotypes. These phenotypes, PH-1076 ,PH-564 , and PH-
692, correspond to the SHF1 based on the four genes measured by RT-PCR [ 19], however, the
data shows that the SHF1 phenotype may have different gene expression propensities for the
genes Bmp2, canonical Wnt, and Fgf8 ( Fig 4 ).
Stability of fixed points of the BN
The Boolean phenotypes predicted by the BN model correspond to the FHF6 and SHF4 pheno-
types (Figs 3and4). In the BNE these phenotypes correspond to values close to 0 and 1 of the
exogen _canWnt _Iexpression propensity. Consistently, our extension can predict the same
phenotypes of the BN model and it shows that under the perturbation of exogen _canWnt _I

parameter the results remain close to the phenotypes found by the BN model. The 1% attractor,
which was assumed not to correspond to any of the heart fields, is also a fixed point of the
BNE. In our simulation we additionally analyzed the BN fixed points for stability. In particular,the 1% attractor reported in the Boolean Network model. Any perturbations added to thisfixed point resulted in the fixed point corresponding to FHF4 for the given value of exogen _-
canWnt _I. This fixed point is thus unstable in the BNE.
Discussion
We extended the Boolean network model of early cardiac development and identified the bio-
logical phenotypes that were previously predicted by the Boolean model as well as additional
biological phenotypes that represent a more detailed differentiation of the FHF and SHF in
terms of gene expression propensities. These additional phenotypes were confirmed by experi-ments in Xenopus laevis [19].
There are several advantages of the proposed method. Essentially, it helps to characterize
the gene expression propensity of phenotypes from the structure given by the BN alone. It cor-responds to the BN model in case of binary inputs. The complexity of the extension can be
seen as an intermediate representation between the BN and ODE models. It can cope with con-
tinuous values but does not need additional kinematic parameters that are required, e.g., in anODE model for concentration levels. Considering the possibility theory approach [ 36], the
BNE does not use fuzzy sets and thus is not representable as a possibility. In our case, the fuzzy
logic approach is used to extend the Boolean function on the intervals [0, 1].
Different approaches exist that transform a BN into a system of ordinary differential equa-
tions. Mendoza and Xenarios [ 21] partition the genes into activating and inhibiting subsets.
Each subset is postulated to activate or inactivate a considered gene in a sigmoid manner add-
ing the corresponding terms to the ODE vector field. They do not directly transform the logicalrules of the BN, but rather construct the rules according to the activator and inhibitor subsets.
They identify fixed points in the system by perturbing the Boolean attractors. By focusing on
activation and inhibition of the genes they limit the BN to only a subset of possible Booleanrules for state transition. Conversely, the approach of Wittmann et al. [ 20] directly transforms
the rules of a BN into continuous functions. They include production and decay rates into the
rules, thereby introducing additional parameters into the model. Transformation of the contin-
uous input variables to continuous switch-like values is done with Hill functions [ 37–39]. Both
approaches have in common that they require additional knowledge either from biological
experiments or expert opinion to determine the values for the different parameters.
The state space of BN is discrete and finite. The attractors can be exactly determined by sim-
ulating the network in an exhaustive manner. In this respect, the BNE has the same limitation
as an ODE model. In general, the complete exploration of the search space for identification of
fixed points is infeasible and we cannot determine the number of fixed points in the system apriori. Fixed points of the model can only be found numerically by sweeping through the
search space.
The BNE behaviour resembles that of the Boolean model for small perturbations in the
Boolean input. When the Boolean input is perturbed and the functions are evaluated for a sin-gle step, the resulting values of the BNE deviate slightly from the values of the successor state of
the corresponding BN. The BNE functions reflect the Boolean rules of the Boolean Network
which regulate the expression of genes. The BNE models the influence of genes on other genesin a continuous manner. The resulting values of BNE can be seen as propensity for gene
expression. As genes interact with each other via the concentration of gene products, a propen-
sity is similar to concentration levels.

Similarly to the fixed points of the BN, we relate the resulting fixed points to biological phe-
notypes. We use a distance based approach to map fixed points to phenotypes. In order to
compare the fixed points we compute Euclidean distances to the biological phenotypes. Thehypothetical phenotype which has the shortest distance to a fixed point corresponds to the phe-notype of the fixed point. In case of perfect agreement between the fixed point and the pheno-
type the distance is 0. In order to find the best corresponding phenotype to a fixed point it is
necessary to exhaustively test the set of all hypothetical phenotypes.
Since the values of genes of the fixed points represent only gene expression propensities,
one could choose a threshold for which a certain gene propensity becomes either an activation
or inactivation of a gene. However, this requires additional knowledge about the property ofthe gene. Usually, the threshold is not easily determined and the choice may be arbitrary. We
avoid choosing a threshold by using the proposed distance based approach.
The fixed points of the BNE for the cardiac development are parametrized by the exogen _-
canWnt _Iparameter. This parameter influences all core genes of the model except for exogenous
Bmp2 parameters. This means that the fixed points of the cardiac model are not just single points,
but the values of the fixed point are continuous curves that depend directly on the gene expres-sion propensity of the exogenous canonical Wnt. Further, the cardiac model directly encodes theexogen _Bmp2_Ias a constant in the model. If we allow interval values for the exogen _Bmp2_I,i t
would directly influence the interaction of the core genes. This would result in fixed points that
depend on two independent parameters and form a plane of fixed points. Here, however, wewant to remain faithful to the original Boolean model for cardiac development where the exo-
gen_Bmp2_Iparameter is needed to be “on”in order to start the FHF and SHF formation [ 40].
The additional phenotypes, that are described by the fixed points of the BNE, are not found
in the BN due to its discrete nature. However, these phenotypes are found to be biologically rel-
evant to the early cardiac development. In general, the examination of BN attractors in pertur-
bative manner with the BNE makes it possible to further characterize any Boolean model. Theattractors of the cardiac development BN model are per definition fixed points in the BNE. Incase of the 1% attractor from the Boolean Model, we found that this fixed point is unstable.
Any perturbation of this fixed point leads to the FHF phenotype of the BN.
In our approach we use the nearest neighbor method to map fixed points to phenotypes.
We do so by only considering a subset of genes that are know from the literature. However,
once we have mapped the phenotypes, we can explore genes for which no information is avail-
able. The gene expression propensity of the additional genes is given by the fixed points of thesimulated model. We thus can predict what a phenotype would look like by inspecting the
complete set of genes for the nearest hypothetical phenotype as has been shown in the simula-
tion of the BNE for the 11 core genes for early cardiac development.

Abstract
Cytokines such as TNF and FASL can trigger death or survival depending on cell lines and cellular conditions. The
mechanistic details of how a cell chooses among these cell fates are still unclear. The understanding of these processes isimportant since they are altered in many diseases, including cancer and AIDS. Using a discrete modelling formalism, wepresent a mathematical model of cell fate decision recapitulating and integrating the most consistent facts extracted from
the literature. This model provides a generic high-level view of the interplays between NF kB pro-survival pathway, RIP1-
dependent necrosis, and the apoptosis pathway in response to death receptor-mediated signals. Wild type simulationsdemonstrate robust segregation of cellular responses to receptor engagement. Model simulations recapitulate documentedphenotypes of protein knockdowns and enable the prediction of the effects of novel knockdowns. In silico experiments
simulate the outcomes following ligand removal at different stages, and suggest experimental approaches to further
validate and specialise the model for particular cell types. We also propose a reduced conceptual model implementing thelogic of the decision process. This analysis gives specific predictions regarding cross-talks between the three pathways, as
well as the transient role of RIP1 protein in necrosis, and confirms the phenotypes of novel perturbations. Our wild type and
mutant simulations provide novel insights to restore apoptosis in defective cells. The model analysis expands ourunderstanding of how cell fate decision is made. Moreover, our current model can be used to assess contradictory orcontroversial data from the literature. Ultimately, it constitutes a valuable reasoning tool to delineate novel experiments.

Introduction
Engagement of TNF or FAS receptors can trigger cell death by
apoptosis or necrosis, or yet lead to the activation of pro-survival
signalling pathway(s), such as NF kB. Apoptosis represents a tightly
controlled mechanism of cell death that is triggered by internal orexternal death signals or stresses. This mechanism involves asequence of biochemical and morphological changes resulting in
the vacuolisation of cellular content, followed by its phagocyte-
mediated elimination. This physiological process regulates cellhomeostasis, development, and clearance of damaged, virus-infected or cancer cells. In contrast, pathological necrosis results in
plasma membrane disruption and release of intracellular content
that can trigger inflammation in the neighbouring tissues. Longseen as an accidental cell death, necrosis also appears regulatedand possibly involved in the clearance of virus-infected or cancer
cells that escaped apoptosis [1].
Dynamical modelling of the regulatory network controlling
apoptosis, non-apoptotic cell death and survival pathways couldhelp identify how and under which conditions the cell chooses
between different types of cellular deaths or survival. Moreover,modelling could suggest ways to re-establish the apoptotic deathwhen it is altered, or yet to trigger necrosis in apoptosis-resistant
cells. The decision process involves several signalling pathways, as
well as multiple positive and negative regulatory circuits.Mathematical modelling provides a rigorous integrative approachto understand and analyse the dynamical behaviours of suchcomplex systems.
Published models of cell death control usually focus on one
death pathway only, such as the apoptotic extrinsic or intrinsic
pathways [2,3,4]. A few studies integrate both pathways [5], someshow that the concentration of specific components contribute tothe decision between death and survival [6,7] while other studiesinvestigate the balance between proliferation, survival or apoptosisin specific cell types along with the role of key components in thesepathways [8], but no mathematical models including necrosis areavailable yet. Moreover, we still lack models properly demonstrat-ing how cellular conditions determine the choice between necrosis,

apoptosis and survival, and how and to what extent conversions
are allowed between these fates.
Our study aims at identifying determinants of this cell fate
decision process. The three main phenotypes considered areapoptosis ,non-apoptotic cell death (which mainly covers necrosis ) and
survival . Although the pathways leading to these three phenotypes
are highly intertwined, we first describe them separately hereafter,concentrating on the players we chose to include in each pathway.Summarised in Figure 1A, this description does not intend to beexhaustive, but rather aims at covering the most establishedprocesses participating in cell fate decision.
Caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death
Only the apoptotic caspase-dependent pathway downstream of
FAS and TNF receptors is considered here. Upon engagement by
their ligands and in the presence of FADD (FAS-Associated
protein with Death Domain), a specific Death Inducible SignallingComplex (DISC-FAS or DISC-TNF in Figure 1) forms andrecruits pro-caspase-8. This leads to the cleavage and activation ofcaspase-8 (CASP8). In the so-called type II cells, CASP8 triggersthe intrinsic or mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, whichalso responds to DNA damage directly through the p53-mediated
chain of events (not detailed here). CASP8 cleaves the BH3-only
protein BID (not explicitly included in the diagram), which canthen translocate to the mitochondria outer membrane. There,BID competes with anti-apoptotic BH3 family members such asBCL2 for interaction with the proteins BAX or BAK (BAX willstand here for both BAX and BAK). Consequently, oligomerisa-tion of BAX results in mitochondrial outer membrane permea-bilisation (MOMP) and the release of pro-apoptotic factors. Once
released to the cytosol, cytochrome c (Cyt_c) interacts with
APAF1, recruiting pro-caspase-9. In presence of dATP, thisenables the assembly of the apoptosome complex (referred to as‘Apoptosome’ in Figure 1A, lumping APAF1 and pro-caspase-9),responsible for caspase-9 activation, followed by the proteolyticactivation of pro-caspase-3 (CASP3) [9]. By cleavage of specifictargets, the executioner caspases (CASP3 in the model) areresponsible for major biochemical and morphological changes
characteristic of apoptosis. SMAC/DIABLO (SMAC) is released
during MOMP to the cytosol, where it is able to inactivate the
caspase inhibitor XIAP [10]. CASP3 also participates in a positive
circuit by inducing the activation of CASP8 [11,12]. In type I cells,
CASP8 directly cleaves and activates executioner caspases such as
CASP3 (not described).
Non-apoptotic cell death (NonACD)
Here, we consider mainly a mode of cell death with
morphological features of necrosis, which occurs when apoptosis
is impeded in cells treated with cytokines [13] or in some specific
cell lines such as L929 cells when exposed to TNF [14]. In primary
T cells, if caspases are inhibited, activation of TNFR or FAS
causes necrosis via a pathway that requires the protein RIP1 and
its kinase activity (RIP1K) [13]. This RIP1-dependent cytokine-
induced necrotic death defines necroptosis [15,16]. A genetic
screen recently identified other genes necessary for this type of cell
death [17]. However, a precise description of this pathway is still
lacking. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were proposed to be
involved downstream of RIP1 [18]. ROS are also thought to play
a key role in the control of mitochondria permeability transition
(MPT), since they are produced by damaged mitochondria and
can oxidize mitochondrial components, thus favouring MPT
[19,20,21]. Furthermore, the role of mitochondria in necrosis is
highlighted through the involvement of MPT, which causes a fatal
drop in ATP level and leads to necrotic death. Indeed, MPT
results from the inhibition of ATP/ADP exchange at the level of
mitochondrial membranes, or from the inhibition of oxidative
phosphorylation decreasing cellular ATP level and causing energy
failure [21,22]. Although there is evidence that necrosis is alsotriggered by TNF- and FAS-independent pathways, these are not
yet considered in this study. These pathways include, for example,
calpain-mediated cleavage of AIF followed by its nuclear
translocation [23,24], or PARP-1-mediated NAD
+depletion
[24,25].
Survival pathway
NFkB represents a family of transcription factors that play a
central role in inflammation, immune response to infections and
cancer development [26]. The ubiquitination of RIP1 at lysine 63
by cIAP leads to the activation of IKK and ultimately that of
NFkB [27]. In different cell types, especially in tumour cell lines,
activation of NF kB inhibits TNF-induced cell death [28]. This
effect is mediated by NF kB target genes: cFLIP inhibits
recruitment of CASP8 by FADD [29]; anti-apoptotic BCL2
family members inhibit MOMP and MPT [30,31,32]; XIAP acts
as a caspase inhibitor [33]; and ferritin heavy chain [34] or
mitochondrial SOD2 [35] decrease ROS levels (these mechanisms
are represented in Figure 1A by a direct inhibitory arrow from
NFkB to ROS). For the sake of simplicity, other NF kB target
genes that are known to inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis are
provisionally omitted in the model (e.g., A20; cf. [36,37]).
Our goal here is to provide a simplified but yet rigorous model
of the mechanisms underlying cell fate selection in response to the
engagement of FAS and TNF receptors. We have proceeded in
several steps. First, we have assembled a regulatory network
covering the main experimental data. Species and interactions
were selected on the basis of an extensive literature search and
integrated in the form of a diagram or ‘‘regulatory graph’’. This
diagram is then translated into a dynamical model. Our analysisinitially focuses on the determination of the asymptotic properties
of the system for different conditions, which correspond to the
possible phenotypes that the model can account for. Next, weAuthor Summary
Activation of death receptors (TNFR and Fas) can trigger
either survival or cell death according to the cell type and
the cellular conditions. In other words, the same signal can
have antagonist responses. On one hand, the cell cansurvive by activating the NF kB signalling pathway. On the
other hand, it can die by apoptosis or necrosis. Apoptosis
is a suicide mechanism, i.e., an orchestrated way to disrupt
cellular components and pack them into specializedvesicles that can be easily removed from the environment,whereas necrosis is a type of death that involves release of
intracellular components in the surrounding tissues,
possibly causing inflammatory response and severe injury.We, biologists and theoreticians, have recapitulated and
integrated known biological data from the literature into
an influence diagram describing the molecular eventsleading to each possible outcome. The diagram has beentranslated into a dynamical Boolean model. Simulations of
wild type, mutant cells and drug treatments qualitatively
match current data, and predict several novel mutantphenotypes, along with general characteristics of the cellfate decision mechanism: transient activation of some key
proteins in necrosis, mutual inhibitory cross-talks between
the three pathways. Our model can further be used toassess contradictory data and address specific biologicalquestions through in silico experiments.Mathematical Model of Cell Fate Decision

Abstract
It has been suggested that irreducible sets of states in Probabilistic Boolean Networks correspond to cellular phenotype. In
this study, we identify such sets of states for each phase of the budding yeast cell cycle. We find that these ‘‘ergodic sets’’
underly the cyclin activity levels during each phase of the cell cycle. Our results compare to the observations made inseveral laboratory experiments as well as the results of differential equation models. Dynamical studies of this model: ( i)
indicate that under stochastic external signals the continuous oscillating waves of cyclin activity and the opposing waves of
CKIs emerge from the logic of a Boolean-based regulatory network without the need for specific biochemical/kinetic
parameters; ( ii) suggest that the yeast cell cycle network is robust to the varying behavior of cell size (e.g., cell division under
nitrogen deprived conditions); ( iii) suggest the irreversibility of the Start signal is a function of logic of the G1 regulon, and
changing the structure of the regulatory network can render start reversible.

Introduction
Complex network structures can be found across the biological
spectrum, and growing evidence indicates that these biochemicalnetworks have evolved to perform complex information processingtasks in order for the cells to appropriately respond to the oftennoisy and contradictory environmental cues [1]. While reduction-ist techniques focus on the local interactions of biologicalcomponents, the systems approach aims at studying properties ofbiological processes as a result of all components and their localinteractions working together [2].
A wide spectrum of modeling techniques ranging from
continuous frameworks utilizing differential equations to discrete(e.g., Boolean) techniques based on qualitative biological relation-ships exist [3–5]. Each modeling technique is based on differentassumptions and hence comes with different advantages anddisadvantages. Differential equation models can depict thedynamics of biological systems in great detail, but depend ona large number of difficult-to-obtain biological (kinetic) parame-ters. On the other hand, discrete modeling frameworks, namelyBoolean networks, are qualitative and parameter-free, whichmakes them more suitable to study the dynamics of large-scalesystems for which these parameters are not available. Further-more, probabilistic Boolean networks (PBN) enhance the discreteframework by allowing for uncertainty and stochasticity (e.g.,[6,7]).
It has been proposed that the irreducible sets of states (i.e.,
ergodic sets) of the corresponding Markov chain in probabilisticBoolean network models (PBNs) are the stochastic analogue of thelimit cycle in a standard Boolean network, and should thusrepresent cellular phenotype [8]. However, often PBNs with
perturbations are studied to include internal noise, rendering the
search for the irreducible sets trivial (as the whole state spaceconstitutes a single irreducible component). Furthermore, this
makes the determination of the limiting distribution of the
corresponding Markov chain and the interpretation of those
results in light of the biology challenging even for moderately sizedmodels [9–11].
Using the idea from [1] to introduce stochasticity to Boolean
models via control nodes, herein we determine and examine the
nature of ergodic sets of a regulatory network governing each
phase of the cell cycle of budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The
budding yeast cell cycle has been modeled previously using
Boolean approaches (e.g., [5,12,13]) and probabilistic Boolean
approaches (e.g., [7,14,15]). We expand on previous works by
considering each phase of the cell cycle as an individual evolving
system. The logic of the model used in this study was developed
from the description of the yeast cell cycle interactions given in
[12]. Using this model we show that as suggested in [8], irreducible
sets of states can correspond to cellular phenotype. This approachenables us to model and visualize richer dynamical properties of
each phase and the cell cycle as a whole. In particular, we show
that under stochastic external signals the continuous oscillating
waves of cyclin activity and the opposing waves of CKIs that form
the cell cycle engine can emerge from the logic of a relatively
simple regulatory network without the need for specific bio-
chemical/kinetic parameters. Furthermore, by considering each
phase of the cell cycle as an individual system represented by an
‘‘ergodic set’’, we are able to more directly and precisely compare
the model dynamics with experimental studies. Specifically, results
of [16] as interpreted graphically at cyclebase.org reveal relatively
precise similarities. We also observe good agreement between our
oscillating cyclin activities and recently published analyses of cyclin
activities using fluorescent microscopy in [17]. The improved
approach to the modeling of the yeast cell cycle enables us tovisualize other qualitative features of the system: the secondary

activation of a number of G1-cyclins later in the cell cycle [16] and
the renewed reversibility of Start upon the removal of the Cln2-
SBF-Whi5 feedback loop [18]. We also capture the samerobustness to internal perturbations as described in [5], howeverwe extend this result and conclude that each phase of the yeast cellcycle (and thus as the cell cycle as a whole) is robust in the face ofthe variable behavior of the cell size. Within the model, this resultsin the post-Start commitment to the cell cycle and the ability tocomplete a single round of division under deprived nutritionconditions [19].
Results
Modeling the Cell Cycle
The budding yeast cell cycle involves hundreds of species and
interactions [20]. In order to keep the mathematical analysesmanageable, we consider a much smaller network consisting ofsome key players (see Methods for a narrative description of the cell
cycle). The logic of our network was constructed based on thedescriptions of the cell cycle interaction as given in section 3.1 of[12], which is an expansion of the network found in [5]. All nodes,the species they represent and the logic associated to each node,
are available in The Cell Collective (www.thecellcollective.org).
Figure 1 shows the static interaction graph of the model. Themodel used in this study has four external inputs: cell size signal(CSS ) to model cell growth, the Start checkpoint ( Start ), the
budding (or morphogenic) checkpoint ( BuddingCP ) and the
spindle assembly checkpoint ( SpindleCP ). Each of these external
inputs plays a different role. First consider Start ,BuddingCP , and
SpindleCP . Each external input is incorporated into the logic of
an internal node(s) so as to mimic the biological behavior ofa checkpoint. Activating one of these external inputs (setting it to 1)indicates that the corresponding checkpoint has been satisfied. Inpre-Start cells, Cln3cannot inhibit Whi 5nor can Cln2be
activated unless the critical size threshold has been reached; henceStart is integrated into the logic of Whi5 and Cln2 as follows: if
Start~0thenWhi 5~1andCln2~0[21–24]. The external input
BuddingCP corresponds to the correct formation of the bud neck
and the localization and subsequent degradation of Swe1 [25–27].As such, we say that if BuddingCP ~0then Swe 1~1. Lastly,
SpindleCP corresponds to the spindle assembly checkpoint which
modulates the activation of Cdc20: if SpindleCP ~0then
Cdc 20~0[28,29].
Finally, CSS is a signal representing cell size. It is known that
cell size regulates the cell cycle via its correlation with Cln3 levels.The mechanism governing this regulation involves a complexnetwork of biochemical interactions [30,31], and has been omittedfor simplicity. Unlike the external nodes representing cell cyclecheckpoints, which are binary in nature (either satisfied or not), theCSS external input is inherently continuous (cell size varies
continuously over time). To represent this continuous signal passedfrom the cell and its environment to activate Cln3at a given
moment, a probability ( q) that CSS is active is defined:
p(CSS~1)~q[(0,1) . This signal is relative as p(CSS~1)~1
indicates Cln3is receiving the strongest activation signal.
The cell cycle was modeled as a sequential activation of the
checkpoints. In other words, the pre-start or G1 phase wasmodeled by setting all checkpoints to 0. The G1/S phase ismodeled by setting Start to 1. For the G2/M phase, BuddingCP is
set to 1; finally, the M/G1 phase is modeled via the activation oftheSpindleCP checkpoint. Hence, the cell cycle as a whole results
in a sequence of probabilistic Boolean control networks (PBCNs) (see the
Methods section for detailed discussion of PBCNs) as follows:(CSS ,Start ,BuddingCP ,SpindleCP )~
(q
1(t),0,0,0) ?(q2(t),1,0,0) ?(q3(t),1,1,0) ?(q4(t),1,1,1)
Call these PBCN1 ,PBCN2 ,PBCN3 ,PBCN4 , where each qi(t)is
the control function governing CSS during each modeled phase.
The question is then: does each PBCN behave in accordance with
the phase assigned to it by the status of its checkpoints? In the next
section, the results of our analyses of the dynamics of these PBCNs
are presented.
Cyclin Activity Profiles Correspond to Ergodic Sets
To demonstrate how PBCNs can be used to visualize and
analyze the dynamics of biological systems, we first show that
ergodic sets correspond to cell phenotypes; i.e., cyclin activity
patterns of the individual cell cycle phases, in our case. Each PBCN
was analyzed, and ergodic sets were calculated. The question we
then asked: Do the cyclin activity functions of the individual
ergodic sets (and hence the modeled cell cycle phases) correspond
to the cyclin activity profiles during the cell cycle as seen in the
laboratory? In other words, does our model represent the
biological reality? In fact, the results of our analyses (discussedbelow) indicate that the presented model accurately captures many
of the features of the species’ expected behavior (i.e., their activity
levels) during each cell cycle phase. In Figure 2 the ergodic sets
associated with each PBCN and the corresponding activity
functions of key cyclins as a function of q~CSS are summarized.
For each of the PBCNs exactly one ergodic set was found (ES1-4,
Figure 2A). For (ES1) the cyclin activity functions (column 1 in
Panel C) is consistent with pre-start G1 cells. The cyclin activity
functions of ergodic sets for PBCN2 andPBCN3 are consistent with
the G1/S and G2/M phase of the cell cycle, respectively (columns
2 and 3 in Figure 2A and B). Finally, during the last stage, the
cyclin activity functions of PBCN4 is consistent with M/G1 phase
when CSS is decreasing. That is, the cyclin dependent kinases
(e.g., Cln1{3,Clb2, etc.) deactivate while the cyclin kinase
inhibitors (e.g., Sic1andCdh 1) reactivate. Thus we see that in fact
each PBCN does behave according the phase assigned to it by the
status of its checkpoints.
In order to model the dynamics of the cell cycle as a whole we
must consider how CSS is changing over time. Choosing an
appropriate q
i(t)fori~1,2,3,4 as the control functions for CSS
for each corresponding phase we may see the behavior of each
species across the cell cycle as a whole. As time is arbitrary in our
model, we chose qi(t)to have the ithquarter of the unit interval as
its domain, and thus the modeled cell cycle to take one unit of
time. To organize the transition from one phase to the next we
suppose that if one concatenates those functions into a single
function q(t)~qi(t)ift[½i{1
4,i
4/C138the overall behavior of CSS should
mimic cell size; i.e., it should grow for the majority of the cell cycle
and drop at the end. Furthermore, we assume that Cln3 peaks
when it is receiving the maximum signal. It has been shown that
the level of Cln3 rises and falls over the cell cycle and peaks
sometime during M phase [16,32]. Thus we let qi(t)~4
3twith
domain ½i{1
4,i
4/C138fori~1,2,3 andq4(t)~{ 4tz4with domain
½3
4,1/C138. (Note that the dynamical properties of the model are highly
robust to variations of the function, and thus our choice of the
control functions, as discussed in the Robustness section. ).
Consequently for each species, a piecewise function that governs
its activity across the cell cycle was constructed by composing each
node’s activity function with qi(t)during each corresponding
phase of the cell cycle. In Figure 3, one can see the controlErgodic Sets for BYCC

function for CSS over the whole cell cycle on the left and the
corresponding activity of selected cyclins across the whole cellcycle on the right. It is clear that we are able to reproduce thegeneral structure of the cell cycle. Cyclin kinase inhibitors areactive in G1, followed by their deactivation and the activation ofthe G1 cyclins Clb5 and Cln2. Then the G1 cyclins deactivate andClb2 activates. Finally Clb2 deactivation correlates with Cdc20activation as the cell progresses through M phase, and thereactivation of the CKIs. (See Methods for a narrative description of
the cell cycle.) Direct comparison of the shape of the calculatedactivity profiles to experimental studies in [16] (via cyclebase.org)revealed a strong correspondence (Figure 4). Exceptions to thiscorrespondence with results from [16] were the dynamics ofCdc14 and Cdh1. Our model predicts that Cdc14 is activated latein the M phase (while inactive during the previous phases). Thisbehavior appears however to be consistent with another study thatsuggested that Cdc14 activation occurs in late mitosis [33]. Also,while the activation profile of Cdh1 predicted by our model
doesn’t agree with the results in [16], it appears to be consistentwith the activation profile described in Figure 2 in [4] (as well as allother species common to each model). Thus not only does ourmodel’s results compare to laboratory results but also to the resultsof a differential equation model. Note that the activity levels ofWhi 5,Sic1,Cln2,Clb2, and Cdc 20also qualitatively correspond
to the combination of activity and localization measured in the cell(see Figure 3 in [17]). Together, these data suggest that, in fact,ergodic sets can model cell phenotypes. Furthermore, as visualizedin Figure 3 and Figure 4, a secondary peak of the G1 Cyclins ( Cln2
andClb5in particular) was found as the cell transitions from
PBCN3 toPBCN4 . In fact, this phenomenon was also observed in
the laboratory [16]. This is also a feature of the cyclin activityprofiles of the respective ergodic sets. Notice also that this peak isnot purely a result of the function that we chose for CSS . While
the shape of the peak may change, its existence is intrinsic to the

logic of the network; that is, so long as CSS does not drop instantly
to zero when the spindle assembly checkpoint has been satisfied,
there will be some sharp rise and fall of Cln2andClb5.
Start, Irreversibility, and Commitment to the Cell Cycle
The irreversible nature of the Start signal was explored in [18]
by investigating the positive feedback loop that exists between
Cln2,SBFo (‘‘SMBF ’’ in our model) and Whi 5(see Figure 1). As
can be seen in Figure 3B, the bi-stability of Cln2is clearly
represented in the transition from the G1 ergodic set (ES1) where
Cln2is inactive to the S-phase ergodic set (ES2) where Cln2is
active. Notice that in PBCN1 , the Whi 5-Cln2-SMBF feedback
loop cannot be initiated, as Whi 5is active and Cln2is inactive
until the Start signal has been received. On the other hand, in the
post-Start phase (i.e., PBCN2 ),Whi 5is now inhibiting itself as
a result of the Start -activated feedback loop. This suggests that the
feedback loop is inherent to the irreversibility of Start .
In the aforementioned work [18], the authors showed that
removing Cln2from the feedback loop allows the reactivation of
Whi 5following an exogenous pulse of Cln2, rendering Start
reversible. To perform an analogous inquiry on our model, and to
investigate the role of the feedback loop, we eliminated Cln2as an
upstream regulator of Whi 5and re-analyzed PBCN2 . A singleergodic set was found, whose cyclin activity profile is pictured in
Figure 5A. The functions from the activity profiles of ES1 and
ES2, that govern Cln2when the feedback loop is present are
constant functions, and thus have no dependence on CSS .I n
contrast, Cln2oandWhi 5activities are now a function of CSS
(Figure 5A). In other words, if the CSS stimulus is removed from
Cln3,Cln2becomes inactive and Whi 5reactivates, indicating
a return to G1 phase and a renewed possibility of G1 arrest due to
mating pheromone [34]. The transition to S phase is now
reversible. Though the context of our model and what was done in
[18] are different, the result is the same – the irreversibility of the
G1/S transition is dependent on the positive feedback loop.
That the functions for the cyclins in the G1, S, and G2 phases
are constant has another implication for our model. Specifically,
once the Start signal has been received, the typical (oscillating)
activity profiles of the key cyclins will ensue even when stimulus of
Cln3 by cell size is incoherent, so long as the checkpoints are
satisfied. In other words, once the cell receives the Start signal, it
commits to a round of cell division.
Robustness
Robustness of biological systems is critical to the proper function
of processes such as the cell cycle. Within our modeling regime

noise is interpreted as the systems’ sensitivity to the control
function, and the robustness of the ergodic sets to randomperturbations, respectively. To consider the system’s sensitivity tothe control function, we considered the activity functions of theergodic sets. As noted in the previous section, the activity functionsgoverning most of the key species in the system are constant, andhence independent of CSS during the first three phases of the cell
cycle. In particular, Cln2,Clb5, and Clb2, which drive bud
formation, DNA replication, and mitosis, respectively, have theiractivities governed by constant functions. This indicates that solong as the checkpoints are appropriately activated (i.e., theenvironment is stable enough for the successful completion of thecurrent phase), the modeled cell will progress through the cell cycleindependently of CSS (i.e., cell size). Therefore our model is
robust to the variable behavior of the cell growth.
Furthermore, this is also consistent with the findings in [19] that
a cell deprived of nitrogen will proceed through one round ofdivision and arrest in G1. We modeled this scenario by removingthe cell size signal ( CSS ) right after Start has been satisfied.
Consistent with [35], as a control function we chose q

fort[½0,1=4/C138and qi(t)~1=100 fort[(i{1
4,i
4/C138,i~1,2,3 . The
dynamics of modeled cyclins are depicted in Figure 5B. During the
first three phases, the activities of the species are the same as thenormal cell cycle (Figure 2). The activities of the species during thelast phase are also consistent with a cell in the G1 phase. That is,the modeled cell has completed a round of division and arrested inG1. This may suggest that the phenomenon of completing a cellcycle without appreciable growth is a consequence of therobustness of the cell cycle to variable external environments,and is inherent to the logic of the biological regulatory networkgoverning the yeast cell cycle.
In addition to being able to represent cellular phenotypes, the
calculated ergodic sets (and the number thereof) in the previoussection have another implication. Similar to attractors in Booleannetwork, ergodic sets can provide insights into the robustness ofthe modeled biological systems.A standard approach to analyze robustness is to consider the
basins of attractions of each attractor and interpret its relative sizeas a measure of stability (e.g., [5]). The concept of a basin ofattraction for an ergodic set in a PBCN is not well defined; this is
due to the fact that a random walk initiated from a single state in
the state space may arrive at different ergodic sets. However, each
of the PBCNs have a single ergodic set which means that any
perturbation will eventually return to the ergodic set (and can bemodeled by its associated cyclin activity functions). As such, we seethat the modeled G1, G1/S, G2/M and M/G1 phases of the cellcycle are highly robust in the face of perturbations. Together, ourresults suggest that each phase of the modeled cell cycle is robust aswell as the cell cycle as a whole.
Discussion
Results presented herein are twofold. First, as suggested in [8],
we show that it is possible to model cellular phenotype as ergodicsets in the context of probabilistic Boolean control networks. Incontrast to previous works utilizing Boolean models, our approachcenters around understanding not only the cell cycle as a whole,but also its individual phases. Specifically, we modeled the cellcycle as a sequence of models, each representing an individualphase in the cycle. This approach has significant implications as tohow the dynamics of the modeled cell cycle are interpreted and arecompared with experimental studies. Specifically, in previousworks the yeast cell cycle was modeled as a single system where thephases were represented as transient states leading to a (fixedpoint) attractor corresponding to the G1 phase [5], or asconsecutive states in a cyclic attractor [12,13]. Considering eachphase as an evolving system of its own enabled us to capturecontinuous dynamics of key species during each phase andcompare them to laboratory studies. Modeling each phaseseparately and transitioning between models via the activation ofcheckpoints is also consistent with the biological observations thatit is not only kinase activity that causes phase transitions, but the
completion of each phases task [36].

cyclebase.org. Each node in the network may represent several species. In the case that a node represents more than one species its calculated
activity profile is compared to the experimental activation of the species to which it most clearly correlates. For example, the node Yhp1 in our modelrepresents the species YHP1 and YOX1. We thus compare the calculated profile of the node Yhp1 to YOX1, as they appear to have the bestcorrespondence. Numbered peaks and valleys identify our interpretation of the correlation between plots.

Similar to [5,12,13] we find that each phase of the cell cycle and
thus the cell cycle as a whole is robust as measured by basin size,i.e. the existence of a single ergodic set for each phase. Stability ofthe yeast cell cycle has also been considered in the framework ofprobabilistic Boolean networks, concluding the cell cycle attractoris robust to internal noise [7,15,37]. However, this approach isincompatible with our goal of exploring the relevance of ergodicsets as it renders the entire state space a single ergodic set.Modeling extracellular signals as continuous variables (i.e., cellsize) allowed us show the stability of the yeast cell cycle networkunder different choices of control functions, a question precludedby previous modeling techniques. Lastly, taking the perspective ofqualitative activity introduced in [1] we are able to directlyincorporate the role of cell size into our model. The furthercorrelation of cell size with time also allows us to escape thediscrete time of other Boolean network models.
Evidence is increasing that biological processes possess complex
properties that emerge from the dynamics of the system working asa whole (e.g., [1,30,38–41]). To better understand these emergentproperties, large-scale computational models of the complexbiological interactions will be needed. The size of the buddingyeast cell cycle network in this work is relatively small and makesthe analytic calculations manageable. Larger and more compre-hensive models will be key in systems biology. For example,understanding how the cell controls checkpoints via additionalregulatory network pathways, and how to incorporate thisunderstanding into current models is of paramount importance.Thus the question of how to approach large networks is importantin extending these results to truly life-size scales. To deal with suchscales simulation techniques and software (such as The CellCollective; http://www.thecellcollective.org) will be an importantpart of extending these results to large models.Methods
Budding Yeast Cell Cycle
Newborn cells begin in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where
they start growing. It isn’t until the cell reaches a critical size thata round of division begins [42]. This transition point is referred toasStart, and is irreversible; that is, once the Start signal is received,
the cell is no longer susceptible to G1 arrest due to matingpheromone, and the cell has committed to a round of division,[18,42,43]. The activity profile of the biochemical networkunderlying the cell cycle during the initial G1 phase ischaracterized by the increasing activity of the Cln3 cyclin inresponse to the cell’s increasing size, and the activity of the cyclinkinase inhibitor (CKI) Sic1 [42]. The transition to S phase occursonce the critical size has been reached, i.e. Start has occurred, and
Cln1, 2 has become active and Sic1 has been inactivated. Theinactivity of Sic1 allows the activation of Clb5. Having transi-tioned to S phase, the cells characteristic cyclin activity pattern isthe activity of Cln1, 2 and Clb5 and the inactivity of Sic1. DuringS phase, Cln1, 2 allow bud and spindle-pole body formation, whilethe activity of Clb5 allows DNA replication [18,23]. In G2 phase,Clb2 (the primary mitotic cyclin) accumulates [44], and Swe1 isdegraded in the newly formed bud neck [25–27]. In fact, budformation (along with other nuclear events) constitutes anotherquality control point: a morphogenic checkpoint [27]. The activity
of Clb2 is sustained into early M phase [44,45]. Thus one may say
that active Clb2 (and inactive Sic1) characterizes the G2/M phaseof the cell cycle. Further progression through M phase is governedby another checkpoint: the spindle assembly checkpoint. Once thechromosomes are correctly aligned on the mitotic spindle, Cdc20,a co-factor of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), is released from inhibition. The cell then willprogress through the rest of M phase and divide into a mother anddaughter cell in G1 phase, awaiting another round of division.

Thus, the activation and deactivation of Cdc20 and the
corresponding recovery of the Sic1 and Cdh1 and characterizethe M/G1 phase of the cell cycle [29,46]. It is this oscillatingactivity of cyclin-dependent kinases that ‘‘act as the masterregulator for cell cycle progression’’ [47].

Modeling Framework
As noted in the Introduction section, the modeling framework
herein was suggested by [1]. The essential perspective of thisframework is to suppose that at every moment of time, ourbiological system is being modeled by the stationary distribution ofan irreducible Markov chain, whose states are an irreduciblesubset of the state space for a probabilistic Boolean network (whichitself is a reducible Markov chain).
Consider a collection of n nodes fx
1,...xng, representing
biological entities, each taking a value in f0,1g, and n{mBoolean
functions fi:f0,1gn?f0,1g,i~1,...,n{m, where the function fiis the logical rule governing xmzi. Call the nodes xmz1,...,xn
internal nodes and call nodes x1,...xmexternal inputs, as they are
not governed by a Boolean function. Decompose the state space of
the original nnodes as the direct sum f0,1gm+f0,1gn{mso that
forv+w[f0,1gm+f0,1gn{mvrepresents the state of the external
inputs and wrepresents the state of the internal nodes. Notice that
for each v[f0,1gmwe may define Fv:f0,1gn{m?f0,1gn{mby
Fv(w)~(f1(v+w),...,fn{m(v+w))(we suppress the notation for
the standard inclusion of the direct sum). Thus we have defineda family of 2
mBoolean networks consisting of the internal nodes,
one for each vector in f0,1gm.
Suppose that to each external input xiwe associate a function
qi(t)taking values in (0,1) with t[D, some arbitrary domain
representing time. Call qi(t)a control function. We suppose that
this probability represents the qualitative activation of the species
represented by xiat time t. Let t[Dbe fixed and consider the
probability distribution nt on f0,1gmgiven by

governs the system once it has reached the ergodic set. With the matrix is associated a unit modulus eigenvector that provides the invariant
distribution for the system. D) Each state of the ergodic set gives the activities of the internal nodes. Taking the sum of these binary vectors weighte d
by the invariant distribution gives the likelihood that a particular node is active. Thus on the right of this expression is the activity function of ea ch

a function of q. In the middle graph, an arbitrary function for q(or the activity level of EI) is plotted as a function of time. In the graph on the right
side, the activities of the network nodes is plotted as a function of the composite function for EIin time (as designed in the middle graph).

Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable malignancy of
mature B-lymphocytes, characterized as being a heterogeneous disease with variable
clinical manifestation and survival. Mutational statuses of rearranged immunoglobulin
heavy chain variable (IGVH) genes has been consider one of the most important
prognostic factors in CLL, but despite of its proven value to predict the course of the
disease, the regulatory programs and bi ological mechanisms responsible for the
differences in clinical behavior are poorly understood.
Methods: In this study, (i) we performed diffe rential gene expression analysis
between the IGVH statuses using multiple and independent CLL cohorts in
microarrays platforms, based on this info rmation, (ii) we constructed a simplified
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and (iii) investigated its structure and
critical genes. This provided the basis to (iv) develop a Boolean model, (v) infer
biological regulatory mechanism and (vi) performed perturbation simulations in
order to analyze the network in dynamic state.
Results: The result of topological analysis and the Boolean model showed that the
transcriptional relationships of IGVH mutational status were determined by specific
regulatory proteins (PTEN, FOS, EGR1, TNF, TGFBR3, IFGR2 and LPL). The dynamics
of the network was controlled by attractors whose genes were involved in
multiple and diverse signaling pathways, which may suggest a variety of
mechanisms related with progression oc curring over time in the disease. The
overexpression of FOS and TNF fixed the f ate of the system as they can activate
important genes implicated in the regul ation of process of adhesion, apoptosis,
immune response, cell proliferation and other signaling pathways related with
cancer.
Conclusion: The differences in prognosis predic tion of the IGVH mutational status
are related with several regulatory hubs that determine the dynamic of the system.

Background
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of adult leukemia in de-
veloped countries, is an incurable malignancy of mature B lymphocytes, characterized
by accumulation of mature B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymphoid
organs such as the lymph nodes (LN) [1, 2]. Patients with CLL show a highly variable

disease evolution and different response to therapy. This variability may be related to
evolutionary dynamics of sub-clonal mutations [3]. Investigations of the B cell receptor
(BCR) indicate that 60 –65 % of CLLs carry immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV)
genes with evidence of somatic hypermutation and this may modify BCR affinity for
antigens. Conversely, 35 –40 % of CLLs are devoid of IGHV somatic mutations [4].
Understanding the pathological mechanisms of CLL has helped to divide the disease
into two risk categories that have a strong impact on prognosis and treatment: 1)
patients with minimal clinical manifestations and 2) an aggressive form characterized
by high mortality, whose IGHV genes can be somatically mutated or unmutated,
respectively. Due to the importance of IGVH status in the determination of the course
of the disease, several expression studies have focused on the comparison of CLL type
mutated IGVH vs. IGVH unmutated. Nevertheless, these studies have identified genes
that are not functionally related and therefore cannot elucidate biological mechanisms
to distinguish between risk categories.
The interactions of proteins are essential to execute biological functions in different
contexts [5]. Since cancer is a complex and multi-factorial disease involving diverse
anomalies, the representation and analysis of a malignant cell as a protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network can provide insights into its behavior. It has been postulated
that proteins with high connectivity within a PPI network could represent meaningful
biological information, despite non-being differentially expressed [6]. Thus, the inte-
grated analysis of gene expression data with PPI networks could be valuable method to
provide knowledge into molecular mechanisms of diseases. The analyses of PPI
networks have varied applications such as identification of drug targets, functional
protein modules and disease candidate genes [7, 8].
On the other hand, dynamic network modeling can be used to gain insight into the
functionality of biological processed and made possible simulations to predict models
behavior [9]. Modeling of regulatory networks as dynamical systems includes modeling
based on ordinary differential equations [10, 11], Bayesian framework [12] and Boolean
rules [13, 14]. Given the limitation of quantitative models that need knowledge on the
kinetics and mechanistic parameters of the system, in addition of a wealth of qualitative
and interaction data obtained from the experimental literature and high-throughput
technologies, the qualitative approaches such as Boolean modeling become an ex-
tremely useful resource [15].
The Boolean modeling considers the genes as binary variables being either active or
passive, but encompassing the essential functionality of the system, the general building
blocks that have been identified in Boolean networks constitute different types of
robust switching elements [16]. This type of approach is already successfully applied in
complex models as the FA/BRCA pathway in Fanconi anemia [17], the survival process
of in large granular lymphocyte leukemia [18], process of T-helper lymphocytes [19]
and the control of the mammalian cell cycle [20].
In this study, we constructed a simplified PPI network of the IGVH mutational status
in CLL and analyzed its structure and critical genes. We used the topology of the
network to develop a Boolean model, infer regulatory mechanisms and perform
simulations to analyze the network in dynamic state. The modeling of the PPI network
led to identify regulatory elements of the disease, contributing to understand the prog-
nostic differences and the dynamic behavior under different perturbations over time.Álvarez-Silva et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling  (2015) 12:12 Page 2 of 15
Results
We inquired into the impact of differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the IGVH
statuses by mapping them onto the PPI network. The initial data set of 502 DE genes
was reduced to 90 genes with the softwa re STRING and exhaustive literature
reviewed. The PPI network reconstructed co ntains 90 nodes and 120 regulatory edges
(Fig. 1). An additional table shows the funct ions of all genes implicated in the network
(Additional file 1: Table S1). The resulting simplified network made evident that DEG
between IGVH statuses are not always represented by highly connected nodes.
The main topological characteristic of the network is the degree distribution P(k),w h i c h
tells us the probability that a select node has exactly klinks. The degree distribution P(k)
allows us to distinguish between different types of biological networks. We obtained a
power-law degree distribution which characterize scale free networks (Fig. 2), where the
probability that a node displays klinks follows P(k) ∼k−γ,w h e r e γis the degree exponent
that describes the role of the hubs in the system [21]. In the PPI network we obtained
values of γbetween 2 and 3, indicating that there exist a hierarchy of hubs, i.e. there are a
large number of nodes with few connections while highly connected nodes are scarce
[21]. The following genes showed the highest values in degree evaluation: in-degree
(PTEN, FOS, and EGR1) and out-degree (TNF, TGFBR3, and IFGR2). Values of γbetween
2 and 3 refer also to the small-world property [22], characterized by a small value of diam-
eter, which increase the network efficiency. However, we obtained a value of diameter of
8, greater-than-expected for networks with the small-world property. To explain the
values of diameter higher to the expected, Zhang et al. [22] made a comparison between
the values of diameter reported for real biological networks regarding to diameters ob-
tained for networks with the same features in which the connections between nodes are
randomized. Specifically, they evaluated the diameter of protein-protein interaction

expression. Blue nodes: high expressionÁlvarez-Silva et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling  (2015) 12:12 Page 3 of 15
networks of biological organisms in contrast to the obtained in randomized networks.
Their simulation showed that an increment of the diameter in the real networks allows a
significant increase of the network modularity, suggesting an adjustment between network
efficiency and the benefits obtainable by modularity [22].
This analysis was completed by other centralities measures such as closeness and be-
tweenness, which provide a characterization of nodes that are relevant for the network
structure. Closeness is defined by the inverse of the average length of the shortest paths
to all other nodes [23]. We found TNF, TGFBR3, and IFGR2 as proteins with the high-
est closeness values in the PPI network. A protein with high closeness, compared to
the average closeness of the network, will be easily central to the regulation of other
proteins but with some proteins not influenced by its activity [24]. Implying that those
proteins are the closest to all other nodes and have an extent of influences on the entire

network. This parameter can also be considered a measure of how long it will take in-
formation to spread from a given node to others [25]. Betweenness is defined by the
number of shortest paths that pass through a node [26]. The betweenness index favors
nodes that join communities rather than nodes that lie inside a community [27, 28].
FOS, TNF and LPL exhibited the highest values, implying a role as linkers in the
control of interactions betw een proteins. Selected genes, reported above, can be seen
in Fig. 3. The overall parameters that characterized the network are shown in the
Additional file 2: Table S2, and the topological parameters for each one of the nodes

We saw that centrality measures in the PPI network shown some degrees of overlap,
stressing the importance of the implicated proteins in the system structure. According
to Yu et al. [29], as a complementary notion of highly connected proteins known as
hubs proteins, it is possible to define bottlenecks proteins as proteins with high be-
tweenness values, bottlenecks proteins are essential connectors with surprising func-
tional and dynamic properties. Therefore, to develop a Boolean model and evaluate the
genes with influence in the behavior of the network over time, we focused on those that
were at the center of the major structural hubs and simultaneously exhibited the highest
values in the topological centralities evaluated. The selected nodes were: FOS, PTEN,
TGFBR3, and TNF. The dependencies between the genes obtained from the literature re-
view were translated to rule sets. The biological events for activation or inhibition were
qualitatively represented by Boolean functions, that is, combinations of AND, OR, and
NOT operations, that determine the evolution of a node through time and their relation
to the other components of the system (Additional file 4: Table S4).
Starting from an initial condition, the Boolean model evolved over time to finally
stabilizes in a recurrent state known as attractor, representing the long-term behavior
of the system [15]. We found a simple attractor for the PPI network for CLL consisting
of one state. The model obtained achieves the fixed point (steady state) after six time
steps. The state of transition and its successor attractor (starting from the initial state
determined by microarray analysis) are shown in Fig. 4. Starting from 50 random initial
states, the system had both the single-state attractors and cycle attractors. The major
cycle attractors displayed four states (Fig. 5). This showed important dependency of the
achieved attractor according to the initial system state.
Given the relevance of signaling pathways as triggers of processes associated with
cancer oncogenesis and progression, the activated proteins in the attractor were
subjected to modular functional enrichment to determine annotations from KEGG and
Panther pathways simultaneously. The associated annotations involved various
pathways related to cancer with statistical significance for focal adhesion (corrected p
value = 0.000231747). Other signaling pathways detected in the attractor included: B
cell receptor, T cell receptor, cytokine-cytokine, integrin, and cadherin, among others.
Processes related with cell proliferation and regulations of transcription were also
present.
Given the overriding importance attributed to FOS and TNF in cancer biology and
their high topological measures in the PPI network, we chose these genes to performed
perturbation simulations of knockout and overexpression in the system. Furthermore,
we analyzed the effect of different initial conditions that can lead the system to different
steady states (attractors). The two initial conditions that were taken into account were: i)Álvarez-Silva et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling  (2015) 12:12 Page 5 of 15
initial condition determined by microarray analysis and ii) an initial state in which all
nodes were active.
The overexpression of FOS produced activation of genes related with multiples sig-
naling pathways. When comparing activated genes under the FOS overexpression re-
gardless of activated genes in the original attractor, the modular functional analysis
found the MAPK signaling pathway with the most significant value, ( p= 4.37211e-05).
Other pathways involved were: apoptosis ( p= 7.34148e-05), PDGF ( p= 0.000100226),
JAK-STAT ( p= 0.0001216), angiogenesis ( p= 0.0001216) and cytokine-cytokine inter-
action ( p= 0.000500178). Similarly, activated genes under TNF overexpression were
involved in multiple signaling pathways associated with cancer: focal adhesion ( p=
7.05488e-07), angiogenesis ( p= 8.39556e-07), JAK-STAT ( p= 1.39118e-06), tight junc-
tion ( p= 5.76719e-06), MAPK ( p= 7.60619e-06), Wnt ( p= 0.000105245), among others.
Under both initial conditions the effect of knocking out of any gene did not display
an effect, since the same attractor was obtained when no gene was knocked out. Never-
theless, the path length to achieve the attractor varies significantly, that is, depending
on the initial conditions, the system takes more or less steps of evolution in time to
stabilize in a recurrent state, known as attractor. From this behavior of the system, it
can be concluded that the attractor achieved is the most stable state of the network,
because although there are perturbations involving the system, the network returns to
the same steady state after different steps of time evolution.
On the other hand, when constantly maintaining the major nodes active under the
two initial conditions studied, we found that the selected gene displayed an effect on
the attractor achieved and therefore on the behavior of the system, affecting evolution

of the network. These changes in the behavior are important to determine its relation
to the evolution of the disease.
Under both conditions of perturbation, the overexpression of the gene FOS and TNF
showed important influence in the evolution over time of the system (Fig. 6). In both
cases the system reaches complex attractors in which the network oscillates among a
set of four states, i.e., the attractor of the network is a cycle. In these states the nodes
involved in regulation of CLL oscillate under states of OFF or ON, which affects the
course of the disease.
Discussion
We applied a system approach by linking proteins interaction data with differentially
expressed genes of the IGVH status, the reconstructed PPI network allowed identified
critical genes, and given the stringent parameters applied, they represent only relation-
ships based on strong protein interactions. The topology of the reconstructed PPI net-
work followed the power-law of node degree distribution, a feature of true complex
biological networks. Therefore, the obtained network is a scale-free biological entity ra-
ther than a random network, indicating the presence of few nodes having a very high
degree measure [21]. On the other hand, it is recognized that high values of degree cen-
trality are associated with proteins that are interacting with several others suggesting a
central regulatory role [23]. The degree index highlighted some important proteins with
regulatory functions and considered interactions hubs in the PPI network: PTEN, FOS,
EGR1, TNF, TGFBR3, and IFGR2. According to the lethality and centrality rule, the
highly connected nodes are biologically relevant, representing vulnerable and essential

points to system viability [30, 31], supporting this argument the establishment and
stability of cancer cells through these hubs.
It was noted that highly connected proteins in the PPI network are not necessarily
represented for highly DEG. Consequently, genes with a central role in cancer not
detected for high-throughput approaches could be identified by networks based analysis
[6]. This was the case for PTEN, FOS, EGR1 and TNF, whose p values were significant
but they were not among the lowest in the meta-analysis. Several genes with known
prognostic implications in CLL were present in the list of DEG; additionally, the top
DEG obtained were consistent with other studies [32 –34], validating these findings the
microarray meta-analysis approach to produce robust conclusions.
LPL is one for the strongest prognostic markers to predict outcome in CLL [35, 36].
It was one of the genes with high betweenness index, reflecting the large amount of
control exerted by this node over the interactions between the other nodes, in this way,
LPL may function as bridge between sub-graphs. According to Kolset and Salmivirta
[37] LPL facilitate the contact between monocytes and endothelial cell through its
union with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, serving as a bridging protein between cell
surface proteins and lipoproteins. On the other hand, LPL may influence CLL behavior
for its relation with functional pathways involved in fatty acid degradation and signaling
[38].
All genes found with high centralities have central roles in cancer and are involved in
major, diverse and sometimes interrelated signaling pathways. They have roles as tumor
suppressors or oncogenes, engaging central role in cancer progression. PTEN has
phosphatase catalytic function that antagonizes the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and

suppresses cell survival as well as cell proliferation [39]. TNF gene encodes a multifunc-
tional proinflammatory cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) super-
family, can induce a wide range of intracellular signal pathways including apoptosis and
cell survival as well as inflammation and immunity. TNF has two receptors (TNFR1,
TNFR2), TNFR1 signaling induces activation of many genes, primarily controlled by
two distinct pathways, NF-kappa B pathway and the MAPK cascade, or apoptosis and
necrosis. TNFR2 signaling activates NF-kappa B pathway, including PI3K-dependent
NF-kappa B pathway and JNK pathway leading to survival [40]. FOS gene family
encodes leucine zipper proteins that can dimerize with proteins of the JUN family,
thereby forming the transcription factor complex AP-1. As such, the FOS proteins have
been implicated as regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation.
In some cases, expression of the FOS gene has also been associated with apoptotic cell

death [41]. Studies about EGR1 have been suggested that it is a cancer suppressor gene
and a transcriptional regulator. The products of target genes it activates are required
for differentiation and mitogenesis [42]. TGFBR3 is a membrane proteoglycan that
functions as a co-receptor with other transforming growth factors receptors. Soluble
TGFBR3 may inhibit TGFB signaling. Decreased expression of this receptor has been
observed in various cancers [41].
When the attractors found in the analysis of Boolean model are analyzed, several key
proteins associated with specific signaling pathways related with cancer are found, it
became clear that the phenotype depends upon multiple and interrelated signaling
pathways. We underscore the importance of MAPK signaling pathway, identified by
enrichment analysis, under FOS overexpression in the Boolean model. Belonging to the
MAPK/ERK signaling cascade were found activated: CASP3, FGFR1, AKT3, FOS,
MAP2K6, MAP4K4, PRKCA, RPS6KA5, and TNF. Aberrations in the MAPK/ERK
pathway have been identified in human cancers in high frequency including
hematologic malignancies [42]. In the context of CLL, the MAPK signaling pathway
has been recently implied in the disease based on clustering of RNA sequencing data
[43]. Similarly, working with gene co-expression subnetworks associated with disease
progression, it has been proven association of MAPK pathway with higher expression
levels in patients at early stages of the disease [44].
The regulatory hubs determine the behavior of the disease over time. The dynamics
of the network is controlled by attractors involved of diverse signaling pathways, which
may suggest a variety of mechanisms controlling the difference in CLL behavior. “The
2 distinct disease ”hypothesis in CLL could be challenged; it is an interesting approach
to speculate that the CLL disease transcriptome evolves over time to reach a state
associated with disease requiring treatment [44]. These results have implications for
understanding transcriptional dynamic in the evolution of the disease.
Conclusion
The PPI network and a Boolean model of IGVH mutational status in CLL allowed iden-
tified regulatory proteins and generated insight about processes associated with the mani-
fest differences in prognosis. The perturbation in the network through overexpression of
important regulatory proteins, such as FOS and TNF, determine the dynamic of the
network and activate genes involved in different signaling pathways that play important
roles in cancer.
Methods
Differential expression analysis between the IGVH mutational statuses
To ensure reliability and generalization of results, we combined information from
different and independent microarray expression cohorts. It is well known that integra-
tion of expression data allow the discovery of new biological insights by increasing the
statistical power [45]. We retrieved CLL cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The cohorts
selected (GSE2466, GSE16746, GSE9992 and GSE38611) had raw data available, were
originally processed with different microarray platforms and had at least 60 CLL
patients with information about the IGVH statuses, in total were processed 356 CLLÁlvarez-Silva et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling  (2015) 12:12 Page 10 of 15
patients (174 mutated/umutated status). Each study was normalized independently
using the VSN method implemented in R [46]. For filtering non-expressed and non-
informative genes, matching genes among different microarray platforms and merging
among studies, we used MetaDE package in R [47]. To combining the information of
cohorts and avoid batch effect we followed a meta-analysis approach, the moderated-t
statstics with permutations was used for individual analysis and Fisher P-value combin-
ation method for combine the individual p values [48]. For meta-analysis we used the
“MetaOmics ”software suite [47].
Reconstruction of protein –protein interaction network
The reconstruction of the protein –protein interaction network was based on data from
differential expression analysis between IGVH mutational statuses. The list of 502 DE
genes obtained was used to retrieve interacting partners from curated databases and
current literature.
The protein –protein interaction network was constructed based on the current litera-
ture and, through the STRING —Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/
Proteins —web source [49]. The STRING database contains information from several
sources, including experimental data, computational prediction methods, public text
collection and an recompilation of predicted protein interactions of databases such as
EXPASY [50], BIND [51], BioGRID [52], DIP [53], IntAct MINT [54], and HPRD [55]
and with interactions from the pathway databases such as PID [56], Reactome [57],
KEGG [58], and EcoCyc [59].
In order to reduce the amount of data while maintaining the main gene relations, the
parameters of confidence for STRING were restricted for obtain more reliable associa-
tions. Furthermore, the active prediction methods taken into account for STRING pre-
dictions were: co-expression, experiments, databases, and text mining. From the
protein-protein interactions predicted by STRING, with the restrictions mentioned
above, only the genetic relationships causing the activation or inhibition of the compo-
nents of the network were considered. In this way we reduced the number of network
nodes from 502 to 90. Is important to state that the database predictive methods could
reduce the overall confidence of network.
Network topology analysis
Topological analysis of the protein –protein interaction network was carried out by
plugin Network Analysis [60] of the open source program Cytoscape 3.1.0 [61].
A topological evaluation of the network was carried out by evaluating structural
parameters such as the clustering coefficient and degree distributions, to evaluate the
number of interactions among one node and its neighbors, normalized by the
maximum number of possible interactions, and to determine the number of nodes
directly connected (first neighbors) to a given node v, respectively. In the network
evaluation we distinguished in-degree distribution, when the edges target the node v,
and out-degree distribution, when the edges target the adjacent neighbors of v[62, 60].
The evaluation of the relevance of a protein in the PPI network was also made

Boolean network model
In a Boolean network model, each node i=1 , 2 , …,Nrepresents a protein of the net-
work that can assume only binary states θi. When θi= 1 the protein is functionally ac-
tive (TRUE), on the other hand, when θi= 0 the protein is functionally inactive
(FALSE). Thus, a network with N nodes will have 2 N possible states [21]. In this
model, edges represent regulatory relationships between elements; their orientation in the
network follows the direction of regulation process from the upstream to the downstream
node. As time passes, the state of each node is determined by the states of its neighbor,
through Boolean transfer functions based on evidence from the literature [63, 64].
The exponential behavior of the possible states in a Boolean network makes it com-
putationally unsuitable for large networks, where it is necessary to reduce the network
size, restricting the protein –protein interactions to the relationships of activation or
inhibition of any of the components of the system.
In this study, the Boolean synchronous algorithm proposed by Stuart Alan Kauffman
in 1969 [13] was implemented. The synchronous pattern is the most simple update
mode, where the states of all nodes are updated simultaneously according to the last
state of the network [15]. We used the package BoolNet [65] to construct Boolean
synchronous networks from knowledge of the dependencies of genes, based on
evidence from the current literature.
Starting from an initial condition, the model evolves over time to finally stabilize in a
recurrent state known as attractor, representing the long-term behavior of the system
[15]. Different initial conditions for the model may lead the system to different attrac-
tors, whereby the Boolean model should start from previously known biological infor-
mation; in this model the initial states of the network were determined from results
supplied for microarray analysis of up and down regulation states (Additional file 4:
Table S4). Aiming to prove the sensitivity of the Boolean model, we assayed 50 random
initial states, and demonstrated that the constructed model shows changes in the struc-
ture of the attractor achieved in the steady state under different initial states.
To determine critical proteins for structure and behavior of the system, we examined
the changes in network attractors if a certain component is knocked out (fixed in the
OFF state in the Boolean model) or overexpressed (fixed in the ON state in the Boolean
model). If knocking out or overexpressing a component leads to changes in network
dynamic response, it can be concluded that this component is implicated in the
biological regulation processes [15].
Functional enrichment analysis
Significant concurrent annotations from KEGG and Panther pathways were searched
with GeneCodis software [66 –68].

Abstract
We present schema redescription as a methodology to characterize canalization in automata networks used to model
biochemical regulation and signalling. In our formulation, canalization becomes synonymous with redundancy present in
the logic of automata. This results in straightforward measures to quantify canalization in an automaton (micro-level), whichis in turn integrated into a highly scalable framework to characterize the collective dynamics of large-scale automatanetworks (macro-level). This way, our approach provides a method to link micro- to macro-level dynamics – a crux of
complexity. Several new results ensue from this methodology: uncovering of dynamical modularity (modules in the
dynamics rather than in the structure of networks), identification of minimal conditions and critical nodes to control theconvergence to attractors, simulation of dynamical behaviour from incomplete information about initial conditions, andmeasures of macro-level canalization and robustness to perturbations. We exemplify our methodology with a well-known
model of the intra- and inter cellular genetic regulation of body segmentation in Drosophila melanogaster . We use this
model to show that our analysis does not contradict any previous findings. But we also obtain new knowledge about itsbehaviour: a better understanding of the size of its wild-type attractor basin (larger than previously thought), the
identification of novel minimal conditions and critical nodes that control wild-type behaviour, and the resilience of these to
stochastic interventions. Our methodology is applicable to any complex network that can be modelled using automata, butwe focus on biochemical regulation and signalling, towards a better understanding of the (decentralized) control thatorchestrates cellular activity – with the ultimate goal of explaining how do cells and tissues ‘compute’.

Introduction and Background
The notion of canalization was proposed by Conrad Waddington
[1] to explain why, under genetic and environmental perturba-
tions, a wild-type phenotype is less variable in appearance than
most mutant phenotypes during development. Waddington’sfundamental hypothesis was that the robustness of wild-typephenotypes is the result of a buffering of the developmental process . This
led Waddington to develop the well-known concept of epigenetic
landscape [2,3], where cellular phenotypes are seen, metaphorically,
as marbles rolling down a sloped and ridged landscape as the result
of interactions amongst genes and epigenetic factors. The marbles
ultimately settle in one of the valleys, each corresponding to astable configuration that can be reached via the dynamics of the
interaction network. In this view, genetic and epigenetic pertur-
bations can only have a significant developmental effect if theyforce the natural path of the marbles over the ridges of theepigenetic landscape, thus making them settle in a different valley
or stable configuration.
Canalization, understood as the buffering of genetic and
epigenetic perturbations leading to the stability of phenotypic traits,
has re-emerged recently as a topic of interest in computational andsystems biology [4–10]. However, canalization is an emergent
phenomenon because we can consider the stability of a phenotypictrait both at the micro-level of biochemical interactions, or at the
macro-level of phenotypic behaviour. The complex interactionbetween micro- and macro-level thus makes canalization difficult tostudy in biological organisms – but the field of complex systems hasled to progress in our understanding of this concept. For instance,Conrad [3] provided a still-relevant treatment of evolvability [11] byanalysing the tradeoff between genetic (micro-level) instability andphenotypic (macro-level) stability. This led to the concept of extra-
dimensional bypass , whereby most genetic perturbations are buffered
to allow the phenotype to be robust to most physiologicalperturbations, but a few genetic perturbations (e.g. the addition ofnovel genetic information) provide occasional instability necessaryfor evolution. Conrad highlighted three (micro-level) features of theorganization of living systems that allows them to satisfy thistradeoff: modularity (or compartmentalization), component redundancy ,
and multiple weak interactions . The latter two features are both a form
of redundancy, the first considering the redundancy of componentsand the second considering the redundancy of interactions orlinkages. Perhaps because micro-level redundancy has been positedas one of the main mechanisms to obtain macro-level robustness,the term canalization has also been used – especially in discretemathematics – to characterize redundant properties of automatafunctions, particularly when used to model micro-level dynamical

interactions in models of genetic regulation and biochemical
signalling.
An automaton is typically defined as canalizing if there is at least
one state of at least one of its inputs that is sufficient to control the
automaton’s next state (henceforth transition ), regardless of the
states of any other inputs [12]. Clearly, this widely used definition
refers to micro-level characteristics of the components of
multivariate discrete dynamical systems such as automata
networks, and not to canalization as the emergent phenomenon
outlined above. Nonetheless, using this definition, it has been
shown that (1) canalizing functions are widespread in eukaryotic
gene-regulation dynamics [13]; (2) genetic regulatory networksmodelled with canalizing automata are always stable [14,15]; and
(3) realistic biological dynamics are naturally observed in networks
with scale-free connectivity that contain canalizing functions [16].
These observations suggest that the redundancy captured by this
micro-level definition of canalization is a mechanism used to
obtain stability and robustness at the macro-level of phenotypic
traits.
Since the proportion of such ‘strictly’ canalizing functions drops
abruptly with the number of inputs ( k) [17], it was at first assumed
that (micro-level) canalization does not play a prominent role in
stabilizing complex dynamics of gene regulatory networks.
However, when the concept of canalization is extended to include
partially canalizing functions, where subsets of inputs can control the
automaton’s transition, the proportion of available canalizing
automata increases dramatically even for automata with many
inputs [18]. Furthermore, partial canalization has been shown tocontribute to network stability, without a detrimental effect on
‘evolvability’ [18]. Reichhardt and Bassler, point out that, even
though strictly canalizing functions clearly contribute to network
stability, they can also have a detrimental effect on the ability of
networks to adapt to changing conditions [18] – echoing Conrad’s
tradeoff outlined above. This led them to consider the wider class
of partially canalizing functions that confer stable networkdynamics, while improving adaptability. A function of this class
may ignore one or more of its inputs given the states of others, but
is not required to have a single canalizing input. For example, if a
particular input is on, the states of the remaining inputs are
irrelevant, but if that same input is off, then the state of a subset of
its other inputs is required to determine the function’s transition.
In scenarios where two or more inputs are needed to determinethe transition, the needed inputs are said to be collectively canalizing .
Reichhardt and Bassler [18] have shown that the more general
class of partially canalizing functions dominates the space of
Boolean functions for any number of inputs k. Indeed, for any
value of k, there are only two non-canalizing functions that always
depend on the states of all inputs. Other classes of canalizing
functions have been considered, such as nested canalizing functions
[14], Post classes [19] and chain functions [20]. All these classes of
functions characterize situations of input redundancy in automata.
In other words, micro-level canalization is understood as a form of
redundancy, whereby a subset of input states is sufficient to
guarantee transition, and therefore its complement subset of input
states is redundant. This does not mean that redundancy is
necessarily the sole – or even most basic – mechanism to explaincanalization at the macro-level. But the evidence we reviewed
above, at the very least, strongly suggests that micro-level
redundancy is a key mechanism to achieve macro-level canaliza-
tion. Other mechanisms are surely at play, such as the topological
properties of the networks of micro-level interactions. Certainly,
modularity, as suggested by Conrad, plays a role in the robustness
of complex systems and has rightly received much attentionrecently [21]. While we show below that some types of modularitycan derive from micro-level redundancy, other mechanisms to
achieve modularity are well-known [21].
Here, we explore partial canalization, as proposed by Reich-
hardt and Bassler [18], to uncover the loci of control in complexautomata networks, particularly those used as models of geneticregulation and signalling. Moreover, we extend this notion toconsider not only (micro-level) canalization in terms of inputredundancy, but also in terms of input-permutation redundancy toaccount for the situations in which swapping the states of (a subset)of inputs has no effect on an automaton’s transition. From this
point forward, when we use the term canalization we mean it in the
micro-level sense used in the (discrete dynamical systems) literatureto characterize redundancy in automata functions. Nonetheless,we show that the quantification of such micro-level redundancyuncovers important details of macro-level dynamics in automatanetworks used to model biochemical regulation. This allows us tobetter study how robustness and control of phenotypic traits arisesin such systems, thus moving us towards understanding canaliza-tion in the wider sense proposed by Waddington. Beforedescribing our methodology, we introduce necessary conceptsand notations pertaining to Boolean automata and networks, aswell as the segment polarity gene-regulation network in Drosophila
melanogaster , an automata model we use to exemplify our approach.
Boolean Networks
This type of discrete dynamical system was introduced to build
qualitative models of genetic regulation, very amenable to large-scale statistical analysis [22] – see [23] for comprehensive review.ABoolean automaton is a binary variable, x[f0,1g, where state 0 is
interpreted as false (offorunexpressed ), and state 1 as true(onor
expressed ). The states of xare updated in discrete time-steps, t,
according to a Boolean state-transition function ofkinputs:
x
tz1~fit
1,:::,it
k/C0/C1
. Therefore f:f0,1gk?f0,1g. Such a function
can be defined by a Boolean logic formula or by a look-up (truth) table
(LUT) with 2kentries. An example of the former is
xtz1~f(x,y,z)~xt^(yt_zt), or its more convenient shorthand
representation f~x^(y_z), which is a Boolean function of k~3
input binary variables x,y,z, possibly the states of other automata;
^,_and:denote logical conjunction, disjunction, and negation
respectively. The LUT for this function is shown in Figure 1. EachLUT entry of an automaton x,f
a, is defined by (1) a specific
condition , which is a conjunction of kinputs represented as a unique
k-tuple of input-variable (Boolean) states, and (2) the automaton’s
next state (transition) xtz1, given the condition (see Figure 1). We
denote the entire state transition function of an automaton xin its
LUT representation as F:ffa:a~1,:::,2kg.
ABoolean Network (BN) is a graph B:(X,E), where Xis a set of
nBoolean automata nodes xi[X,i~1,:::,n, and Eis a set of
directed edges eji[E:xi,xj[X.I feji[E, it means that automaton
xjis an input to automaton xi, as computed by Fi.
Xi~fxj[X:eji[Egdenotes the set of input automata of xi. Its
cardinality, ki~jXij, is the in-degree of node xi, which determines
the size of its LUT, jFij~2ki. We refer to each entry of Fias
fi:a,a~1:::2ki. The input nodes ofBare nodes whose state does not
depend on the states of other nodes in B. The state of output nodes is
determined by the states of other nodes in the network, but theyare not an input to any other node. Finally, the state of inner nodes
depends on the state of other nodes and affect the state of othernodes in B. At any given time t,Bis in a specific configuration of
node states, x
t~Sx1,x2,:::,xnT. We use the terms state for
individual automata (x)and configuration (x)for the collection of
states of the set of automata of B, i.e. the collective network state.Canalization and Control in Automata Networks

Starting from an initial configuration, x0, a BN updates its
nodes with a synchronous orasynchronous policy. The dynamics ofBis
thus defined by the temporal sequence of configurations thatensue, and there are 2
npossible configurations. The transitions
between configurations can be represented as a state-transition graph ,
STG , where each vertex is a configuration, and each directed edge
denotes a transition from xttoxtz1. The STG of Bthus encodes
the network’s entire dynamical landscape . Under synchronous
updating, configurations that repeat, such that xtzm~xt, are
known as attractors ;fixed point when m~1, and limit cycle – with
period m– when mw1, respectively. The disconnected subgraphs
of a STG leading to an attractor are known as basins of attraction .I n
contrast, under asynchronous updating, there are alternativeconfiguration transitions that depend on the order in which nodesupdate their state. Therefore, the same initial configuration canconverge to distinct attractors with some probability [24,25]. A BNBhas a finite number bof attractors; each denoted by
A
i:i~1,:::,b. When the updating scheme is known, every
configuration xis in the basin of attraction of some specific
attractor Ai. That is, the dynamic trajectory of xconverges to Ai.
We denote such a dynamical trajectory by s(x)
Ai. If the
updating scheme is stochastic, the relationship between configu-rations and attractors can be specified as the conditionalprobability P(A
ijx).
The Segment Polarity Network
The methodology introduced in this paper will be exemplified
using the well-studied Boolean model of the segment polaritynetwork in Drosophila melanogaster [26]. During the early ontogenesis
of the fruit fly, like in every arthropod’s development, there is bodysegmentation [27,28]. The specification of adult cell types in eachof these segments is controlled by a hierarchy of around fortygenes. While the effect of most of the genes in the hierarchy is onlytransient, a subset of segment polarity genes remains expressed during
the life of the fruit fly [29]. The dynamics of the segment polaritynetwork was originally modelled using a system of non-linear
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [30,31]. This model
suggested that the regulatory network of segment polarity genesis a module largely controlled by external inputs that is robust tochanges to its internal kinetic parameters. On that basis, Albertand Othmer later proposed a simpler discrete BN model of the
dynamics of the segment polarity network (henceforth SPN) [26]. This
was the first Boolean model of gene regulation capable of
predicting the steady state patterns experimentally observed inwild-type and mutant embryonic development with significantaccuracy, and has thus become the quintessential example of thepower of the logical approach to modelling of biochemicalregulation from qualitative data in the literature. Modelling withODEs, in contrast, is hindered by the need of substantial
quantitative data for parameter estimation [32–37].
The SPN model comprises fifteen nodes that represent intra-
cellular chemical species and the genes engrailed (en) ;wingless (wg) ;
hedgehog (hh) ;patched (ptc) and cubitus interruptus (ci) [29–31]. These
genes encode a number of proteins such as the transcription
factors Engrailed (EN), Cubitus Interruptus (CI), CI Activator
(CIA), and CI repressor (CIR); the secreted proteins Wingless(WG) and Hedgehog (HH); and the transmembrane proteinPatched (PTC). Other proteins included in the SPN model areSloppy-Paired (SLP) – the state of which is previously determinedby the pair-rule gene family that stabilizes its expression before the
segment polarity genes – as well as Smoothened (SMO) and the
PH complex that forms when HH from neighbouring cells binds
to PTC. Figure 2 shows the topology and Table 1 lists the logicalrules of the nodes in every cell of the SPN. This model consists of aspatial arrangement of four interconnected cells, a parasegment .
While the regulatory interactions within each cell are governed bythe same network, inter-cellular signalling affects neighbouringcells. That is, regulatory interactions in a given cell depend on the
states of WG, hhand HH in adjacent cells. Therefore, six
additional (inter-cellular) ‘spatial signals’ are included: hh
i+1,
HH i+1andWG i+1, where i~1,:::,4is the cell index in the four-
cell parasegment. In a parasegment, the cell with index i~1
corresponds to its anterior cell and the cell with index i~4to its
posterior cell (see Figure 3). In simulations, the four-cellparasegments assume periodic boundary conditions (i.e. anterior
and posterior cells are adjacent to each other). Since each
parasegment has 4|15~60nodes, four of which are in a fixed
state (SLP), there are 2
56possible configurations – a dynamical
landscape too large for exhaustive analysis. Even though theoriginal model was not fully synchronous because PHandSMO
were updated instantaneously at time t, rather than at tz1, here
we use the fully equivalent, synchronous version. Specifically, since
PH is an output node, synchronizing its transition with the
remaining nodes at tz1does not impact the model’s dynamics.
The state of SMO influences the updating of CIA andCIR; but
since the update of SMO is instantaneous, we can include its state-
transition function in the state-transition functions of CIA and
CIR (which update at tz1) with no change in the dynamics of the
model as described in [38].
The initial configuration (IC) of the SPN, depicted in Figure 3,
and which leads to the wild-type expression pattern is known [26]:wg
4~en1~hh1~ptc2,3,4~ci2,3,4~1(onor expressed). The re-
maining nodes in every cell of the parasegment are set to 0 ( off,o r
not expressed). Overall, the dynamics of the SPN settles to one often attractors – usually divided into four qualitatively distinctgroups, see Figure 4: (1) wild-type with three extra variations (PTCmutant, double wgbands, double wgbands PTC mutant); (2)
Broad-stripe mutant; (3) No segmentation; and (4) Ectopic (with
the same variations as wild-type). Albert and Othmer estimatedthat the number of configurations that converge to the wild-type
attractor is approximately 6|10
11– a very small portion of the
total number of possible configurations ( &7|1016) – and that the
broad-stripe mutant attractor basin contains about 90% of all
possible configurations [26].

The inner and output nodes of each cell in a parasegment – that
is, every node except the input node SLP – that has reached astable configuration (attractor) are always in one of the followingfive patterns.

For example, the wild-type configuration corresponds – from
anterior to posterior cell – to the patterns I3,I2,I1andI5. Thus
the pattern I4is only seen in mutant expression patterns. The
patterns I1toI5can be seen as attractors of the inner- and
output-node dynamics of each cell in a parasegment.
Besides the fact that the SPN is probably the most well-known
discrete dynamical system model of biochemical regulation, we
chose it to exemplify our methodology because (1) it has been well-
validated experimentally, despite the assumption that genes andproteins operate like on/off switches with synchronous transitions
and (2) the model includes both intra-cellular regulation and inter-
cellular signalling in a spatial array of cells. The intra and inter-cellular interactions in the SPN model result in a dynamical
landscape that is too large to characterize via an STG, while
adding also an extra level of inter-cellular (spatial) regulation. Theability to deal with such multi-level complexity makes our
methodology particularly useful. As we show below, we can
uncover the signals that control collective information processingin such (spatial and non-spatial) complex dynamics.
Methodology and Results
Micro-level Canalization via Schemata
In previous work, we used schema redescription to demonstrate that
we can understand more about the dynamical behaviour of
automata networks by analysing the patterns of redundancy present
in their (automata) components (micro-level), rather than lookingsolely at their macro-level or collective behaviour [39]. Here we
relate the redundancy removed via schema redescription with the
concept of canalization , and demonstrate that a characterization of
the full canalization present in biochemical networks leads to a
better understanding of how cells and collections of cells‘compute’. Moreover, we show that this leads to a comprehensive
characterization of control in automata models of biochemicalregulation. Let us start by describing the schema redescription
methodology. Since a significant number of new concepts andnotations are introduced in this, and subsequent sections, asuccinct glossary of terms as well as a table with the mathematicalnotations used is available in Data S1.
From the extended view of canalization introduced earlier, it
follows that the inputs of a given Boolean automaton do notcontrol its transitions equally. Indeed, substantial redundancy instate-transition functions is expected. Therefore, filtering redun-dancy out is equivalent to identifying the loci of control inautomata. In this section we focus on identifying the loci of controlin individual automata by characterizing the canalization presentin their transition functions. First, we consider how subsets ofinputs in specific state combinations make other inputs redundant .
Then we propose an additional form of canalization that accountsforinput permutations that leave a transition unchanged. Later, we
use this characterization of canalization and control in individualautomata to study networks of automata; this also allows us toanalyse robustness and collective computation in these networks.
Wildcard schemata and enputs .Consider the example
automaton xin Figure 5A, where the entire subset of LUT entries
inFwith transitions to onis depicted. This portion of entries in F
can be redescribed as a set of wildcard schemata ,F’:ff’ug. A wildcard
schema f’uis exactly like a LUT entry, but allows an additional
wildcard symbol, #(also represented graphically in grey), to appear
in its condition (see Figure 5B). A wildcard input means that itaccepts any state, leaving the transition unchanged . In other words,
wildcard inputs are redundant given the non-wildcard input states
specified in a schema f’
u. More formally, when the truth value of
an input Boolean variable iin a schema f’uis defined by the third
(wildcard) symbol, it is equivalent to stating that the truth value ofautomaton xis unaffected by the truth value of igiven the
conditions defined by f’

Wildcard schemata are minimal in the sense that none of the

schema is unique in the sense that the subset of LUT entries it

U1:ff1,f5,f9,f13g and U9:ff4,f5,f6,f7g, therefore
U1\U9:ff5g. The set of wildcard schemata F’is also complete .
This means that for a given LUT Fthere is one and only one set
F’that contains all possible minimal and unique wildcard
schemata. Since wildcard schemata are minimal, unique and they
form a complete setF’, they are equivalent to the set of all prime
implicants obtained during the first step of the Quine & McCluskey
Boolean minimization algorithm [40]. Typically, prime implicantsare computed for the fraction of the LUT that specifies transitions

toon. Then a subset of the so-called essential prime implicants is
identified. The set of essential prime implicants is the subset ofprime implicants sufficient to describe (cover) every entry in theinput set of LUT entries. However, to study how to control thetransitions of automata we use the set of all prime implicants, sinceit encodes every possible way a transition can take place. The setF’may also contain any original entry in Fthat could not be
subsumed by a wildcard schema. Although the upper bound on
the size of F’is known to be O(3
k=ﬃﬃﬃ
kp
)[41], the more input
redundancy there is, the smaller the cardinality of F’.
The condition of a wildcard schema can always be expressed as
a logical conjunction of literals (logical variables or their negation),which correspond to its non-wildcard inputs. Since a wildcardschema is a prime implicant , it follows that every literal is essential to
determine the automaton’s transition. Therefore, we refer to theliterals in a schema as its essential input states ,o r enputs for short. To
summarize, each enput in a schema is essential, and theconjunction of its enputs is a sufficient condition to control the
automaton’s transition. It also follows that the set F’of wildcard
schemata can be expressed as a disjunctive normal form (DNF) – that
is, a disjunction of conjunctions that specifies the list of sufficientconditions to control automaton x, where each disjunction clause
is a schema. The DNF comprising all the prime implicants of aBoolean function fis known as its Blake’s canonical form [42]. The
canonical form of falways preserves the input-output relationships
specified by its LUT F. Therefore, the basic laws of Boolean logic
– contradiction, excluded middle and de Morgan’s laws – arepreserved by the schema redescription.
Schema redescription is related to the work of John Holland on
condition/action rules to model inductive reasoning in cognitive
systems [43] and to the general RR framework proposed by Annette

position-free symbol does not require an index. Although this figure depicts only the schemata obtained for the subset of LUT entries of xthat
transition to on, entries that do not match any of these schemata transition to off(since xis a Boolean automaton).

Karmiloff-Smith to explain the emergence of internal representa-
tions and external notations in human cognition [44]. Ourmethodology to remove redundancy from automata LUTs also
bears similarities with the more general mask analysis developed by
George Klir in his ‘reconstructability’ analysis, which is applicableto any type of variable [45]. In addition, prime implicants have
been known and used for the minimization of circuits in electrical
engineering since the notion was introduced by Quine &McCluskey [40]; similar ideas were also used by Valiant [46]when introducing Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning.
Two-symbol schemata. We now introduce a different and
complementary form of redundancy in automata, which weconsider another form of canalization. Wildcard schemata identify
input states that are sufficient for controlling an automaton’s
transition (enputs). Now we identify subsets of inputs that can bepermuted in a schema without effect on the transition it defines
[39]. For this, a further redescription process takes as input the set
of wildcard schemata ( F’)o fxto compute a set of two-symbol
schemata F’’:ff’’
hg(see Figure 5C). The additional position-free
symbol (0
m) above inputs in the condition of a schema f’’means that
any subset of inputs thus marked can ‘switch places’ without affecting the
automaton’s transition. The index of the position-free symbol, when
necessary, is used to differentiate among distinct subsets of‘permutable’ inputs. A two-symbol schema f’’
hredescribes a set
Hh:ffa:faf00
hgof LUT entries of x; it also redescribes a subset
H’h(F’of wildcard schemata.
A two-symbol schema f’’hcaptures permutation redundancy in a set
of wildcard schemata H’h. More specifically, it identifies subsets of
input states whose permutations do not affect the truth value of the
condition, leaving the automaton’s transition unchanged. In grouptheory, a permutation is defined as a bijective mapping of a non-
empty set onto itself; a permutation group is any set of
permutations of a set. Permutation groups that consist of all
possible permutations of a set are known as symmetric groups under
permutation [47]. For Boolean functions in general, the study of
permutation/symmetric groups dates back to Shannon [48] andMcCluskey [49] (see also [50]).
Two-symbol schemata identify subsets of wildcard schemata
that form symmetric groups. We refer to each such subset of inputstates that can permute in a two-symbol schema – those marked
with the same position-free symbol – as a group-invariant enput . Note
that a group-invariant enput may include wildcard symbolsmarked with a position-free symbol. More formally, a two-symbol
schema f’’can be expressed as a logical conjunction of enputs –
literal or group-invariant. Let us denote the set of literal enputs onthe condition of f’’byX
‘(X– the non-wildcard inputs not
marked with the position-free symbol. For simplicity, n‘~X‘jj.
A group-invariant enput gis defined by (1) a subset of input

the quantities n0
g,n1
gandn#
gare positive for any group-invariant
enput g. We can think of these two required positive quantities as
subconstraints ; in particular, we define a group-invariant enput by
the two subconstraints n0
g,n1
g, since n#
gis always derivable from
those two given the expression for the overall permutation
constraint. This precludes the trivial case of subsets of inputs inthe same state from being considered a valid group-invariant
enput – even though they can permute leaving the transition
unchanged. A two-symbol schema f’’hasn
‘literal enputs and g
group-invariant enputs; each of the latter type of enputs is definedby a distinct permutation constraint for g~1,:::,g. An input
variable whose truth value is the wildcard symbol in a givenschema is never a literal enput (it is not essential by definition).However, it can be part of a group-invariant enput, if it is markedwith a position-free symbol. Further details concerning thecomputation of wildcard and two-symbol schemata are availablein Data S2.
In our working example, the resulting two-symbol schema (see
Figure 5C) contains n
‘~2literal inputs: X‘~fi2~0,i3~1g.I t
also contains one ( g~1) group-invariant enput Xg~fi1,i4,i5,i6g

scription reveals that the automaton’s transition to onis
determined only by a subset of its six inputs: as long as inputs 2
and 3 are off and on, respectively, and among the others at least one is on andanother is off, the automaton will transition to on . These minimal control
constraints are not obvious in the original LUT and are visibleonly after redescription.
We equate canalization with redundancy. The more redundancy
exists in the LUT of automaton x, as input-irrelevance or input-
symmetry (group-invariance), the more canalizing it is, and themore compact its two-symbol redescription is, thus jF’’jvjFj.I n
other words – after redescription – input and input-symmetryredundancy in Fis removed in the form of the two symbols. The
input states that remain are essential to determine the automaton’stransition. Below we quantify these two types of redundancy,leading to two new measures of canalization. Towards that, wemust first clearly separate the two forms of redundancy that existin 2-symbol schemata. The condition of a two-symbol schema f’’
with a single group-invariant enput g– such as the one in
Figure 5C – can be expressed as:
^
ij[X0
‘:ij^
ij[X1

where X0
‘is the set of literal enputs that must be off, and X1
‘is the
set of literal enputs that must be on(thus X‘~X1
‘|X0
‘). This
expression separates the contributions (as conjunctions) of the
literal enputs, and each subconstraint of a group-invariant enput.Since we found no automaton in the target model (see below) withschemata containing more than one group-invariant enput, forsimplicity and without lack of generality, we present here only thiscase ( g~1). See Data S3 for the general expression that accounts
for multiple group-invariant enputs ( gw1).
All possible transitions of xtoonare described by a set F
1’’of
two-symbol schemata. This set can also be expressed in a DNF,where each disjunction clause is given by Expression 1 for allschemata f’’[F
1’’:Transitions to offare defined by the negation of
such DNF expression: F0’’::f’’,Vf’’[F1’’ fg . Canalization of an
automaton xis now characterized in terms of two-symbol
schemata that capture two forms of redundancy: (1) input-irrelevance
and (2) input-symmetry (group-invariance). We next describe the
procedure to compute 2-symbol schemata for a an automaton x.
Readers not interested in the algorithmic details of this compu-tation can safely move to the next subsection.
The procedure starts with the set of wildcard schemata F’
obtained via the first step of the Quine & McCluskey algorithm[40] (see above). The set F’is then partitioned into subsets H’
i
such that,
F’~[
iH’i:Canalization and Control in Automata Networks

where each H’icontains every schema x’[F’with equal number of
zeroes ( n0), ones ( n1), and wildcards ( n#), with n0zn1zn#~k.I n
other words, the H’iare equivalence classes induced on F’byn0,
n1, and n#. This is a necessary condition for a set of wildcard
schemata to form a symmetric group. The algorithm then iterates
on each H’i, checking if it contains a symmetric group; i.e. if it
contains wildcard schemata with all the permutations of the largest
set of inputs variables possible. If it does, it marks those input
variables as a group-invariant enput in H’iand moves to another
subset H’j. If it does not, then it checks for symmetric groups in
smaller sets of input variables within each set H’i. It does this by
iteratively expanding the search space to include all subsets of H’i
with cardinality jH’ij{1. The procedure is repeated, if no
symmetric groups are found, until the subsets contain only onewildcard schema.
Although several heuristics are implemented to prune the search
space, the algorithm is often not suitable for exhaustively searchingsymmetric groups in large sets of schemata. However, the
individual automata found in models of biochemical regulation
and signalling networks typically have a fairly low number ofinputs. Therefore, schema redescription of their LUT leads to
manageable sets of wildcard schemata, which can be exhaustively
searched for symmetric groups. Indeed, as shown below, allautomata in the SPN model have been exhaustively redescribed
into two-symbol schemata. For additional details on the compu-
tation of schemata see Data S2 .
Quantifying Canalization: Effective Connectivity and
Input Symmetry
Schemata uncover the ‘control logic’ of automata by making the
smallest input combinations that are necessary and sufficient todetermine transitions explicit. We equate canalization with the
redundancy present in this control logic: the smaller is the set of
inputs needed to control an automaton, the more redundancyexists in its LUT and the more canalizing it is. This first type of
canalization is quantified by computing the mean number of
unnecessary inputs of automaton x, which we refer to as input
redundancy . An upper bound is given by,
kr(x)~P
fa[Fmax
h:fa[Hhn#
h/C16/C17
jFjð2Þ
and a lower bound is given by:
kr(x)~P
fa[Fmin
h:fa[Hhn#
h/C16/C17
jFjð3Þ
These expressions compute a mean number of irrelevant inputs
associated with the entries of the LUT F. The number of
irrelevant inputs in a schema f’’his the number of its wildcards n#
h.
Because each entry faofFis redescribed by one or more schemata
f’’h, there are various ways to compute a characteristic number of
irrelevant inputs associated with the entry, which is nonetheless
bounded by the maximum and minimum number of wildcards inthe set of schemata that redescribe f
a. Therefore, the expressions
above identify all schemata f’’hwhose set of redescribed entries Hh
includes fa. The upper (lower) bound of input redundancy,
Equation 2 (Equation 3), corresponds to considering the maximum(minimum) number of irrelevant inputs found for all schemata f’’
hthat redescribe entry faof the LUT – an optimist (pessimist)
quantification of this type of canalization. Notice that inputredundancy is not an estimated value. Also, it weights equally eachentry of the LUT, which is the same as assuming that everyautomaton input is equally likely.
Here we use solely the upper bound, which we refer to
henceforth simply as input redundancy with the notation k
r(x). This
means that we assume that the most redundant schemata arealways accessible for control of the automaton. We will exploreelsewhere the range between the bounds, especially in regards to
predicting the dynamical behaviour of BNs. The range for input
redundancy is 0ƒk
r(x)ƒk, where kis the number of inputs of x.
When kr(x)~kwe have full input irrelevance, or maximum
canalization, which occurs only in the case of frozen-stateautomata. If k
r(x)~0, the state of every input is always needed
to determine the transition and we have no canalization in termsof input redundancy.
In the context of a BN, if some inputs of a node xare irrelevant
from a control logic perspective, then its effective set of inputs is
smaller than its in-degree k. We can thus infer more about
effective control in a BN than what is apparent from looking atstructure alone (see analysis of macro-level control below). A veryintuitive way to quantify such effective control, is by computing themean number of inputs needed to determine the transitions of x,
which we refer to as its effective connectivity :
k
e(x)~k(x){kr(x) ð4Þ
whose range is 0ƒke(x)ƒk. In this case, ke(x)~0means full
input irrelevance, or maximum canalization, and kr(x)~k, means
no canalization.
The type of canalization quantified by the input redundancy
and effective connectivity measures does not include the form ofpermutation redundancy entailed by group-invariant enputs. Yetthis is a genuine form of redundancy involved in canalization, as inthe case of nested canalization [14], since it corresponds to thecase in which different inputs can be alternatively canalizing. The
two-symbol schema redescription allows us to measure this form ofredundancy by computing the mean number of inputs thatparticipate in group-invariant enputs, easily tallied by theoccurrence of the position-free symbol (
0) in schemata. Thus we
define a measure of input symmetry for an automaton x, whose
upper-bound is given by
ks(x)~P
fa[Fmax
h:fa[Hhn0
h/C0/C1
jFjð5Þ
and a lower-bound by,
ks(x)~P
fa[Fmin
h:fa[Hhn0
h/C0/C1
jFjð6Þ
where n0
his the number of position-free symbols in schema f’’h.
The upper bound of input symmetry (Equation 5) corresponds
to considering an optimist quantification of this type of canaliza-tion. Here we use solely the upper bound, which we refer tohenceforth simply as input symmetry and denote by k
s(x). Again,
the assumption is that the most redundant schemata are alwaysaccessible for control of the automaton. The range for inputsymmetry is 0ƒk
s(x)ƒk. High (low) values mean that permuta-Canalization and Control in Automata Networks

tions of input states are likely (unlikely) to leave the transition
unchanged.
Canalization in automata LUTs – the micro-level of networks of
automata – is then quantified by two types of redundancy: input
redundancy using kr(x)and input symmetry withks(x). To be able to
compare the canalization in automata with distinct numbers of
inputs, we can compute relative measures of canalization:
k/C3
r(x)~kr(x)
k(x);k/C3
s(x)~ks(x)
k(x)ð7Þ
the range of which is ½0,1/C138:Automata transition functions can have
different amounts of each form of canalization, which allows us to
consider four broad canalization classes for automata: class A with
highkr(x)and high ks(x),class B with high kr(x)and low ks(x),
class C with low kr(x)and high ks(x), and class D with low kr(x)
and low ks(x). We will explore these classes in more detail
elsewhere. Below, these measures are used to analyse micro-level
canalization in the SPN model and discuss the type of functions
encountered. Before that, let us introduce an alternative repre-
sentation of the canalized control logic of automata, which allows
us to compute network dynamics directly from the parsimonious
information provided by schemata.
Network Representation of a Schema
Canalization in an automaton, captured by a set of schemata,
can also be conveniently represented as a McCulloch & Pitts
threshold network – introduced in the 1940s to study computation
in interconnected simple logical units [51]. These networks consist
of binary units that can transition from quiescent to firing upon
reaching an activity threshold (t)of the firing of input units. To
use this type of network to represent two-symbol schemata we
resort to two types of units. One is the state unit (s-unit), which
represents an input variable in a specific Boolean state; the other is
thethreshold unit (t-unit) that implements the condition that causes
the automaton to transition. Two s-units are always used to
represent the (Boolean) states of any input variable that
participates as enput in the condition of an automaton x: one
fires when the variable is onand the other when it is off. To avoid
contradiction, the two s-units for a given variable cannot fire
simultaneously. Directed fibres link (source) units to (end) units,
propagating a pulse – when the source unit is firing – that
contributes to the firing of the end unit. The simultaneous firing of
at least t(threshold) incoming s-units into a t-unit, causes the latter
to fire.
In the example automaton in Figure 5, the set of schemata F’’
contains only one schema. This schema can be directly converted
to a (2-layer) McCulloch & Pitts network. This conversion, which
is possible due to the separation of subconstraints given by
Expression (1), is shown in Figure 6 and explained in its caption.
Note that in the McCulloch & Pitts representation, the transition
of the automaton is determined in two steps. First, a layer of
threshold units is used to check that the literal and group-invariant
constraints are satisfied; then, a second layer – containing just one
threshold unit – fires when every subconstraint in Expression (1)
has been simultaneously satisfied, determining the transition. This
means that in this network representation each schema with literal
enputs and at least a group-invariant enput requires two layers and
three t-units. Since in McCulloch & Pitts networks each thresholdunit has a standard delay of one time step, this network
representation of a schema takes two time steps to compute its
transition. We introduce an alternative threshold network
representation of a two-symbol schema f’’that only requires a
single t-unit and takes a single time delay to compute a transition.We refer to this variant as the Canalizing Map of a schema or CM
for short. A CM is essentially the same as a McCulloch and Pitts
network, with the following provisos concerning the ways in which
s-units and t-units can be connected:
1. Only one fibre originates from each s-unit that can participate
as enput in f’’and it must always end in the t-unit used to
encode f’’.
2. The fibre that goes from a s-unit to the t-unit can branch out into
several fibre endings. This means that if the s-unit is firing, a
pulse propagates through its outgoing fibre and through its
branches. Branching fibres are used to capture group-invariant
enputs, as we explain later.
3. Branches from distinct s-units can fusetogether into a single
fibre ending – the fused fibre increases the end t-unit’s firing
activity by one if at least one of the fused fibres has a pulse.
4. A fibre that originates in a t-unit encoding a schema f’’must
end in a s-unit that corresponds to the automaton transition
defined by f’’.
Figure 7 depicts the elements of a single schema’s CM. Table 2
summarizes the rules that apply to the interconnections between
units. Transitions in CMs occur in the same way as in standard
McCulloch & Pitts networks. Once sufficient conditions for a
transition are observed at some time t, the transition occurs at
tz1. The firing (or not) of t-units is thus assumed to have a
standard delay (one time-step), identical for all t-units. Note that in
CMs, s-units can be regarded as a special type of t-unit with
threshold t~1that send a pulse through their outgoing fibres
instantaneously. Next we describe the algorithm to obtain the CM
representation of a schema. Readers not interested in the
algorithmic details of this computation can safely bypass the next

schema. Given a 2-symbol schema f’’, there are two steps
involved in producing its CM representation. The first is
connecting s-units to the t-unit for f’’in such a way that it fires,
if and only if, the constraints of f’’– defined by Expression (1) –
are satisfied. The second step is determining the appropriate firing
threshold tfor the t-unit. If the schema does not have group-
invariant enputs, the conversion is direct as for the standard
McCulloch & Pitts network – see Figure 6: The s-units
corresponding to literal enputs ij[X‘are linked to the t-unit using
a single fibre from each s-unit to the t-unit, which has a threshold
t~n‘. If the schema has a group-invariant enput, its subcon-
straints are implemented by branching and fusing fibres connect-
ing the s-units and the t-unit. In cases such as our example
automaton x(Figures 5 and 6) where the subconstraints
n0
g~n1
g~1, the solution is still simple. To account for subcon-
straint n0
g, it is sufficient to take an outgoing fibre from each of the
s-units ij[Xg:ij~0and fuse them into a single fibre ending.
Therefore, if at least one of these s-units is firing, the fused fibre
ending transmits a single pulse to the t-unit, signalling that the
subconstraint has been satisfied. Increasing the t-unit’s threshold
by one makes the t-unit respond to this signal appropriately. The
same applies for subconstraint n1
g, using a similar wiring for s-units
ij[Xg:ij~1. The final threshold for the t-unit that captures the
example schema of Figure 5 is thus t~n‘zn0

as shown in Figure 8C.
The case of general group-invariant constraints is more
intricate. Every literal enput ij[X‘is linked to the t-unit via a
single fibre exactly as above. Afterwards, the subconstraints n0

consecutively. Note that for every input variable ijin the set Xgof
symmetric input variables, there are two s-units: one representing
ijin state 0and another in state 1. To account for subconstraint n0

The canalizing map of an automaton. The algorithm to
convert a single schema f’’to a CM is subsequently used to
produce the CM of an entire Boolean automaton xas follows:
Each schema f’’[F’’is converted to its CM representation. Each
state of an input variable is represented by a single s-unit in theresulting threshold network. In other words, there is a maximumof two s-units (one for state 0and one for state 1) for each input
variable that is either a literal enput or participates in a group-invariant enput of x. The resulting threshold network is the
canalizing map of x. The connectivity rules of automata CMs
include the following provisos:
1. Every s-unit can be connected to a single t-unit with a single
outgoing fibre, which can be single or have branches.
2. Therefore, the number of outgoing fibres coming out of a s-unit
(before any branching) corresponds to the number of schemataf’’[F’’in which the respective variable-state participates as an
enput. If such a variable is included in a group-invariant enput,then the fibre may have branches.
3. Any subset set of t-units with threshold t~1for the same
automaton transition ( x~0orx~1) are merged into a single t-
Figure 6. McCulloch & Pitts representation of Expression (1).
The conjunction clauses in Expression (1) for the example automaton x
are directly mapped onto a standard McCulloch & Pitts network withtwo layers. On one layer the two literal enputs are accounted for by athreshold unit (at the top) with threshold t~n
‘~2. There is also a
group-invariant enput with permutation subconstraints on both
Boolean states. Two threshold units on the same layer are used tocapture these. The threshold unit on the left accounts for the
permutation subconstraint n
1
g~1. It thus has as incoming s-units the
inputs xi[Xg:xi~1and threshold t~n1
g~1. In a similar way, the
threshold unit on the right accounts for the subconstraint n0
g~1. When
all the constraints (literal and group-invariant) are satisfied, the last
threshold unit (second layer) ‘fires’ causing the transition to on.

for a generic state). The t-unit (schema) is represented using a largercircle. One of its halves is coloured, and the other labelled with the t-
unit’s threshold t. Fibres can be single, or branched. In this example
there are branching fibres only, where fibre fusions represent allpossible combinations of two out of the three s-units.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0055946.g007Canalization and Control in Automata Networks

unit (also with t~1), which receives all incoming fibres of the
original t-units. In such scenario, any fused branches can alsobe de-fused into single fibres. Note that this situationcorresponds to schemata that exhibit nested canalization,where one of several inputs settles the transition, but which donot form a symmetric group.
The CM of xcan be constructed from the subset of schemata
F
1’’(the conditions to on), orF0’’(the conditions to off). When the
conditions are not met for convergence to on, one is guaranteed
convergence to off(and vice-versa). However, since we are
interested in exploring scenarios with incomplete informationabout the states of variables in networks of automata rather than asingle automaton (see below), we construct the CM of a Boolean
automaton xincluding all conditions, that is using F’’:F
1’’|F0’’.
This facilitates the analysis of transition dynamics where automata
in a network can transition to either state. Figure 10 depicts thecomplete CM of the example automaton xdescribed in Figure 5–
now including also its transitions to off.
By uncovering the enputs of an automaton, we gain the ability
to compute its transition with incomplete information about the state of
every one of its inputs. For instance, the possible transitions of theautomaton in Figure 5 are fully described by the CM (andschemata) in Figure 10; as shown, transitions can be determinedfrom a significantly small subset of the input variables in specific
state combinations. For instance, it is sufficient to observe i
3~0to
know that automaton xtransitions to off.I fxwas used to model
the interactions that lead a gene to be expressed or not, it is easy tosee that to down-regulate its expression, it is sufficient to ensurethat the regulator i
3is not expressed. This is the essence of
canalization: the transition of an automaton is controlled by a
small subset of input states. In the macro-level canalization section
below, we use the CM’s ability to compute automata transitionswith incomplete information to construct an alternative portrait ofnetwork dynamics, which we use in lieu of the original BN to studycollective dynamics. Let us first apply our micro-level methodologyto the SPN model.
Micro-level Canalization in the SPN Model
The automata in the SPN fall in two categories: those that have
a single input ( k~1), the analysis of which is trivial, namely, SLP,
WG, EN, HH, ciand CI, and those with kw1. The two-symbol
schemata and canalization measures for each automaton in theSPN model are depicted in Figure 11; Figure 12 maps theautomata to their canalization classes. Schemata easily display all
the sufficient combinations of input states (enputs) to control the
transitions of the automata in this model, which represent theinhibition or expression of genes and proteins. Indeed, theresulting list of schemata allows analysts to quickly infer howcontrol operates in each node of the network. Wildcard symbols(depicted in Figure 11 as grey boxes) denote redundant inputs.
Position-free symbols (depicted in Figure 11 as circles), denote‘functionally equivalent’ inputs; that is, sets of inputs that can be
alternatively used to ensure the same transition. For example, for
wgto be expressed, SLP, the previous state of wg(reinforcing
feedback loop) and CIA can be said to be ‘functionally equivalent’,since any two of these three need to be expressed for wgto be
expressed. The several schemata that are listed for the expressionor inhibition of a specific node (genes and gene products), giveexperts alternative ‘recipes’ available to control the node according
to the model – and which can be experimentally tested and
validated. Let us now present some relevant observationsconcerning micro-level canalization in the SPN model:
1. The inhibition of wgcan be attained in one of two ways: either
two of the first three inputs (SLP, wg,C I A )a r e off
(unexpressed), or CIR is on(expressed). The expression of wg
– essential in the posterior cell of a parasegment to attain thewild-type expression pattern (Figure 3)– is attained in just one
way: CIR must be off(unexpressed), and two of the other three
inputs (SLP, wg, CIA) must be on(expressed). Note the
simplicity of this control logic vis a vis the 2
4~16possible
distinct ways to control wgspecified by its LUT, given that it is
a function of 4 inputs. This control logic is also not obviousfrom the Boolean logic expression of node wg, as shown in
Table 1; at the very least, the schemata obtained for wg
provide a more intuitive representation of control than the
logical expression. Moreover, schema redescription, unlike the
logical expression, allows us to directly quantify canalization.The control logic of this gene shows fairly high degree of bothtypes of canalization: even though there are k~4inputs, on
average, only k
e~1:75inputs are needed to control the
transition, and ks~2:25inputs can permute without effect on
the transition (see Figures 11 and 12); wgis thus modelled by
an automaton of class A.
2. The inhibition of CIR can be attained in one of two simple,
highly canalized, ways: either one of its first two inputs (PTC,CI) is off(unexpressed), or one of its four remaining inputs ( hh
andHH in neighbouring cells) is on(expressed); all other
inputs can be in any other state. The expression of CIR can beattained in only one specific, non-canalized, way: the first twoinputs must be on(expressed), and the remaining four inputs
must be off(unexpressed) – a similar expression behaviour is
found for hhandptc. Note the simplicity of this control logic
vis a vis the 2
6~64possible distinct ways to control CIR
specified by its LUT, given that it is a function of 6inputs.
While, in this case, the control logic is also pretty clear from
the original Boolean logic expression of node CIR (in Table 1),the schemata obtained for CIR provide a more intuitiverepresentation of control and allows us to directly quantifycanalization. CIR is a protein with a very high degree of bothtypes of canalization: even though there are k~6inputs, on
average, only k
e~1:08inputs are needed to control the
transition, and ks~5:25inputs can permute without effect onTable 2. Connectivity rules in canalizing maps.

the transition (see Figures 11 and 12). This high degree of
both types of canalization, which is not quantifiable directlyfrom the logical expression or the LUT, is notable inFigure 12, where CIR emerges very clearly as an automaton
of class A.
3. The control logic of CIA entails high canalization of the input
redundancy kind. For instance, its inhibition can be achievedby a single one of its six inputs (CI off) and its expression by two
inputs only (PTC offand CI on). On the other hand, there is low
canalization of the input symmetry kind, therefore CIA ismodelled by an automaton in class B.
4. The expression of en– essential in the anterior cell of a
parasegment to achieve the wild-type phenotype – depends onthe inhibition of (input node) SLP in the same cell, and on theexpression of the wingless protein in at least one neighbouringcell.

5. Most automata in the model fall into canalization class B
described above. CIR and wgdiscussed above display greatest
input symmetry, and fall in class A (see Figure 12).
6. Looking at all the schemata obtained in Figure 11, we notice a
consistent pattern for all spatial signals, hhi+1,H H i+1and
WG i+1. Whenever they are needed to control a transition
(when they are enputs in the schemata of other nodes), eitherthey are offin both neighbouring cells, or they are onin at least
one of the neighbouring cells. For instance, for a given cell i,
HH in neighbouring cells is only relevant if it is unexpressed inboth cells ( HH
i+1~0), or if it is expressed in at least one of
them ( HH i{1~1_HH iz1~1). This means that the six nodes
corresponding to spatial signals affecting a cell in a paraseg-ment can be consolidated into just three neighbour nodes , a similar
consolidation of spatial signals was used previously byWilladsen & Wiles [52] to simplify the spatial model into asingle-cell non-spatial model. In what follows, we refer to thesespatial signals simply as nhh, nHH and nWG. If such a node is
offit means that the corresponding original nodes are offin both
adjacent cells; if it is onit means that at least one of the
corresponding original nodes in an adjacent cell is on.
7. Only PTC and wghave feedback loops that are active after
schema redescription, both for their inhibition and expression;these are self-reinforcing, but also depend on other enputs (seealso Figures 13 and 14).Because this is a relatively simple model, some of the
observations about control, especially for nodes with fewer inputs,
could be made simply by looking at the original transitionfunctions in Table 1, since they are available as very simple logicalexpressions – this is the case of CIR, but certainly not wgabove.
However, the quantification of canalization requires the additional
symbols used in schema redescription to identify redundancy,which are not available in the original automata logicalexpressions or their LUTs. Moreover, the transition functions of
automata in larger Boolean models of genetic regulation and
signalling are rarely available as simple logical expressions, andnodes can be regulated by a large number of other nodes, thusmaking such direct comprehension of control-logic difficult. Incontrast, since redescription uncovers canalization in the form of
input redundancy and symmetry, the more canalization exists, the
more redundancy is removed and the simpler will be the schematarepresentation of the logic of an automaton. This makes canalizingmaps (CM) particularly useful, since they can be used to visualize
and compute the minimal control logic of automata. The CMs
that result from converting the schemata of each node in the SPNto a threshold-network representation are shown in Figure 13 andFigure 14. For a biochemical network of interest, such as the SPN
or much larger networks, domain experts (e.g. biomedical
scientists and systems and computational biologists) can easilyascertain the control logic of each component of their model fromthe schemata or the corresponding CMs.
In summary, there are several important benefits of schema
redescription of Boolean automata vis a vis the original Booleanlogic expression or the LUT of an automaton: (1) a parsimonious
and intuitive representation of the control logic of automata, since
redundancy is clearly identified in the form of the two additional
symbols, which gives us (2) the ability to quantify all forms of
canalization in the straightforward manner described above;
finally, as we elaborate next, the integration of the schema
redescription (or CMs) of individual automata in a network (micro-level) allows us to (3) characterize macro-level dynamics parsimoniously,
uncovering minimal control patterns, robustness and the modules
responsible for collective computation in these networks.
Macro-level Canalization and Control in Automata
Networks
After removing redundancy from individual automata LUTs in
networks (micro-level), it becomes possible to integrate theircanalizing logic to understand control and collective dynamics ofautomata networks (macro-level). In other words, it becomesfeasible to understand how biochemical networks process infor-
mation collectively – their emergent or collective computation
[39,53–56].
Dynamics canalization map and dynamical
modularity. The CMs obtained for each automaton of a BN,
such as the SPN model (see Figures 13 and 14), can be integrated
into a single threshold network that represents the control logic of
the entire BN. This simple integration requires that (1) eachautomaton is represented by two unique s-units, one for transitiontoonand another to off, and (2) s-units are linked via t-units with
appropriate fibres, as specified by each individual CM. Therefore
a unique t-unit represents each schema obtained in the redescrip-tion process. This results in the Dynamics Canalization Map (DCM)
for the entire BN. Since the DCM integrates the CMs of its
constituent automata, it can be used to identify the minimal control
conditions that are sufficient to produce transitions in the dynamics
of the entire network. Notice that when a node in the original BNundergoes a state-transition, it means that at least one t-unit fires
in the DCM. When a t-unit fires, according to the control logic of

the DCM, it can cause subsequent firing of other t-units. This
allows the identification of the causal chains of transitions that are the
building blocks of macro-level dynamics and information processing,
as explained in detail below.
Another important feature of the DCM is its compact size.
While the dynamical landscape of an automata network, definedby its state-transition graph (STG), grows exponentially with thenumber of nodes – 2
nin Boolean networks – its DCM grows only
linearly with 2nunits plus the number of t-units needed (which is
the number of schemata obtained from redescribing every
automaton in the network): 2nzPn
i~1jF’’ij. Furthermore, the
computation of a DCM is tractable even for very large networks
with thousands of nodes, provided the in-degree of these nodes isnot very large. In our current implementation, we can exhaustivelyperform schema redescription of automata with kƒk
max&20;
that is, LUTs containing up to 220entries. It is very rare that
dynamical models of biochemical regulation have molecularspecies that depend on more than twenty other variables (seee.g. [57]). Therefore, this method can be used to study canalization
and control in all discrete models of biochemical regulation we
have encountered in the literature, which we will analyseelsewhere.
It is important to emphasize that the integration of the CMs of
individual automata into the DCM does not change the controllogic encoded by each constituent CM, which is equivalent to the
logic encoded in the original LUT (after removal of redundancy).
Therefore, there is no danger of violating the logic encoded in theoriginal LUT of any automaton in a given BN. However, it isnecessary to ensure that any initial conditions specified in theDCM do not violate the laws of contradiction and excludedmiddle. This means, for instance, that no initial condition of theDCM can have the two ( onand off) s-units for the same automaton
firing simultaneously.
The DCM for a single cell in the SPN model is shown in
Figure 15. The spatial signals from adjacent cells are highlightedusing units with a double border (nhh,nHHand nWG). For the
simulations of the spatial SPN model described in subsequentsections, we use four coupled single-cell DCMs (each as inFigure 15) to represent the dynamics of the four-cell parasegment,where nodes that enable inter-cellular regulatory interactions areappropriately linked, as defined in the original model. Also, as inthe original model, we assume periodic boundary conditions forthe four-cell parasegment: the posterior cell is adjacent to theanterior cell. When making inferences using the DCM, we usesignal to refer to the firing of a s-unit and the transmission of this
information through its output fibres. When a s-unit fires in theDCM, it means that its corresponding automaton node in theoriginal BN transitioned to the state represented by the s-unit. Wealso use pathway to refer to a logical sequence of signals in the
DCM.
We highlight two pathway modules in the DCM of the SPN in
Figure 15: M
1andM2. The first is a pathway initiated by either
the inhibition of WG in neighbour cells, or the expression of SLPupstream in the same cell. That is, the initial pattern for this
module is M
0
1~:nWG_SLP. The initiating signal for M2is
defined by the negation of those that trigger the first:
M0
2~:M0
1~nWG^:SLP. Both modules follow from (external
or upstream) input signals to a single cell in the SPN; they do not
depend at all on the initial states of nodes (molecular species) of theSPN inside a given cell. Yet, both of these very small set of initialsignals necessarily cause a cascade of other signals in the networkover time. M
1is the only pathway that leads to the inhibition of enFigure 11. Micro-level canalization for the Automata in the SPN model. Schemata for inhibition (transitions to off) and expression
(transitions to on) are shown for each node (genes or proteins) in model. In-degree ( k), input redundancy ( kr), effective connectivity ( ke), and input

(and EN) as well as the expression of ci(and CI). It also causes the
inhibition of hhand HH, both of which function as inter-cellular
signals for adjacent cells – this inhibition can be alternatively
controlled by the expression of CIR, which is not part of neither
M1norM2. Since M0
1is a disjunction, its terms are equivalent:
either the inhibition of nWG or the upstream expression of SLP
control the same pathway, regardless of any other signals in thenetwork. M
2is the only pathway that leads to the expression of en
(and EN) as well as the inhibition of ci(and CI); It also causes the
inhibition of CIA, ptcand CIR – these inhibitions can be
alternatively controlled by other pathways. If the initial conditions
M0
2are sustained for long enough (steady-state inputs), the
downstream inhibition of CIA and sustained inhibition of SLP
lead to the inhibition of wg(and WG); likewise, from sustaining
M0
2, the downstream expression of EN and inhibition of CIR lead
to the expression of hh(and HH). Since M0
2is a conjunction, both
terms are required: both the expression of nWG and the upstream
inhibition of SLP are necessary and sufficient to control this
pathway module, regardless of any other signals in the network.
M1andM2capture a cascade of state transitions that are
inexorable once their initiating signals ( M0
1andM0
2) are observed:
M1~f:en,:EN, :hh,:HH, ci,C IgandM2~f:ci,:CI,
:CIA, :wg,:WG, :CIR, :ptc,en, EN, hh,H H g. Further-
more, these cascades are independent from the states of other nodes
in the network. As a consequence, the transitions within a module
are insensitive to delays once its initial conditions are set (and
maintained in the case of M2as shown). The dynamics within these
portions of the DCM can thus be seen as modular ; these pathway
modules can be decoupled from the remaining regulatory dynamics,
in the sense that they are not affected by the states of any othernodes other than their initial conditions. Modularity in complex
networks has been typically defined as sub-graphs with high intra-
connectivity [21]. But such structural notion of community
structure does not capture the dynamically decoupled behaviour
of pathway modules such as M
1andM2in the SPN. Indeed, it
has been recently emphasized that understanding modularity in
complex molecular networks requires accounting for dynamics
[58], and new measures of modularity in multivariate dynamical
systems have been proposed by our group [59]. We will describemethods for automatic detection of dynamical modularity in
DCMs elsewhere.
Collective computation in the macro-level dynamics of autom-
ata networks ultimately relies on the interaction of these pathway
modules. Information gets integrated as modules interact with one
another, in such a way that the timing of module activity can have
an effect on downstream transitions. For instance, the expression
of CI via M
1can subsequently lead to the expression of CIA,
provided that nhhis expressed – and this is controlled by M2in
the adjacent cells. The expression of CI can also be seen as a
necessary initial condition to the only pathway that results in the
expression of CIR, which also depends on the inhibition of nhh
andnHH and the expression of PTC, which in turn depends on
the interaction of other modules, and so on. As these examples
show, pathway modules allow us to uncover the building blocks of
macro-level control – the collective computation of automata
network models of biochemical regulation. We can use them, for
instance, to infer which components exert most control on a targetcollective behaviour of interest, such as the wild-type expressionpattern in the SPN. Indeed, modules M
1andM2in the SPN
model, which include a large proportion of nodes in the DCM,
highlight how much SLP and the spatial signals from neighbouring
cells control the dynamical behaviour of segment polarity gene
regulation in each individual cell. Particularly, they almost entirely
control the expression and inhibition of EN and WG; as discussedfurther below. The behaviour of these proteins across a four-cell
parasegment mostly define the attractors of the model (including
wild-type). The transitions of intra-cellular nodes are thus more
controlled by the states of ‘external’ nodes than by the initial
pattern of expression of genes and proteins in the cell itself. Thisemphasizes the well-known spatial constraints imposed on each
cell of the fruit fly’s developmental system [60,61]. We next study
and quantify this control in greater detail.
Dynamical unfolding. A key advantage of the DCM is that
it allows us to study the behaviour of the underlying automata
network without the need to specify the state of all of its nodes.
Modules M1andM2are an example of how the control that a
very small subset of nodes exerts on the dynamics of SPN can bestudied. This can be done because, given the schema redescription
that defines the DCM, subsets of nodes can be assumed to be in an
unknown state. Since the schema redescription of every automaton
in the DCM is minimal and complete (see micro-level canalization
section), every possible transition that can occur is accounted for inthe DCM. By implementing the DCM as a threshold network, we
gain the ability to study the dynamics of the original BN by setting
the states of subsets of nodes. This allows us study convergence to
attractors, or other patterns of interest, from knowing just a few
nodes.
More formally, we refer to an initial pattern of interest of a BN
Bas a partial configuration , and denote it by ^x. For example, M
0
1is a
partial configuration ^x~M0
1~SLP _:nWG , where the states of
all other nodes is #, or unknown. We refer to dynamical unfolding as
the sequence of transitions that necessarily occur after an initial
partial configuration ^x, and denote it by s(^x)
P, where Pis an
outcome pattern or configuration. From the DCM of the single-cell
SPN model (Figure 15), we have s(M0
1)
M1and
s(M0
2)
M2. An outcome pattern can be a fully specified
attractor A, but it can also be a partial configuration of an
attractor where some nodes remain unknown – for instance, to
study what determines the states of a specific subset of nodes of
interest in the network. In the first case, it can be said that ^xfully
controls the network dynamics towards attractor A. In the second,
control is exerted only on the subset of nodes with determined
logical states.
The ability to compute the dynamical unfolding of a BN from
partial configurations is a key benefit of the methodology
introduced here: it allows us to determine how much partial
configurations of interest control the collective dynamics of the
network. For instance, in the SPN model it is possible to
investigate how much the input nodes to the regulatory network
of each cell control its dynamics. Or, conversely, how much the
initial configuration of the intra-cellular regulatory network is
irrelevant to determining its attractor. The nodes within each cellin a parasegment of the SPN are sensitive to three inter-cellular
(external) input signals: nWG, nhh andnHH, and one intra-
cellular (upstream) input, SLP. Given that the formation of
parasegment boundaries in D. melanogaster is known to be tightlyFigure 13. Canalizing Maps of individual nodes in the SPN model (part 1). The set of schemata for each automaton is converted into two

spatially constrained [60,61], it is relevant to investigate how
spatio-temporal control occurs in the SPN model. We already
studied the control power of SLP and nWG, which lead to
modules M1andM2. We now exhaustively study the dynamical
unfolding of all possible states of the intra- and inter-cellular input
signals.
We assume that SLP (upstream) and the (external) spatial signals
are in steady-state to study what happens in a single cell. Since the
state of nHH is the same as nhhafter one time step, we consolidate
those input signals into a single one: nhh. We are left with three
input signals to the intra-cellular regulatory network: nodes SLP,
nWG and nhh. Each of these three nodes can be in one of two
states ( on,off) and thus there are eight possible combinations of
states for these nodes. Such simplification results in a non-spatial
model and this was done previously by Willadsen & Wiles [52].
Setting each such combination as the initial partial configuration
^x, and allowing the DCM to compute transitions, yields the results
shown in Figure 16. We can see that only two of the outcome
patterns reached by the eight input partial configurations are
ambiguous about which of the final five possible attractors is
reached. Each individual cell in a parasegment can only be in oneof five attractor patterns I1{I5(see}background). This is the
case of groups G2andG4in Figure 16. For all the other input
partial configurations, the resulting outcome pattern determinesthe final attractor. We also found that for almost every input
partial configuration, the states of most of the remaining nodes are
also resolved; in particular the nodes that define the signature ofthe parasegment attractor – Engrailed (EN) and Wingless (WG) –
settle into a defined steady-state. Notice also that for two of the
input partial configurations (groups G3andG5in Figure 16), the
states of every node in the network settle into a fully defined
steady-state. The picture of dynamical unfolding from the intra-
and inter-cellular inputs of the single-cell SPN network also allows
us to see the roles played by modules M
1and M2in the
dynamics. The six input configurations in groups G1, G2, and G3depict the dynamics where M
1is involved, while the two input
configurations in G4 and G5 refer to M2(node-states of each
module in these groups appear shaded in Figure 16). Bycomparing the resulting dynamics, we can see clearly the effect
of the additional information provided by knowing if nhh is
expressed or inhibited; we also see that the dynamics of themodules is unaffected by other nodes, as expected.Figure 14. Canalizing Maps of individual nodes in the SPN model (cont). The set of schemata for each automaton is converted into two

It is clear from these results that (single-cell) cellular dynamics in
the SPN is almost entirely controlled from the inputs alone. Wecan say that extensive micro-level canalization leads the macro-level network dynamics to be highly canalized by external inputs –a point we explore in more detail below. For the dynamicalunfolding depicted in Figure 16 we assumed that the three inputsignals to the intra-cellular regulatory network are in steady-state,focusing on a single cell. This is not entirely reasonable since inter-cellular signals are regulated by spatio-temporal regulatorydynamics in the full spatial SPN model. We thus now pursuethe identification of minimal partial configurations that guarantee
convergence to outcome patterns of interest in the spatial SPNmodel, such as specific (parasegment) attractors.
Minimal configurations. To automate the search of min-
imal configurations that converge to patterns of interest, we relyagain on the notion of schema redescription, but this time fornetwork-wide configurations rather than for individual automataLUTs. Notice that the eight input partial configurations used inthe dynamical unfolding scenarios described in Figure 16 arewildcard schemata of network configurations: the state of the 14
Figure 16. Dynamical unfolding of the (single-cell) SPN with partial input configurations. The eight initial partial configurations tested
correspond to the combinations of the steady-states of intra- and inter-cellular inputs SLP, nWG and nhh (and where nHH and nhh are merged into a
single node, nhh). The specific state-combinations of these three variables is depicted on the middle (white) tab of each dynamical unfolding plot.
Initial patterns that reach the same target pattern are grouped together in five groups G1toG5(identified in the top tab of each plot). The six input
configurations in groups G1, G2, and G3 depict the dynamics where pathway module M1is involved (nodes involved in this module are highlighted
in pink.) The two input configurations in G4 and G5 depict the dynamics where pathway module M2is involved (nodes involved in this module are
highlighted in blue.) Three of the eight combinations are in G1because they reach the same final configuration which, although partial, can only
match the attractor I1. There are five possible attractor patterns of the SPN model for a single cell, shown in bottom right inset: I1toI5(see}
background). Attractors reached by each group are identified in the bottom tab of each plot. Groups G2andG4both unfold to an ambiguous target
pattern that can end in I2orI5forG2, and I3orI4forG4. Finally, the initial partial configurations in groups G3andG5are sufficient to resolve the
states of every node in the network.

inner nodes is unknown (wildcard), and only three (input) nodes
(SLP, nWG, nhh) are set to a combination of Boolean states. Each
of these eight schemata redescribes 214possible configurations of
the single-cell SPN. Six of the eight input schemata converge toone of the five possible attractors for inner nodes in a single cell ofthe SPN model (Figure 16). We can thus think of those six
schemata as minimal configurations (MCs) that guarantee conver-
gence to patterns (e.g. attractors) of interest.
More specifically, a MC is a 2-symbol schema x’’that
redescribes a set of network configurations that converge to target
pattern P; when the MC is a wildcard schema, it is denoted by x’.
Therefore, s(x
0’)
P. MC schemata, x’’orx’, are network
configurations where the truth value of each constituent autom-aton can be 0, 1, or #(unknown); symmetry groups are allowed
forx’’and identified with position-free symbols
0m(see Micro-level
canalization section). An MC schema redescribes a subset Hof the
set of configurations X:H:fx[X:x
 x00g. A partial config-
uration is a MC if no Boolean state in it can be raised to theunknown state ( #) and still guarantee that the resulting partial
configuration converges to P. In the case of a two-symbol schema,
no group-invariant enput can be enlarged (include additionalnode-states) and still guarantee convergence to P. Finally, the
target pattern Pcan be a specific network configuration (e.g. an
attractor), or it can be a set of configurations of interest (e.g. when
only some genes or proteins are expressed). After redescription of a
set of configurations Xof a BN – a subset or its full dynamical
landscape – we obtain a set of two-symbol MCs X’’; a set of
wildcard MCs is denoted by X’. Similarly to micro-level schemata,
we can speak of enputs of MCs. In this context, they refer to
individual and sets of node-states in the network that are essential
to guarantee convergence to a target pattern.
The dynamical unfolding example of the single-cell SPN model
shows that to converge to the attractor I1(Figure 16, G1), only the
states of the three input nodes need to be specified, in one of three
possible Boolean combinations: 000,100 or110for the nodes SLP,
nWG and nhh; all other (inner) nodes may be unknown ( #).
Moreover, these three initial patterns can be further redescribedinto two schemata: X’~ff#,0,0g,f1,#,0gg. This shows that to
guarantee converge to I1, we only need to know the state of two
(input) nodes: either nWG~nhh~0, or SLP = 1 and nhh~0. All
other nodes in the single-cell model can remain unknown.Therefore, the MCs for attractor pattern I1are:
X0~f############### 00,############## 1#0gð10Þ
where the order of the inner nodes is the same as in Figure 16,
and the last three nodes are SLP, nWG and nhhin that order.
Notice that in this case there is no group-invariance, so X’’~X’.
Any initial configuration not redescribed by X’, does not converge
to pattern I1. Therefore, these MCs reveal the enputs (minimal set
of node-states) that control network dynamics towards attractor I1:
nhh must remain unexpressed, and we must have either SLP
expressed, or nWG unexpressed. However, as mentioned above,
this example refers to the case when the three input nodes are in
steady-state. For the single-cell SPN, the steady-state assumption is
reasonable. But for the spatial SPN, with parasegments of fourcells, we cannot be certain that the spatial signals ( nWG and nhh)
have reached a steady-state at the start of the dynamics. Therefore,
we now introduce a procedure for obtaining MCs, without the
steady-state assumption, which we apply to the spatial SPNnetwork model.
It was discussed previously that individual automata in BN
models of biochemical regulation and signalling very rarely havelarge numbers of input variables. This allows tractable computa-
tion of two-symbol schema redescription of their LUTs (see micro-level section). In contrast, computing MCs for network configu-rations easily becomes more computationally challenging. Even for
fairly small networks with n&20, the size of their dynamical
landscape becomes too large to allow full enumeration of thepossible configurations and the transitions between them. Asshown above, it is possible to identify pathway modules, and tocompute dynamical unfolding on the DCM, without knowing theSTG of very large BNs, but it remains not feasible to fullyredescribe their entire dynamical landscape.
One way to deal with high-dimensional spaces is to resort to
stochastic search (see e.g. [62]). We use stochastic search to obtain
MCs that are guaranteed to converge to a pattern of interest P.
We start with a seedconfiguration known to converge to P. Next, a
random node in a Boolean state is picked, and changed to the
unknown state. The resulting partial configuration is then allowedto unfold to determine if it still converges to P. If it does, the
modified configuration becomes the new seed. The process isrepeated until no more nodes can be ‘raised’ to the unknown stateand still ensure convergence to P. Otherwise, the search continues
picking other nodes. The output of this algorithm (detailed in Data
S4) is thus a single wildcard MC. Afterwards, the goal is to search
forsetsof MCs that converge to P. We do this in two steps: first we
search for a set of MCs derived from a single seed, followed by asearch of the space of possible different seeds that still converge toP. We use two ‘tolerance’ parameters to determine when to stop
searching. The first, d, specifies the number of times a single seed
must be ‘reused’ in the first step. When the algorithm has reusedthe seed dconsecutive times without finding any new MCs, the
first step of the MC search stops. The second tolerance parameter,r, is used to specify when to stop searching for new seeds from
which to derive MCs. When rconsecutively generated random
(and different) seeds are found to be already redescribed by the
current set of MCs, the algorithm stops. Both parameters are resetto zero every time a new MC is identified. These two steps areexplained in greater detail in Data S4 .
The two-step stochastic search process results in a set of
wildcard schemata X’that redescribe a given set of configurations
Xguaranteed to converge to pattern P. We next obtain a set of
two-symbol MCs X’’from X’, by identifying group-invariant
subsets of nodes using the same method described in the micro-level canalization section. Since X’can be quite large (see below),
this computation can become challenging. In this case, we restrict
the search for symmetric groups in X’that redescribe a minimum
number bof wildcard MCs x’.
Notice that it is the DCM, implemented as a threshold network,
that allows us to pursue this stochastic search of MCs. With theoriginal BN, we cannot study dynamics without setting everyautomaton to a specific Boolean truth value. With the DCM,obtained from micro-level canalization, we are able to set nodes tothe unknown state and study the dynamical unfolding of a partialconfiguration (see previous subsection) to establish convergence toa pattern of interest. Therefore, the DCM helps us link micro-levelcanalization to macro-level behaviour. Let us exemplify the
approach with the SPN model.
We started our study of MCs in the spatial SPN model, with a
set of seedconfigurations X
biothat contains the known initial
configuration of the SPN (shown in Figure 3), the wild-typeattractor (Figure 4a), and the five configurations in the dynamictrajectory between them. When searching for MCs using these
seed configurations we set d~10
5. This resulted in a set containing
90 wildcard MCs X’bio(available in data S7 ). Using the set X’bio,
we performed the two-step stochastic search with r~106and(10)Canalization and Control in Automata Networks
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 22 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e55946
d~105. This resulted in a much larger set of 1745 wildcard MCs
(available in data S8 ) which guarantee convergence to wild-type:
X’wt6X’bio. The number of literal enputs in each MC contained
in this set varies from 23 to 33 – out of the total 60 nodes in aparasegment. In other words, from all configurations in X’
wtwe
can ascertain that to guarantee convergence to the wild-typeattractor, we need only to control the state of a minimum of 23and a maximum of 33 of the 60 nodes in the network.Equivalently, 27 to 37 nodes are irrelevant in steering thedynamics of the model to the wild-type attractor – a high degree ofcanalization we quantify below.
We chose to study two further subsets of X’
wtseparately: X’noP
andX’min. The first (available in data S9 ) is the subset of MCs that
do not have enputs representing expressed ( on) proteins, except
SLP 3,4– since SLP in cells 3 and 4 is assumed to be present from
the start, as determined by the pair-rule gene family (see [26] and
introductory section). This is a subset of interest because itcorresponds to the expected control of the SPN at the start of thesegment-polarity dynamics, including its known initial configura-tion (Figure 3); thus X’
noP5X’wt. The second, X’min5X’wtis the
subset of MCs with the smallest number of enputs (available in data
S10. This corresponds to the set of 32 MCs in X’wtthat have only
23 enputs each. This is a subset of interest because it allows us tostudy how the unfolding to wild-type can be guaranteed with thesmallest possible number of enputs. Notice that X’
minredescribes a
large subset of configurations in Xwtbecause it contains the MCs
with most redundant number of nodes. These sets of wildcardMCs are available in data S7,S8, S9 and S10; Table 3 contains their
size.
There are severe computational limitations to counting exactly
the number of configurations redescribed by each set of MCs,since it depends on using the inclusion/exclusion principle [63] tocount the elements of intersecting sets (MCs redescribe overlap-ping sets of configurations). See Data S6 for further details. We can
report the exact value for jX’
noPj~8:35|1010, which is about
14% of the number of configurations – or pre-patterns – estimated
by Albert & Othmer [26] to converge to the wild-type attractor
(6|1011). Using the inclusion/exclusion principle, it was also
computationally feasible to count the configurations redescribed
by a sample of 20 of the 32 MCs in X’min:9:6|1011. Since this
sample of 20 MCs is a subset of X’min, which is a subset of X’wt,
we thus demonstrate that jXwtj§jXminj§9:6|1011, which is 1:6
times larger than the previously estimated number of pre-patternsconverging to the wild-type attractor [26]. This means that thewild-type attraction basin is considerably (at least 1.6 times) larger
than previously estimated, with a lower bound of at least
9:6|10
11network configurations. Although it was not computa-
tionally feasible to provide exact counts for the remaining MC sets,it is reasonable to conclude that the set X’
wtredescribes asignificant proportion of the wild-type attractor basin, given the
number of configurations redescribed by 20 of its most canalizedMCs in comparison to the previous estimate of its size. Indeed, wepursued a very wide stochastic search with large toleranceparameters, arriving at a large number (1745) MCs, each ofwhich redescribes a very large set of configurations. For instance,each MC with the smallest number of enputs (23) alone redescribes
1:37|10
11configurations, which is about 23% of the original
estimated size of the wild-type attractor basin, and 14% of the
lower bound for the size of the attractor basin we computed above.
Given the large number of MCs in the X’wtset, even with likely
large overlaps of configurations, much of the attractor basin oughtto be redescribed by this set.
From X’
wt, we derived two-symbol MC sets using b~8. That is,
due to the computational limitations discussed previously, werestricted the search to only those two-symbol MCs x’’that
redescribe at least b~8wildcard MCs x’. Given that configura-
tions of the spatial SPN are defined by 60automata states, the
group-invariance enputs we may have missed with this constraintare rather trivial. For instance, we may have missed MCs with asingle group-invariant enput of 3 variables (any group-invariantenput with 4 variables would be found), or MCs with 2 distinctgroup-invariant enputs of 2 variables each (any MCs with 3 group-invariant enputs would be found.) With this constraint on the
search for two-symbol MCs, we identified only the pair of two-
symbol MCs depicted in Figure 17: fx’’
1,x’’2g– each redescribing
16 wildcard MCs – the MCs redescribed are available in data S13 .
These two MCs redescribe 1:95|1011configurations; that is,
about 32% of the wild-type attraction basin as estimated by [26],
or20% of the lower bound for the size of the attractor basin we
computed above – a very substantial subset of the wild-typeattractor basin.
No other two-symbol MCs redescribing at least eight wildcard
MCs were found in the set X’
wt. Therefore, X’’wtis comprised of
the wildcard MCs in X’wtwith the addition of fx’’1,x’’2gand
removal of the wildcard MCs these two schemata redescribe.Table 3 contains the size of all MC sets. Moreover, fx’’
1,x’’2g
have no intersecting schemata with the additional three subsets of
X’’wtwe studied. This means that the two-symbol redescription
(with b~8) is equal to the wildcard redescription of the sets of
configurations Xbio,XnoPandXmin. The pair of two-symbol MCs
identified denote two very similar minimal patterns that guaranteeconvergence to the wild-type attractor. In both MCs, the pairs ofnodes wg
2,4,H H 2,4as well as ci4and CI 4are marked with distinct
position-free symbols. In other words, they have three identical
group-invariant enputs. For x’’1a fourth group-invariant enput
comprises the nodes hh1,3, while for x’’2the fourth group-invariant
enput contains the nodes HH 1,3. For x’’2there is an extra literal
enput: ptc4~0(ptcgene in fourth cell is unexpressed). TheTable 3. Macro-level canalization in the wildcard MC sets converging to wild-type in the SPN.

remaining literal enputs are identical to those of x’’1. The group-
invariance in these MCs is not very surprising considering theequivalent roles of neighbouring hedgehog and Wingless for intra-cellular dynamics – as discussed previously when the SPN’s DCMwas analysed. Notice that most group-invariance occurs for thesame genes or proteins in alternative cells of the parasegment; forinstance, wgexpressed in either cell 2 or cell 4. Nonetheless, both
two-symbol MCs offer two minimal conditions to guarantee
convergence to the wild-type attractor, which includes a very largeproportion of the wild-type attractor basin. Therefore, they serveas a parsimonious prescription for analysts who wish to control themacro-level behaviour (i.e. attractor behaviour) of this system.Finally, the MCs obtained observe substantial macro-levelcanalization which we quantify below.
Quantifying Macro-level Canalization
In the micro-level canalization section, we defined measures of
input redundancy ,effective connectivity and input symmetry to quantify
micro-level canalization from the schema redescription of individ-ual automata. Since we can also redescribe configurations thatproduce network dynamics, leading to the minimal configurations(MCs) of the previous section, we can use very similar measures toquantify macro-level canalization and control. At the macro-level,high canalization means that network dynamics are more easilycontrollable: MCs contain fewer necessary and sufficient node-states (enputs) to guarantee convergence to an attractor or targetpattern P. Similarly to the micro-level case, we first define upper
and lower bounds of node redundancy computed from the set of MCs
X’’for a target pattern:
/C22nn
r(X,P)~P
x[Xmax
h:x[Hhn#
h/C16/C17
jXjð11Þnr(X,P)~P
x[Xmin
h:x[Hhn#
h/C16/C17
jXjð12Þ
These expressions tally the mean number of irrelevant nodes in
controlling network dynamics towards Pfor all configurations xof
a set of configurations of interest X(e.g. a basin of attraction). The
number of irrelevant nodes in a given MC x’’his the number of its
wildcards n#
h. Because each configuration xis redescribed by one
or more MCs, there are various ways to compute a characteristic
number of irrelevant nodes associated with the configurations,which is nonetheless bounded by the maximum and minimumnumber of wildcards in the set of MCs that redescribe x.
Therefore, the expressions above identify all MCs whose set ofredescribed configurations H
hincludes x. The upper (lower)
bound of node redundancy, Equation 11 (Equation 12),corresponds to considering the maximum (minimum) number of
irrelevant nodes found for all MCs that redescribe configuration x
of the interest set – an optimist (pessimist) quantification of thistype of macro-level canalization. Here we use solely the upperbound, which we refer to henceforth simply as node redundancy with
the notation n
r(X,P). Similarly to the micro-level case, the
assumption is that the most redundant MCs are always accessiblefor control of the network towards pattern P. The range for node
redundancy is 0ƒn
rƒn, where nis the number of nodes in the
network. When nr(X,P)~nwe have full node irrelevance, or
maximum canalization, which occurs only in the case of networkswhere the state of every node is not dependent on any input (thatis, when k
r~kfor every node). If nr(X,P)~0, the state of every
node is always needed to determine convergence to Pand we have
no macro-level canalization.

If some nodes of a network are irrelevant to steer dynamics to P,
from a control logic perspective, we can say that Pis effectively
controlled by a subset of nodes of the network with fewer than n
nodes. In other words, by integrating the micro-level control logicof automata in a network into the DCM, we are able to computeMCs and infer from those the macro-level effective control , which is
not apparent from looking at connectivity structure alone:

Macro-level canalization can also manifest alternative control
mechanisms. The two-symbol schema redescription allows us tomeasure this form of control by computing the mean number ofnodes that participate in group-invariant enputs, easily tallied bythe number of position-free symbols ( n

characterize convergence to target pattern P. Thus, we quantify
the upper and lower bounds of node symmetry in a set of

Here we use solely the upper bound, which we refer to
henceforth simply as node symmetry and denote by ns(X,P); its
range is ½0,n/C138. Again, the assumption is that the most canalized
MCs are always accessible for control of the network towardspattern P. High (low) values mean that permutations of node-
states are likely (unlikely) to leave the transition unchanged.
Macro-level canalization in network dynamics is then quantified
by two types of redundancy: node redundancy (or its counterpart,effective control) and node symmetry. To be able to comparemacro-level control in automata networks of different sizes, we cancompute relative measures of canalization:
n
/C3
r(X,P)~nr(X,P)
n;
n/C3
e(X,P)~ne(X,P)
n;
n/C3
s(X,P)~ns(X,P)
nð16Þ
whose range is ½0,1/C138:Network dynamics towards a pattern of
interest Pcan have different amounts of each form of canalization,
which allows us to consider four broad classes of control in
network dynamics – just like the micro-level canalization case (see
above).
The two MCs identified above for the single-cell SPN model
(Eq. 10), redescribe the full set of configurations that converge toI1. Since these MC schemata do not have group-invariant enputs,
node symmetry does not exist: n
s(X,I1)~0. Node redundancy
and effective control is nr(X,I1)~15andne(X,I1)~2, respec-tively. In other words, even though the network of the single-cell
SPN model comprises n~17nodes, to control its dynamics
towards attractor I1, it is sufficient to ensure that the states of only
two nodes remain fixed; the initial state of the other 15 nodes is
irrelevant. More concretely, nhhmust remain offand either SLP
remains onornwg remains off. The relative measures become:
n/C3
r(X,I1)~15=17(&88% of nodes are redundant to guarantee
convergence to attractor I1)n/C3
e(X,I1)~2=17(one only needs to
control &12% of nodes to guarantee convergence to attractor I1),
andn/C3
s(X,I1)~0(there is no node symmetry in these MCs). This
means that there is a large amount of macro-level canalization of
the node redundancy type – and thus higher controllability – in
the basins of attraction of the SPN model where pattern I1is
present.
The macro-level canalization measures above assume that the
interest set of configurations Xcan be enumerated. Moreover,
schema redescription of network configurations itself assumes that
Xcan be sufficiently sampled with our stochastic search method
(see previous sub-section). The node symmetry measure addition-
ally assumes that the set of wildcard MCs obtained by stochastic
search is not too large to compute symmetric groups. While these
assumptions are easily met for micro-level analysis, because LUT
entries of individual automata in models of biochemical regulation
do not have very large number of inputs, they are more
challenging at the macro-level. Certainly, canalization in the
single-cell SPN model can be fully studied at both the micro- and
macro-levels – see Figures 11 and 12 for the former as well as
example above for the latter. But quantification of macro-level
canalization of larger networks, such as the spatial SPN model,
needs to be estimated. Therefore, in formulae 11, 12, 14, and 15,
the set of configurations Xis sampled: ^XX. Configurations for ^XX
are sampled from each MC in the set X’’, proportionally to the
number of configurations redescribed by each MC – i.e. roulette
wheel sampling. Configurations from a selected MC are sampled
by ascribing Boolean truth values to every wildcard in the MC
schema; the proportion of each of the truth values is sampled from
a uniform distribution. If a selected MC is a 2-symbol schema, the
truth-values of group-invariant enputs are also sampled from auniform distribution of all possible possibilities. Naturally, the
same configuration xcan be redescribed by more than one MC h.
In summary, macro-level canalization for larger networks is
quantified with the estimated measures: ^nn
r,^nne, and ^nns, as well as
their relative versions.
Tables 3 and 4 summarize the quantification of macro-level
canalization estimated for the four MC sets obtained above: X’’wt,
X’’min,X’’bio, and X’’noP. Effective control ( ne) ranges between 23
and26:2nodes (out of 60) for the four sets of MCs; this means (see
n/C3
e) that only 38to44% of nodes need to be controlled to
guarantee convergence to wild-type. This shows that there is
substantial macro-level canalization in the wild-type attractor
basin; from n/C3
r, we can see that 56to62% of nodes are, on average,
redundant to guarantee convergence to wild-type. On the other
hand, macro-level canalization in the form of alternative (or
symmetric) control mechanisms is not very relevant on thisattractor basin, as observed by the low values of n
sandn/C3
s: in the
wild-type attractor basin, on average, only approximately 1 out 60
nodes, or 1:6%can permute.
Enput Power and Critical Nodes
Every MC is a schema, and hence comprises a unique set of
enputs, not entirely redescribed by any other MC. As defined in
the micro-level canalization section, an enput ecan be literal – a
single node in a specific Boolean state – or a group-invariant
enput: a set of nodes with a symmetry constraint. Every enput einCanalization and Control in Automata Networks

a given MC is essential to ensure convergence to a pattern P, e.g.
an attractor A. Consequently, if the state or constraint of eis
disrupted in the MC, without gaining additional knowledge about
the configuration of the network, we cannot guarantee conver-
gence to P. How critical isein a set of configurations Xredescribed
by an MC set X’’– such as the set of MCs that redescribe a basin
of attraction? Since there are usually alternative MCs thatredescribe the possible dynamic trajectories to P, the more e
appears in X’’, the more critical it is in guaranteeing convergence
toP.
For instance, in the two MCs shown in Equation 10, the enput
e:(nhh~0)is common to both. Therefore, disrupting it, without
gaining additional knowledge about the state of other nodes,would no longer guarantee convergence to the attractor pattern I1
in the single-cell SPN dynamics. Similarly, for the two-symbol MCset of the spatial SPN model, shown in Figure 17, enputse:(hh
2,4~0)and group-invariant enput e:(wg2~1_wg4~1)
appear in both MCs. Disrupting them, would no longer guarantee
convergence to wild-type attractor in the spatial SPN dynamics.
Let us quantify the potential disruption of target dynamics by
perturbation of enputs in an MC set. The power of an enput ein a
set of configurations X
 X00:s(x)
P,Vx[X, is given by:
(e,X00,P)~jXej
jXjð17Þ
where Xe(Xis the subset of configurations redescribed by X’’
that contain enput e:Xe:fx[X:xx00^e[x00g. Thus, this
measure yields the proportion of configurations in Xredescribed
by the MCs in which eis an enput; its range is ½0,1/C138. If an enput
appears in every MC, as in the examples above, then E~1–i n
which case eis said to have full power overX’’. For the analysis of
the SPN model below when 0:5ƒEv1,eis a high power enput,
when 0vev0:5it is a low power enput, and when E~0it is a null
power enput. The larger the power of e, the more its perturbation is
likely to disrupt convergence to the target pattern P. When Xis
too large, we estimate ^– similarly to the canalization measures
discussed in the previous subsection.
We studied the wild-type attractor basin of the spatial SPN
model using the four MC sets of interest: X’’wt,X’’min,X’’bio, and
X’’noP(see Minimal configurations subsection above) focusing on
the power of literal enputs only. It is also possible to compute theenput power of group-invariant enputs. For example, the two-symbol MC x’’
1in Figure 17, has one of its four group-invariant
enputs defined by ci~1_CI~1. The power of this enput wouldtally those MCs in which this condition holds. Nonetheless, here
we only measure the power of literal enputs and present the studyof the power of group-invariant enputs elsewhere. The enput
power computed for these four sets is depicted in Figure 18, where
the output nodes PH and SMO are omitted because they arenever input variables to any node in the SPN model, and therefore
have null power. For the discussion of these results, it is useful to
compare them to the known initial condition, x
inidepicted in
Figure 3, and the wild-type attractor, Awtdepicted in Figure 4 (a).
Enput power in X’’wt(see Figure 18A). The enputs with full
power (E~1) are: SLP 1,2~0, SLP 3,4~1,hh2,4~0andptc1~0.
This is not entirely surprising since all of these genes and proteins
are specified as such in both xiniandAwt. However, these values
show that these enputs must remain in these states in the entire
(sampled) wild-type basin of attraction. In other words, these
enputs are critical controllers of the dynamics to the wild-type
attractor. Indeed, the wild-type is not robust to changes in these
enputs, which are likely to steer the dynamics to other attractors,
as discussed further in the next section. Therefore, the spatial SPN
model appears to be unable to recover the dynamic trajectory tothe wild-type attractor when either the hedgehog gene is expressed
in cells two and four; or the patched gene is expressed in the
anterior cell, as well when the initial expression pattern of SLPdetermined upstream by the pair-rule gene family is disrupted in
any way. There are also enputs with high power to control wild-type
behaviour: wg
1,3~WG 1,3~0,en1~1, PTC 1~0,en2,4~0,
ptc3~1,C I 3~0and CIR 3~1. Again, these are the states of
these genes and proteins in the known initial configuration of theSPN x
ini, and most of them, except for ptc3~1,C I 3~0and
CIR 3~1correspond to their final states in Awt.
In Figure 18A every node in the SPN – except the omitted
nodes PH and SMO – appear as an enput, in at least one Boolean
state, in many cases with very low values of . Thus, while macro-level dynamics is significantly canalized (see above), especially by
SLP and the spatial signals for each cell, control of wild-type can
derive from alternative strategies, whereby every node can act asan enput in some context. Nonetheless, most nodes ultimately do
not observe much power to control wild-type behaviour, thus
interventions to disturb wild-type behaviour are most effective viathe few more powerful controllers (see also next section).
We can also compare the enput power computed for X’’
wt
(Figure 18A), with the two-symbol MCs x’’1andx’’2in Figure 17.
These two MCs redescribe a significant portion of the wild-type
attractor basin – 20% of our lower bound count of this basin.
Because they only appear in X’’wtand not in any of the other MC
sets we studied, the portion of the wild-type attractor basin they
redescribe is unique to Xwt, and can be analysed via x’’1andx’’2.
Most of the literal enputs specified in x’’1andx’’2have high power
inX’’wt, except for WG 2~wg4~CIR 1,2,4~1, which are enputs in
these two-symbol MCs that have low power. Conversely, there are
literal enputs with high-power in X’’wtthat are not enputs in these
two-symbol MCs: EN 2,4~0and PTC 1~0. A key distinguishing
feature of x’’1andx’’2is the expression of CIR across the entire
parasegment as well as of the wingless protein in the second cell,
both of which are different from the trajectory between the known
initial condition of the SPN and the wild-type attractor. Therefore,x’’
1andx’’2redescribe a (large) portion of the attractor basin
outside of the more commonly studied dynamical trajectories.
Enput power in X’’min(see Figure 18B). We found an
unexpected expression of CIR 2~1(now with full power) as well as
wg2~WG 2~1(high power). Other enputs whose expression is in
opposition to both xiniandAwtappear with low power: HH 2,4~1
and CIR 1~1. This again suggests that there is a substantial subset
of the wild-type attractor basin, controlled by these and otherTable 4. Macro-level canalization in the wildcard MC sets

enputs, distinct from the trajectory that results from the known
(biologically plausible) initial configuration. We can also see thatthere is a significant number of nodes that do not play the role ofenput in any MC – nodes with null power , depicted as small grey
circles – as well as many more enputs with full power. X’’
min
redescribes wild-type dynamics with the smallest number (23) of
enputs; this set contains only 32 MCs out of the 1731 in X’’wt.
However, these are the most macro-canalizing MCs thatguarantee convergence to wild-type. Indeed, because of theirparsimony, they redescribe a very large subset of the wild-type
attractor basin with at least 1.6 times more configurations thanwhat was previously estimated for this basin (see above).
Therefore, X’’
minprovides a solid baseline for the understanding
of control in the wild-type attractor basin. This means that the
genes and proteins with full power in this set are critical controllers
of wild-type behaviour.
Enput power in X’’bio(see Figure 18C). Because this MC set
only redescribes configurations in the dynamic trajectory from xini
toAwt, the transient dynamics observed in X’’wtandX’’min, e.g.
wg2~1and CIR 2~1, disappear. There are, however, other
enputs with full power: wg1,3~WG 1,3~0,en2,4~EN2,4~0,
ptc1~PTC 1~0. These critical enputs are particularly important
Figure 18. Enput power in the wild-type basin of attraction of the spatial SPN model. Enput power is shown for each of the four sets of
MCs considered in our analysis: (A) X’’wt, (B) X’’min, (C) X’’bioand (D) X’’noP. A parasegment is represented by four rounded rectangles, one for each
cell, where the anterior cell is at the top, and posterior at the bottom. Since enput power is computed for every node in each of its two possible
states, every cell rectangle has two rows of circles. The bottom row (marked on the sides with a white circle on the outside) corresponds to enput
power of the nodes when off, while the top row is the enput power when the same nodes are on(marked on the sides with a dark circle). Each circle
inside a cell’s rectangle corresponds to the power of a given enput in the corresponding subset of MCs identified by the letters A to D. Full power ishighlighted in red, other values in blue and scaled, while null power is depicted using small grey circles. Full power occurs only for enputs that arepresent in every MC (and configurations) of the respective set, whereas null power identifies nodes that are never enputs in any MC – alwaysirrelevant for the respective dynamical behaviour.

for restricting analysis to a better-known portion of the wild-type
attractor basin, for which the model was especially built.
Enput power in X’’noP(see Figure 18D). This set of MCs is
useful to understand the beginning of the segment polarityregulatory dynamics, with no proteins expressed. The set of
critical genes that must be expressed ( on) areptc
3andwg4, which
appear with full power; moreover, en1~hh1~ptc2~ci2~1
appear with high power. As shown in the figure, most other
enputs with full or high power correspond to genes and proteins
that must be inhibited ( off), except, of course, SLP 3,4that are
assumed to be always onin the SPN model.
We compared these results with previous work on identifying
critical nodes in the SPN model. Chaves et al. [38] deduced, from
the model’s logic, minimal ‘pre-patterns’ for the initial configura-tion of the SPN that guarantee convergence to wild-type attractor.
More specifically, two necessary conditions and one sufficient
condition were deduced, which we now contrast with the enputpower analysis.
Thefirst necessary condition for convergence to the wild-
type attractor is: ptc
3~1, assuming that all proteins are
unexpressed ( off) initially, and the sloppy pair gene rule is
maintained constant (i.e. SLP 1,2~0^SLP 3,4~1.) Of the MC sets
we analysed, only X’’noP obeys the (biologically plausible)
assumptions for this necessary condition. As we can see inFigure 18D, the enput ptc
3~1has full power on this MC set,
which confirms this previous theoretical result. However, since
every enput with full power is a necessary condition for the set of
configurations described by its MC set, we can derive other
necessary conditions for this set of configurations (with the sameassumptions), such as ptc
1~0,wg3~0,o rwg4~1(see below). We
can also see that not all assumptions for the first necessary
condition are necessary; while the sloppy pair rule appears as fourenputs with full power, not all proteins are required to be
unexpressed: the expression of HH is irrelevant in every cell of the
parasegment, as is the expression of PTC
2,3,W G 2,4, CIA 4, and
CIR 1,2,3. Moreover, the enput power analysis allows us to identify
‘degrees of necessity’; some enputs may not be necessary, but
almost always necessary. This is the case of the expression of en1,
which has high power in X’’noP, but is not a necessary condition as
a few MCs can guarantee convergence to wild-type with en1~0
(which also appears as enput with low power). Naturally, if werelax the assumptions for condition ptc
3~1, it may no longer be a
necessary condition. This can be see when we look at the enput
power analysis of the entire (sampled) wild-type basin X’’wt
(Figure 18A) or the smaller X’’bio(Figure 18C). In these cases,
which still preserve the sloppy pair rule assumption, ptc3~1is no
longer an enput with full power. This means that, according to thismodel, if some proteins are expressed initially, ptc
3~1is no longer
a necessary condition. Interestingly, we found that in the most
macro-canalizing subset of the attractor basin, X’’min(Figure 18B)
– which assumes the sloppy pair rule constraint but is not
constrained to initially unexpressed proteins – ptc3~1does
appear as an enput with full power again. This means that in themost parsimonious means to control convergence to wild-type
attractor, ptc
3~1is a necessary condition too. It is noteworthy
that in this case, not only can some proteins be expressed, but theexpression of CIR
2is also a necessary condition (enput with full
power).
The second necessary condition for convergence to the
wild-type attractor is: wg4~1_en1~1_ci4~1, assuming that all
proteins are unexpressed ( off) initially, and the sloppy pair gene
rule is maintained constant (i.e. SLP 1,2~0^SLP 3,4~1) [38].
Again, only X’’noPobeys the (biologically likely) assumptions for
this necessary condition. As we can see in Figure 18D, the enputwg4~1has full power, therefore it is a necessary condition.
However, the enput en1~1has high power, and the enput ci4~1
has no power. This means that they are not necessary, though
en1~1is most often needed. These results suggest that this
necessary condition could be shortened to wg4~1, because in our
sampling of the wild-type attractor basin, in the subset meeting the
assumptions of the condition, we did not find a single configura-tion where wg
4~0. Even though our stochastic search was very
large, it is possible that there may be configurations, with no
proteins expressed, where wg4~0^(en1~1_ci4~1), thus
maintaining the original necessary condition. However, our enput
power analysis gives a more realistic and nuanced picture of
control in the SPN model under the same assumptions. While the
necessary condition may be wg4~1_en1~1_ci4~1, the
individual enputs have strikingly different power in controlling
for wild-type behaviour: ci4~1was never needed (no power),
en1~1has high power, and wg4~1has full power. Naturally, if
we relax the assumptions for this condition, it may no longer be anecessary condition. For instance, if we allow proteins to be
expressed initially (still preserving the sloppy pair constraint), we
can find MCs that redescribe configurations where
wg
4~en1~ci4~0. We found 171 MCs in X’’wt(available in data
S14where this condition is not necessary, one of them depicted in
Figure 19.
Thesufficient condition for convergence to the wild-type
attractor is: wg4~1^ptc3~1, assuming that the sloppy pair
gene rule is maintained constant (i.e. SLP 1,2~0^SLP 3,4~1). A
variation of this sufficient condition assumes instead (maintaining
the sloppy pair gene rule): wg4~1^PTC 3~1In their analysis,
Chaves et al. [38] assume that all proteins are unexpressed and
that many other genes are initially inhibited ( off). Even though in
Chaves et al. [38] the initial condition itself only requiresptc
1~ci1,3~0, the argument hinges on propositions and facts
that require knowing the state of additional genes such as
en2~wg3~hh2,4~0. While Chaves et al. [38] concluded rightly
from this minimal pre-pattern, that convergence to the wild-type
pattern has a remarkable error correcting ability to expression
delays in all other genes, the condition does not really describe
robustness to premature expression of genes and proteins. It is
interesting to investigate sufficient conditions that do require the
states of most variables to be specified, giving us the ability to study
robustness to both delays and premature expression of chemical
species. The MC schemata we obtained with our macro-level
analysis allows us to investigate such sufficient conditions directly.
We searched the entire MC set X’’wtto retrieve the MCs with
thefewest number of enputs specified as on. The 10 MCs (available
inS11) we retrieved contain only 26 literal enputs, where in six
MCs the two nodes in the sufficient condition above ( wg4,ptc3),
plus the nodes from the sloppy pair rule (SLP 3,4) are on, 24 are off
and the remaining 32 are wildcards, and thus irrelevant. In the
remaining MCs, instead of ptc3~1, we found PTC 3~1to be an
enput. In those MCs ptc3~#. Converting all wildcards to offin
one of these MCs, confirms the sufficient condition, as can be seen
from Figure 20A, where SLP 3,4~wg4~ptc3~1, and everything
else is off. This can be seen as an ‘extreme’ condition to wild-type
attractor, with a minimum set of genes expressed. We also
searched for the opposite extreme scenario, retrieving all MCs
with the largest number of onnodes, that still converges to the
wild-type pattern (available in data S12 . By replacing all wildcards
in such MCs to on, we obtained the configuration in which only 16
nodes must be inhibited ( off), while the remaining 44 are
expressed ( on), depicted in Figure 20B. Interestingly, in this
extreme configuration, hhmust remain offacross the whole
parasegment.Canalization and Control in Automata Networks

Robustness to Enput Disruption
The power measure introduced in the previous subsection
allows us to predict critical nodes in controlling network dynamicsto a pattern of interest P. A natural next step is to investigate what
happens when the critical controllers are actually disrupted. Wecan disrupt an enput ein an MC set with a variety of dynamic
regimes. Here, we adopt the approach proposed by Helikar et al.
[64], where a node of interest flips its state at time twith a
probability f, which can be seen to represent noise in regulatory
and signalling events, as well as the ‘concentration’ of a gene (itscorresponding mRNA) or protein – thus making it possible to useBoolean networks to study continuous changes in concentration ofbiochemical systems (see [64]).
We start from an initial set of configurations of interest: X
0.
This can be a single configuration, such as the known initial
configuration of the SPN X0:fxinig(as in Figure 3A), where the
enput eis in a specific (Boolean) value. Next, we set the value of
noise parameter f, which is the probability that emomentarily flips
from its state in X0at time t. This noise is applied at every time
step of the simulated dynamics; when a state-flip occurs at time t,
the node returns to its original state at tz1when noise with
probability foccurs again. Noise is applied to efrom t~0tot~m.
At time step t~mz1no more noise is applied to e(f~0) and the
network is allowed to converge to an attractor. This process isrepeated for Mtrials. Finally, we record the proportions of the M
trials that converged to different attractors.
Since in this paper we only computed enput power for literal
enputs (see previous subsection), we also only study literal enputdisruption. It is straightforward to disrupt group-invariant enputs;for instance, the group-invariant enput defined by ci~1_CI~1
from the two-symbol MC x’’
1in Figure 17, can be perturbed by
making ci~0^CI~0. Nonetheless, for simplicity, we present the
study of the disruption of group-invariant enputs elsewhere.
The enput power analysis in the previous subsection, revealed
that in the wild-type attractor basin ( Xwt) of the spatial SPN model
there are the following critical nodes (or key controllers): across theparasegment, SLP proteins must be inhibited in cells 1 and 2(SLP
1,2~0) and expressed in cells 3 and 4 (SLP 3,4~1), as
determined by the pair-rule gene family; hedgehog genes (spatial
signals) in cells 2 and 4 must be inhibited ( hh2,4~0); the patched
gene in the anterior cell must also be inhibited ( ptc1~0). With the
stochastic intervention procedure just described, we seek to answer two
questions about these key controllers: (1) how sensitive are they tovarying degrees of stochastic noise? and (2) which and how manyother attractors become reachable when they are disrupted? Inaddition to the seven full power enputs, for comparison purposes,
we also test the low power enput CI
4~0. In the original SPNmodel the states of SLP 1,2,3,4 are fixed (the sloppy gene
constraints). Because these naturally become enputs with full
power (see Figure 18), it is relevant to include them in this study of
enput disruption. However, by relaxing the fixed-state constraint
on SLP 1,2,3,4 , by inducing stochastic noise, the dynamical
landscape of the spatial SPN model is enlarged from 256to260
configurations. This means that more attractors than the ten
identified for the SPN Boolean model (depicted in Figure 4) arepossible, and indeed found as explained below.
We used X
0:fxinigas the initial state of the networks analysed
via stochastic interventions, because of its biological relevance.The simulations where performed with the following parameters:
f[½0:05,0 :95/C138, swept with D(f)~0:05, plus extremum values
f~0:02and f~0:98;m~500 steps; M~10
4. The simulation
results are shown in Figure 21.
The first striking result is that disruption of SLP 1~0makes it
possible to drive the dynamics away from wild-type into one of fiveother attractors (one of which a variant of wild-type). For fw0:15
no further convergence to wild-type is observed, and at f~0:05
the proportion of trials that converged to wild-type was already
very small. We also found phase transitions associated with the
values of f. For fƒ0:15most trials converged to wild-type, wild-
type (ptc mutant), broad-stripes or no-segmentation, and a verysmall proportion to two variants of the ectopic mutant. When
f~0:15the proportion of trials converging to broad-stripes
reaches its peak, and decreases, so that no trial converged to thismutant expression pattern for f§0:55. Finally, for f§0:55
convergence to the ectopic variants reaches its peak and decreases
steadily but does not disappear, while convergence to the no-
segmentation mutant increases becoming almost 100% when
f~0:98. We thus conclude that SLP
1~0is a wild-type attractor
enput which is very sensitive to noise.
In the case of SLP 3~1, we observed convergence to an
attractor that is not any of the original ten attractors –characterized by having two engrailed bands in cells 1 and 3
(see Data S5). The proportion of trials converging to wild-type and
to the new attractor decrease and increase respectively, reachingsimilar proportions when f~0:5. When f~0:98, almost every
trial converged to the new attractor. We conclude that SLP

a wild-type attractor enput whose robustness is proportional to
noise.
Disruption of SLP 4~1resulted in a behaviour similar to SLP 1,
but with fewer possible attractors reached. As fis increased, fewer
trials converge to wild-type and growing proportions of trials
converge to the wild-type ptcmutant pattern (reaching a peak at
f~0:5) and the no-segmentation mutant. For more extreme values
off, the majority of trials converged to the no-segmentation
mutant. However, an important difference with respect to SLP 1
was observed: for fƒ0:5the majority of trials converged to wild-
type, and convergence to this attractor is observed for the wholerange of f. Thus the wild-type phenotype in the SPN model is
much more robust to perturbations to the expression of SLP in the
posterior cell (SLP
4~1), than to perturbations to its inhibition in
the anterior cell (SLP 1~0).
With the parameters chosen, the disruption of SLP 2~0leads to
a remarkable similar behaviour: any disruption (any amount ofnoise) leads to the same wild-type variant attractor pattern withtwo wingless stripes (c). Therefore, SLP
2~0is not robust at all –
though the resulting attractor is always the same and a variant of
wild-type. In this case, convergence to a single attractor for allvalues of fis the result of setting m~500 in our experiments.
When we lower the value of menough in our simulations, for low
values of f, there are trials that are not perturbed and thus
maintain convergence to the wild-type attractor. But any

wild-type variant.
Disruption of hh2,4~0increasingly drives dynamics to the
broad-stripes mutant. However, disruption of hh2reveals greater
robustness since a large number of trials still converges to wild-typeforfƒ0:15, and residual convergence to wild-type is observed up
tof~0:75. In contrast, any disruption of hh
4above f~0:05leads
to the broad-stripes mutant, and even very small amounts of
disruption lead to a large proportion of mutants. Similarly,disruption of e:ptc
1~0drives the dynamics to one – and the
same – of the wild-type variants. Yet, when f~0:02there is aminute proportion of trajectories that still converge to the wild-
type attractor. Therefore, as expected, the wild-type attractor inthe SPN model is not very robust to disruptions of the enputs withfull power. Finally, and in contrast, no disruption of low-powerenput CI

attractor.

model networks of biochemical regulation and signalling. We do
this by generalizing the concept of canalization , which becomes
synonymous with redundancy in the logic of automata. The two-symbol schemata we propose capture two forms of logicalredundancy, and therefore of canalization: input redundancyand symmetry. This allowed us to provide a straightforward way
toquantify canalization of individual automata (micro-level), and to
integrate the entire canalizing logic of an automata network intothe Dynamics Canalization Map (DCM). A great merit of theDCM is that it allows us to make inferences about collective(macro-level) dynamics of networks from the micro-level canaliz-ing logic of individual automata – with incomplete information.
This is important because even medium-sized automata models of
biochemical regulation lead to dynamical landscapes that are toolarge to compute. In contrast, the DCM scales linearly withnumber of automata – and schema redescription, based oncomputation of prime implicants – is easy to compute forindividual automata with the number of inputs typically used in
the literature.
With this methodology, we are thus providing a method to link
micro- to macro-level dynamics – a crux of complexity. Indeed, inthis paper we showed how to uncover dynamical modularity : separable
building blocks of macro-level dynamics. This an entirely distinct
concept from community structure in networks, and allows us tostudy complex networks with node dynamics – rather than just theirconnectivity structure. The identification of such modules in thedynamics of networks is entirely novel and provides insight as to
how the collective dynamics of biochemical networks uses these
building blocks to produce its phenotypic behaviour – towards thegoal of explaining how biochemical networks ‘compute’.
By basing our methodology on the redescription of individual
automata (micro-level), we also avoid the scaling problems faced
by previous schemata approaches which focused solely on
redescription of the dynamical landscape (macro-level) of networks[52]. By implementing the DCM as a threshold network, we showthat we can compute the dynamical behaviour of the originalautomata network from information about the state of just a few
network nodes (partial information). In its original formulation, the
dynamic unfolding of an automata network cannot be computedunless an initial state of all its nodes is specified. In turn, this allowsus to search for minimal conditions (MCs) that guaranteeconvergence to an attractor of interest. Not only are MCsimportant to understand how to control complex network dynamics,
but they also allow us to quantify macro-level canalization therein.
From this, we get a measurable understanding of the robustness ofattractors of interest – the greater the canalization, the greater therobustness to random perturbations – and, conversely, theidentification of critical node-states (enputs) in the network dynamics
to those attractors. We provided a measure of the capacity of these
critical nodes to control convergence to an attractor of interest
(enput power), and studied their robustness to disruptions. Byquantifying the ability of individual nodes to control attractorbehaviour, we can obtain a testable understanding of macro-levelcanalization in the analysed biochemical network. Indeed, we can
uncover how robust phenotypic traits are (e.g. robustness of the
wild-type attractor), and which critical nodes must be acted uponin order to disrupt phenotypic behaviour.
We exemplified our methodology with the well-known segment
polarity network model (in both the single-cell and the spatialversions). Because this model has been extensively studied, we use it
to show that our analysis does not contradict any previous findings.
However, our analysis also allowed us to gain new knowledge aboutits behaviour. From a better understanding of the size of its wild-type attractor basin (larger than previously thought) to uncoveringnew minimal conditions and critical nodes that control wild-typebehaviour. We also fully quantified micro- and macro-levelcanalization in the model, and provided a complete map of itscanalization logic including dynamical modularity. Naturally, ourresults pertain to this model; we do not claim that our resultscharacterize the real Drosophila segment polarity gene network.However, our results, should they be found to deviate fromorganism studies, can certainly be used to improve the currentmodel, and thus improve our understanding of Drosophiladevelopment. Thus a key use of our methodology in systemsbiology should be to help improve modelling accuracy. With themethodology now tested on this model, in subsequent work we willapply it to several automata network models of biochemicalregulation and signalling available in the systems biology literature.
The pathway modules we derived by inspection of the DCM for
the segment polarity network revealed a number of properties ofcomplex networks dynamics that deserve further study. Forinstance, the dynamical sequence that occurs once each suchmodule is activated is independent of the temporal update schemeutilized. Therefore, if the dynamics of a network is capturedexclusively by such modules, its intra-module behaviour will besimilar for both synchronous and asynchronous updating –denoting a particular form of robustness to timing. We willexplore this property in future work, but as we showed here, thedynamics of the single-cell version of the SPN model is very(though not fully) controlled by only two pathway modules. Thisexplains why its dynamical behaviour is quite robust to timingevents as previously reported [38].
Research in cellular processes has provided a huge amount of
genomic, proteomic, and metabolomics data used to characterizenetworks of biochemical reactions. All this information opens thepossibility of understanding complex regulation of intra- and inter-cellular processes in time and space. However, this possibility is notyet realized because we do not understand the dynamicalconstraints that arise at the phenome (macro-) level from micro-level interactions. One essential step towards reaching theseambitious goals is to identify and understand the loci of control inthe dynamics of complex networks that make up living cells.Towards this goal, we developed the new methodology presentedin this paper. Our methodology is applicable to any complexnetwork that can be modelled using binary state automata – andeasily extensible to multiple-state automata. We currently focusonly on biochemical regulation with the goal of understanding thepossible mechanisms of collective information processing that maybe at work in orchestrating cellular activity.

Lineage fate decisions of hematopoietic cells depend on intrinsic factors and
extrinsic signals provided by the bone marrow microenvironment, where they reside.
Abnormalities in composition and function of hematopoietic niches have been proposed
as key contributors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) progression. Our previous
experimental ﬁndings strongly suggest that pro-inﬂammatory cues contribute to
mesenchymal niche abnormalities that result in maintenance of ALL precursor cells
at the expense of normal hematopoiesis. Here, we propose a molecular regulatory
network interconnecting the major communication pathways between hematopoietic
stemandprogenitorcells(HSPCs)andmesenchymalstromalcells(MSCs)withintheBM.
Dynamicalanalysisof the network as a Booleanmodel revealstwostationary statesthat
can be interpreted as the intercellular contact status. Furthermore, simulations describe
the molecular patterns observed during experimental proliferation and activation.
Importantly, our model predicts instability in the CXCR4/CXCL12 and VLA4/VCAM1
interactions following microenvironmental perturbation due by temporal signaling from
Toll like receptors (TLRs) ligation. Therefore, aberrant expression of NF-κB induced
by intrinsic or extrinsic factors may contribute to create a tumor microenvironment
where a negative feedback loop inhibiting CXCR4/CXCL12 and VLA4/VCAM1 cellular
communication axes allows for the maintenance of malignant cells.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is currently considered as a global child health priority ( Gupta et al., 2014). The
a
pplication of eﬀective treatments to decrease overall childhood cancer mortality requires a
comprehensive understanding of its origins and pathobiology, along with accurate diagnosis and
early identiﬁcation of high-risk groups (reviewed in Vilchis-Ordoñez et al., 2016). Strikingly, the

et al., 2015; Tomasetti and Vogelstein, 2015 ). Furthermore,
stochastic eﬀects associated with the number of stem cell
divisions have been proposed as major contributors, often eve n
more signiﬁcant than hereditary or external factors ( Tomasetti
andVogelstein,2015 ).
B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is largely the
resultofagrowingnumberofcooperatinggeneticandepigenet ic
aberrations that corrupt hematopoietic developmental pathway s
and ultimate lead to uncontrolled production of malignant
B lymphoid precursor cells within the bone marrow (BM)
(Pelayo et al., 2012; Purizaca et al., 2012 ). Leukemic cell
inﬁltration and treatment failure worsen the outcome of the
disease and remain the foremost cause of relapse. Recent
advances suggest the ability of leukemia initiating cells t o create
abnormalBMmicroenvironments,promotinghighproliferation
and early diﬀerentiation arrest at the expense of normal cell
fate decisions ( Colmone et al., 2008; Raaijmakers, 2011; Vilchis-

(Wu et al., 2009 ), culminating in the displacement of the
latter,asobservedinxenotransplantationmicemodels( Colmone
et al., 2008 ). Moreover, the marrow microenvironment provides
leukemic precursors with dynamic interactions and regulato ry
signals that are essential for their maintenance, proliferat ion
and survival. Although, the underlying molecular mechanis ms
are poorly deﬁned, these niches protect tumor cells from
chemotherapy-inducedapoptosis,showinganewperspectiveon
the evolution of chemoresistance ( Ayala et al., 2009 :Shain et al.,
2015; Tabe and Konopleva, 2015 ), and emphasizing the need
for new models that theoretically or experimentally replicate the
interplay between tumor and stromal cells under normal and
pathologicalsettings.
As suggested by our previous ﬁndings, ALL lymphoid
precursors have the ability of responding to pathogen- or
damage- associated molecular patterns via Toll-like receptor
signaling by secreting soluble factors and altering their
diﬀerentiation potentials ( Dorantes-Acosta et al., 2013 ). The
resultingpro-inﬂammatorymicroenvironmentmayexposethem
to prolonged proliferation, contributing tumor maintenance
in a self-sustaining way while prompting the NF- κB-associated
proliferation of normal progenitor cells ( Vilchis-Ordoñez
et al., 2015, 2016 ). Some hematopoietic growth factors and
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, including granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor (G-CSF), IFN α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-7, and TNF α
were highly produced by ALL cells from a conspicuous group ofpatients co-expressing myeloid markers ( Vilchis-Ordoñez et al.,
2015). Of note, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from ALL
BMhaveshownatypicalproductionofpro-inﬂammatoryfactors
whereas disruption of the major cell communication pathway
is apparent by detriment of CXCL12 expression and biological
function ( Geay et al., 2005; Colmone et al., 2008; van den Berk
etal.,2014 ).
Considering that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis constitutes the
most critical component of the perivascular and reticular BM
niches supporting the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
(HSPCs) diﬀerentiation and maintenance within the BM, as
well as the early steps of B cell development ( Ma et al., 1998;
Tokoyoda et al., 2004; Sugiyama et al., 2006; Greenbaum et al .,
2013), an obstruction of the HSPC-MSC interaction may have

arecurrentlytopicalquestions.
Mathematical model strategies have become powerful
approaches to complex biological systems and may contribute
to unravel the hematopoietic-microenvironment interplay
that facilitates tumor cells prevalence ( Altrock et al., 2015;
Enciso et al., 2015 ). Through continuous dynamic modeling
with diﬀerential equations we have learned seminal aspects
of multi-compartment and multi-clonal behavior of leukemic
cell populations ( Stiehl and Marciniak-Czochra, 2012; Enciso
et al., 2015 ), leading to novel proposals on disease development
driven by unbalanced competition between normal and pre-
leukemic cells ( Swaminathan et al., 2015 ). Both stochastic and
deterministic models have been useful to simulate cell fate
decisions and predict clonal evolution (reviewed in Enciso et al.,
2015). Certainly, incorporating tumor microenvironment in
cancermodelingisexpectedtochangeourvisionofbiochemica l
interactions in niche remodeling-dependent hematopoietic
growth, as recently demonstrated for myeloma disease ( Coelho
etal.,2016 ).
By developing and simulating a dynamic Boolean
system, we now investigate the biological consequences of
microenvironmental perturbation due by temporal TLR
signaling on crucial communication networks between
stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and MSCs in ALL. We propose
that NF- κB dependent tumor-associated inﬂammation co-
participate in malignant progression concomitant to normal
hematopoietic failure through disruption of CXCL12/CXCR4
andVLA4/VCAM-1communicationaxes.

interest was the attention to the hematopoietic malignancie s,
which in contrast to solid tumors, display a distinct CXCL12-
mediated microenvironmental behavior. Thus, although the
modeled signaling pathways could be considered generic to al l
tissues, the organ, stage of cell diﬀerentiation and surroun ding
microenvironment may inﬂuence the net result of interactio ns.
Taking into account this considerations, most published wor k
that has been used for the reconstruction of our proposed
model, include data from molecular interactions in HSPCs.
Some of the interactions have been reported in a number
of diﬀerent tissues and predicted to be conserved in the
hematopoietic system. Finally, as there is not enough data
to model hematopoietic-microenvironment restricted to Homo
sapiensandsomeinteractionsmightbecrucialforthemolecular
connectivity of the model, we have used information from
diﬀerent species when needed. A detailed referencing of all
reports used for the model reconstruction is provided as
SupplementalMaterial(TablesS1,S2,andreferencelist).
Molecular Basis for the Network
Reconstruction
The connectivity among key molecules involved in the
communication between HSPCs and MSCs within the BM
was inferred through the curated experimental literature.
Speciﬁcally, we were interested in recovering the network
components,theirinteractions,andthenatureoftheintera ctions
(activation/positive or inactivation/negative). The resu lting
general network incorporates transcriptional factors, kina ses,
membranereceptors,interleukines,integrins,growthfact ors,and
chemokines from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus species.
Importantly, to simplify the modeling process, some groups
of molecules were considered as single functional modules,
thus encompassing a series of sequential steps that lead to the
activation or inactivation of a certain node (e.g., PI3K/Ak t).
The following paragraphs summarize the principle evidence
used to reconstruct the HSPC-MSC network and infer the
logical rules for computational simulation of the system as a
discrete dynamical model. A detailed referencing is provide d as
SupplementalMaterial(TablesS1,S2,andreferencelist).
The CXCR4/CXCL12 chemokine pathway was considered as
the central axis for the network construction considering i ts
essentialroleinhomeostasismaintenance( Sugiyamaetal.,2006;
Tzeng et al., 2011 ) and B lineage support ( Ma et al., 1998;
Tokoyodaetal.,2004 ).Furthermore,recentobservationssuggest
that this axis is disrupted by up-stream molecular deregulati ons
both in MSC and leukemic blasts harvested from ALL patients,
aﬀecting the maintenance of hematopoietic cells within their
regulatory niches ( Geay et al., 2005; Colmone et al., 2008; van
den Berk et al., 2014 ). Besides the well-studied CXCR4/CXCL12
chemotactic interaction, CXCR4 activation increases the aﬃ nity
between vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)
expressed on the surface of MSC and its receptor VLA-4 on
HSPC. Both pathways, CXCR4/CXCL12 and VLA-4/VCAM-1,

Ramirez et al., 2009 ), converge in triggering the PI3K/Akt andERK signals, and share common up-stream regulators involving
molecularfactorsguidinginﬂammatoryresponses.
As mentioned in the Introduction, recent evidence indicate s
the secretion of high levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
by a conspicuous group of ALL patients ( Vilchis-Ordoñez
et al., 2015 ), thereby presumably contributing to remodeling of
the normal hematopoietic microenvironment ( Colmone et al.,
2008). Of note, interleukin-1 α(IL-1α) and IL-1 β, which were
substantiallyelevated,playanampliﬁcationroleoninﬂammat ion
increasing the expression of other cytokines, like G-CSF
(Majumdar et al., 2000; Allakhverdi et al., 2013 ), and setting
a positive feedback loop with the PI3K co-activation of NF-
κB (Reddy et al., 1997; Sizemore et al., 1999; Carrero et al.,
2012; Bektas et al., 2014 ). IL-1 and G-CSF, inhibit directly and
indirectly the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. G-CSF negatively regulate s
CXCL12 transcription and increases the secretion of matrix
metalloproteinase-9,showingtheabilitytodegradebothCX CL12
(Lévesque et al., 2003; Semerad et al., 2005; Christopher et al. ,
2009; Day et al., 2015 ) and CXCR4 ( Lévesque et al., 2003 ).
Moreover, G-CSF promotes up-regulation of Gﬁ1 that at the
time inhibits the transcription of CXCR4 ( Zhuang et al., 2006;
De La Luz Sierra et al., 2007; de la Luz Sierra et al., 2010 ).
Thus, by considering this information from experimental dat a,
we have included IL-1 and G-CSF as key elements of the BM
microenvironmentintheHSPC-MSCcommunicationnetwork.
In concordance, we incorporated as a “positive control
condition” an input node representing the Toll-like receptor
ligand (lTLR) lipopolysaccharide (LPS), that binds TLR4
and triggers the conventional and well-known NF- κB-
dependent pro-inﬂammatory response, promoting, among
other transcriptional targets, the transcription of pro-IL-1 β
(Jones et al., 2001; Tak and Firestein, 2001; Wang et al., 2002;
Khandanpouretal.,2010;Higashikunietal.,2013 ).
Downstream NF- κB, the expression of CXCR7 has been
shown to be upregulated ( Tarnowski et al., 2010 ), which in
turn, down-regulates CXCR4 by heterodimerization, promotin g
its internalization and further degradation. In parallel, a ctivated
CXCR7 presents a higher aﬃnity for CXCL12 and β-arrestin,
reducing CXCR4 signaling in CXCR7 and CXCR4 expressing
cells (Uto-Konomi et al., 2013; Coggins et al., 2014 ). However,
CXCR7isunabletocouplewithG-protein,transducingthrough
recruitment of β-arrestin and leading to MAP kinases Akt and
ERK activation ( Tarnowski et al., 2010; Uto-Konomi et al.,
2013; Torossian et al., 2014 ). As with CXCR4, CXCR7, and
VLA-4 activation in HSPC, PI3K/Akt pathway is activated on
HSPC and MSC, via G-CSF receptor signaling ( Liu et al., 2007;
Vagima et al., 2009; Ponte et al., 2012; Furmento et al., 2014 ),
and after LPS stimulation ( Guha and Mackman, 2002; Wang
et al., 2009; McGuire et al., 2013 ). Apparently, PI3K/Akt acts
at overlapping levels on the modulation of inﬂammation. On
the one hand, it increases the production of IL-1 antagonist
molecules ( Williams et al., 2004; Molnarﬁ et al., 2005; Li and
Smith, 2014 ) and inhibits secretion of mature IL-1 β(Tapia-
Abellán et al., 2014 ). On the other hand, it promotes nuclear
translocation of the transcriptional factor Foxo3a ( Brunet et al.,
1999; Miyamoto et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008 ), down-regulating

ABSTRACT
Motivation: Cell migration is a complex process that is controlled
through the time-sequential feedback regulation of protein signallingand gene regulation. Based on prior knowledge and ownexperimental data, we developed a large-scale dynamic networkdescribing the onset and maintenance of hepatocyte growth factor-induced migration of primary human keratinocytes. We appliedBoolean logic to capture the qualitative behaviour as well as short-and long-term dynamics of the complex signalling network involvedin this process, comprising protein signalling, gene regulation andautocrine feedback.Results: A Boolean model has been compiled from time-resolved
transcriptome data and literature mining, incorporating the mainpathways involved in migration from initial stimulation to phenotypeprogress. Steady-state analysis under different inhibition andstimulation conditions of known key molecules reproduces existingdata and predicts novel interactions based on our own experiments.Model simulations highlight for the ﬁrst time the necessity of atemporal sequence of initial, transient MET receptor (met proto-oncogene, hepatocyte growth factor receptor) and subsequent,continuous epidermal growth factor/integrin signalling to trigger andsustain migration by autocrine signalling that is integrated throughthe Focal adhesion kinase protein. We predicted in silico and veriﬁed
in vitro that long-term cell migration is stopped if any of the two
feedback loops are inhibited.Availability: The network ﬁle for analysis with the R BoolNet library

1 INTRODUCTION
Cell migration and wound healing are complex cellular
processes that involve keratinocytes, ﬁbroblasts, blood vessels andinﬂammatory cells (Xue et al. , 2007). Keratinocyte migration
plays an important role in re-epithelialization and wound healing(Hunt et al. , 2000), which is a multistep cellular process by the

2001; Werner et al. , 2007). The precise regulation of cell migration
in its temporal sequence, activation and de-activation is crucial fortissue homeostasis. In its aberrant form, it can lead to scar formation(Heng, 2011) and has critical implications to cancer metastasisformation (Schäfer and Werner, 2008).
Different growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-beta(TGF- β), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and ﬁbroblast growth
factor (FGF) that activate and regulate cell migration have beenextensively studied in many cell types (Birchmeier et al. , 2003;
Hudson and McCawley, 1998; Jaakkola et al. , 1998; Pastore et al. ,
2008; Tsuboi et al. , 1993). These growth factors have been found to
overlap with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways(Cho and Klemke, 2000; Kain and Klemke, 2001; Klemke et al. ,
1997).
HGF interacts and activates MET receptor (Bottaro et al. ,
1991) to induce context-dependent several cellular processes suchas proliferation, cell movement or morphogenic differentiation(Brinkmann et al. , 1995; Clague, 2011; Jeffers et al. , 1996; Medico
et al. , 1996). Herein, we focus on HGF-induced migration of primary
normal human keratinocytes (NHK).
Although there is vast literature concerning HGF-induced
keratinocyte migration and MET receptor dynamics, the dynamicinterplay of initial MET receptor regulation and subsequentautocrine regulation that initiate, sustain and control cell migrationremain poorly understood. Based on time-resolved transcriptomedata of NHK after HGF stimulation, we have previously inferred agene regulatory model describing the decision process of NHK cellstowards migration (Busch et al. , 2008). From the model analysis it
was evident that several pathways coordinate their action to initiateand sustain cell migration upon initial HGF stimulation: migration isstarted through the AP-1 system and maintained after MET receptorinternalization (Clague, 2011) by autocrine signalling through EGFreceptor (EGFR) and urokinase plasminogen activator surfacereceptor (uPAR) (Schnickmann et al. , 2009). The model predicted
qualitatively how the temporal sequence of transient MET receptoractivation and subsequent long-term EGF receptor activity sustainedthe migratory phenotype. However, as the model was based ontranscriptome data alone, there was no mechanistic explanationof the observed processes. A model combining transcriptome datawith mechanistic protein signalling has been missing so far. Amajor obstacle in building such a model lies in the different timescales involved in the process of cell migration. In general, thetranscriptome response changes over several hours, while proteinsignalling pathways become active within minutes upon receptor

stimulation (Mesecke et al. , 2011). Capturing all necessary and
sufﬁcient events on the protein signalling level, including kineticparameters, is close to impossible by current biological technology.
To link our prior transcriptome-based model with protein
signalling pathways, we present a Boolean network model of HGF-induced keratinocyte migration. The Boolean approach allows toderive important functional properties and predictions without theneed for detailed quantitative kinetic data and parameters. In thepast, the approach has been successfully applied for diverse systemssuch as gene regulatory networks (Albert and Othmer, 2003; Chaveset al. , 2005), models of ﬂoral morphogenesis (Mendoza et al. , 1999),
mammalian cell cycle (Mendoza, 2006), EGFR signalling (Samagaet al. , 2009) or apoptosis (Schlatter et al. , 2009).To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst model for HGF-induced
keratinocyte migration that incorporates protein signalling, generegulation and autocrine feedback, following cellular dynamicsfrom initial stimulation to the execution of the phenotype. Toobtain the dynamical behaviour reproducing literature knowledgeand our own experimental data, we include several time scales inthe model mimicking the fast activation of downstream signallingof MET, MAPK/ERK and p38/JNK pathways, as well as theslow transcriptome response and subsequent autocrine activationof EGFR and uPA receptors, all of which are necessary to sustaincell migration after MET receptor internalization. Speciﬁcally, froma logical steady-state analysis, we show that priming of the HGF–MET receptor system is necessary for continued autocrine regulation

through EGFR and integrins, sustaining the MAPK/ERK activity.
More importantly, we predicted and showed experimentally, that theinhibition of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), or serpinE1, a serine protease inhibitor, stops cell migration only beyond 1 hof stimulation, when autocrine signalling loops through uPA/uPARbecome important and after the ﬁrst wave of protein signalling andtranscriptional response.
2 METHODS
2.1 Reconstruction of the NHK migration model
A Boolean network, comprising protein signalling pathway, gene expression
dynamics and autocrine feedback was constructed based on our previousgene regulatory model for keratinocyte migration (Busch et al. , 2008).
There, time-resolved gene expression data of NHK were recorded at t=
[0h,1h,2h,3h,4h,6h,8h]after stimulation with HGF (ArrayExpress ID:
E-TABM-440). As a basis for our HGF-induced cell migration network,we chose genes that have either a large differential response after HGFstimulation or genes that are known to be functionally related to cellmigration. Genes ﬁnally included in the model are depicted in Figure2A. To link immediate early and late responding genes to initial METreceptor signalling and subsequent protein pathways, respectively, weintegrated differentially expressed genes with signalling pathways knownfrom literature. Additional pathways for the HGF migration networkwere identiﬁed through the commercial IPA (Ingenuity Systems; www.
ingenuity.com ) software. A dataset containing gene identiﬁers and
corresponding expression values was uploaded into the application. Eachgene kinetic was mapped to its corresponding object in the IngenuityKnowledge Base. The above identiﬁed molecules were overlaid onto a globalmolecular network developed from information contained in the application.
This generated a score with meaningful and signiﬁcant networks, biological
functions and the canonical pathways based on the Fisher exact test.
2.2 The NHK migration model as a dynamic
Boolean model
We used a Boolean model framework to construct a dynamic, temporally
discrete model for NHK migration. Each node ycan take the values 0 or 1,
representing either the present/absent or inactive/active, i.e. phosphorylated,state of the protein or gene. The network state is represented by the vectorwith the set of Boolean variables Y={y
1,y2,..., yn}, where yidenotes the
state of the ith node. The state of activation of each node changes according
to the transition function F={f1,f2,..., fn}. The next state of the network
Y(t+1) changes in discrete time steps according to yi(t+1)=fi{x(t)}.
We simulated the Boolean network under synchronous update using the R
BoolNet library (Müssel et al. , 2010). As we consider both protein signalling
and gene regulation, two time scales were included in the model. Rapidprotein modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation can thereby be separated fromlong-term effects, transcriptional changes, protein synthesis and autocrinesignalling. Time-scale separation was done by ﬁrst introducing a referencetime through the transcriptome kinetics and equating the time of maximal foldchange of the respective genes with their switching-on time. Consequently,our model contains two time scales: 0–1 and 1–3 h (marked as 1 and 3,respectively), denoting the time intervals after HGF stimulation, duringwhich the reactions can be switched on the earliest. These represent theearly HGF downstream signalling and ﬁrst transcriptional response as wellas the autocrine feedback, which are both necessary to trigger and sustaincell migration.
The reference publications from which the interactions have been inferred
as well as their Boolean transition functions and time windows are listed inthe Supplementary Table S1.2.3 Cell culture
Normal human skin keratinocytes (NHK) were derived from foreskinepidermis and cultivated in keratinocyte serum free medium (KSFM;Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as previously described (Busch et al. , 2008).
Cells were kept under a humidiﬁed environment with 5% CO
2and 37◦C.
NHK up to Passages 4–5 were used in all experiments of this study. Cellswere treated as described bellow and collected after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 htreatment for expression proﬁling.
2.4 Scratch assay
Monolayer scratch assays were used to evaluate migration of NHKas described before (Busch et al. , 2008). Brieﬂy, cells were grown
to conﬂuence in ibidi μ-dish containing culture inserts (ibidi, Munich,
Germany) and treated with mitomycin c 10 μg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 3 h before stimulation. Cells were stimulated with10 ng/mL HGF (Sigma-Aldrich) and/or 25 μM Tiplaxtinin, a PAI-1 inhibitor
(Axon Medchem, Groningen, Netherlands). Time-lapse microscopy of cellmigration was recorded using the Perfect Focus Systems , every 30 min up to24 h, on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a Digital Sight DS-QiMc (NikonInstruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan), coupled to an ibidi-heating chamber.
2.5 Cell migration assay
Keratinocyte migration was analysed with an independent second technique,so-called xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analyzer DP (Roche Diagnostics).
The speciﬁc migration CIM-plates were ﬁlled with medium and the
respective stimulus/inhibitor as described above. NHK were seeded (6 ×10
4
cells/well) into the top chamber wells of the CIM-plate according to the
manufacturer instructions. Cell migration was monitored every 15 min forup to 24 h by changes of the impedance signal of the cells that crossed themembrane from the top to the bottom chamber. For analysis of migration, thearea under the curve was measured for the ﬁrst 8 h. The data were expressedas the mean ±SD of quadruplicates in three independent experiments.
Differences were assessed by the Student t-test for unpaired samples and
aP-value <0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant.
2.6 Western blot
NHK were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche), and later diluted in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were electrophoresedon 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, transferredto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes, and immunoblotted with antibodiesto total p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Cell Signalling #9102), phospho p44/42MAPK (pERK1/2) (Cell Signalling #9101), total FAK (Cell Signalling#3285), phospho-FAK (Tyr925) (Cell Signalling #3284) overnight at4

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Upon stimulation with HGF keratinocytes start to migrate
collectively. Several points of interference that modulatekeratinocyte migration have been previously identiﬁed. However,time sequential orchestration of the whole-cell signalling remainsunclear so far. Our goal is to understand how downstream signallingof the HGF-activated MET receptor is translated into a sustainedmigratory behaviour. To accomplish this, we developed a Booleannetwork model of the combined MAPK signalling pathways, generegulation and autocrine feedback, which links known interactionsof downstream protein and gene targets of MET with subsequentchanges in the cellular homeostasis.
3.1 Boolean network model properties
The keratinocyte migration model is a logical interaction hypergraph
connected by logic gates. It comprises 66 nodes, excluding the drainnodes and 66 interactions (Fig. 1), integrating the main pathways andgenes known to be involved in HGF-induced keratinocyte migration.For detailed information about the biological processes and contextfrom which the model was derived, please confer to Supplementary
Table S1.
There are two input nodes, the MET receptor, stimulated through
HGF, as well as EGFR, stimulated by HBEGF. Both receptorshave been shown to be involved in keratinocyte migration in a
time-sequential manner (Busch et al. , 2008). Four further nodes
are included to applying external interventions: PAI-1, AKAP12,DUSP1 and PTEN. AKAP12 and DUSP1 are not included inthe calculation of the steady-state below. Despite the fact thatthey are found to be up-regulated on the transcriptome level, therespective proteins seem to exert a stabilizing negative feedbackfunction (Legewie et al. , 2008), not completely inhibiting their
speciﬁc targets, but allowing for a rapid protein induction (Blüthgen,2010). In line with this, we ﬁnd akap12 strongly up-regulated
in HGF-induced keratinocyte migration (Fig. 2A), although over-expression of akap12 has been associated with reduced motility
(Gelman, 2010).ABoolean representation of such negative feedbackbehaviour is not straight forward and will often lead to — abiologically questionable — oscillatory steady state. Hence, weincluded the proteins for completeness, yet excluded it from steady-state analysis.
3.2 Dynamics of the Boolean network model for
migration
To search for steady-state attractors of the Boolean network model,
we randomly initialized all network nodes, except for HGF/PAI-1and AKAP12/PTEN with either 0 or 1 and performed synchronousstate transitions until a simple attractor was reached. Activating thenodes HGF and PAI-1 to 1 mimicked HGF stimulation and allowedfor autocrine feedback through uPAR signalling. Setting AKAP12and PTEN to zero excluded their inhibitory effects. Samplingover n=10
7random initialization of the network we ﬁnd only
one attractor of the network with the node CELL MIGRATIONswitched on. Although only a minor fraction of all possible

suggestive of a robust response irrespective of the initial networkstate, i.e. cell migration follows upon MET receptor activation andsubsequent autocrine signalling.
In detail node and pathway activity moves along the following
steps after transient MET receptor signalling: (i) the ﬁrst andnecessary input into the network towards migration is thestimulation with HGF, which immediately and speciﬁcally activatesthe MET receptor. Within the ﬁrst hour, the signal activatesthree different downstream pathways, PLC/PKC, MAPK/ERKand PI3K (grey boxes, Fig. 1); (ii) ERK phosphorylationactivates transcriptional responses, leading to the down-regulationof proliferation and activates, together with p38/JNK, essentialcytokines and transcription factors for migration within the ﬁrsthour, such as HBEGF, IL8 and ATF2, as well as cJUN andcFOS, respectively. HBEGF has been shown to mediate thesubsequent autocrine activation of EGFR (Busch et al. , 2008); (iii)
The activation of cJUN and cFOS nodes leads to an initiation
of the AP-1 system, which in turn stimulates the uPA/uPARsignalling pathway by activation of the uPAR, triggering theformation from plasminogen activator to plasmin. According tothe transcriptome kinetics, the uPA/uPAR pathway becomes active2 h after HGF stimulation, being controlled by PAI-1.

Together with activated EGFR this protein sustainsPLC/PKC, MAPK and PI3K activity similar to the initial HGF/METactivation.

activity is not required for keratinocyte migration beyond 1.5 h after
stimulation (Busch et al. , 2008). Accordingly, the model suggests
that continued PI3K up-regulation can only occur through thecombined activity of integrin and EGFR signalling in the presenceof FAK. Signalling continues through AKT, DOCK1 and RAS tosustain RAC1/CDC42 activity, which result in the downstreamactivity of p21 protein (CDC42/RAC)-activated kinases (PAKs),mitogen-activated kinase kinases (MKK) and ﬁnally activation ofJNK/p38. This closes the autocrine loop through time sequentiallyactivated external receptors. This late response of the keratinocytemigration network through activation of uPAR, integrins and EGFRtriggers similar pathways as the MET signalling, but furthermoreresults in the prolonged activation of PLC/PKC, MAPK/ERK, PI3K,RAC1/CDC42 and JNK/p38 pathways to sustain the long-termmigration response.
Figure 2B shows a simulation of the network dynamics after
HGF stimulation up to 3 h, as marked by the white verticalgaps, having initialized all network nodes, except for HGF with0 for clarity. The transitions towards the ﬁnal steady states areindicated in arbitrary time units. Clearly, an activation wave ofthe three downstream pathways PLC/PKC, MAPK/ERK and PI3Kis evident, resulting in the up-regulation of the respective targetgenes (Fig. 2A), the AP-1 system and starting cell migration within1 h. In the following 2 h, autocrine signalling loops activate EGFRand integrin signalling through HBEGF and uPAR, respectively.Switching off the MET receptor has no inﬂuence on the steadystate at this time, and cell migration continues. Switching offeither uPA/uPAR signalling through PAI-1 or inhibiting EGFR stopsmigration through subsequent switching off all pathways.
Table 1 lists the steady states of the Boolean network under
different input settings and/or different scenarios. Interestingly, themodel predicts that cells will migrate only when HGF signallingprimes the cells, followed by EGFR and integrin signalling. This isin line with our previous ﬁndings, which now can be explained onthe causal level of protein signalling.
Lastly, we note that our model still has limitations predicting
the correct long-term behaviour for transiently activated genes suchasegr1 ,il8,ctgf orccl20 . Although the model captures the long-
term cell migration response and upstream pathway activity, it doesnot yet include a negative feedback down-regulating of these genes(compare Fig. 2A and B). Although the biological consequences ofthe transient gene activation remain unclear so far, this divergencebetween the model steady-state behaviour and experimental databeyond 3 h need to be addressed in more detail in the future.
Model simulation clearly reﬂects the necessity for the time
sequential pathway activation, shown by the early and latesteady state after 1 and 3 h, respectively. Initial HGF/METreceptor signalling triggers, while subsequent integrin/EGF receptorsignalling sustains MAPK/ERK, PI3K, PLC/PKC and JNK/p38signalling (Fig. 3C). Model simulations further predict thatcontinued migration depends on both EGFR and integrin signalling.Failure of either one causes the down-regulation of the FAK proteinand subsequent PI3K, MAPK/ERK and p38/JNK pathways (Fig.2, Columns d and e). Indeed, we have previously shown thedependency of cell migration on sustained EGFR activity after METsignalling pathway activation (Busch et al. , 2008).
To experimentally validate the long-term dependency of NHK
on the FAK protein-mediated integrin signalling, we interrupt theuPA/uPAR signalling pathway through inhibition of PAI-1. In linewith previous ﬁndings (Providence and Higgins, 2004) and predicted
from our network simulation, long-term, but not immediate cellmigration should be decreased. A scratch assay (Fig. 3A) showsa signiﬁcant decrease with the usage of the PAI-1 inhibitor(Tiplaxtinin) in migration when compared with control conditions.
While under HGF stimulation, the scratch is almost closed after
8 h, hardly any cell movement is detected under additional PAI-1inhibitor treatment. The delayed impact of PAI-1 inhibition becomesevident from a real-time analysis of keratinocyte migration using thexCELLigence Cell Analyzer (Fig. 3B). Clearly, the migration speedbecomes strongly reduced after 2.5 h, in line with the suggestedrole for ‘late’ uPA/uPAR signalling pathway involvement, activatingFAK through integrin/EGFR signalling for sustained migration. Thistime point also coincides with the start of transcriptional activation ofPAI-1 (Fig. 2A), furthermore supporting the late involvement of thispathway. Interestingly, MET receptor and integrin/FAK pathwaysboth activate MAPK/ERK, PI3K and PLC/PKC, RAC1/CDC42and JNK/p38. However, while the former primes the cells towardsmigration, the impact of the latter on downstream pathways seemsto be much more pronounced. Analysing the phosphorylation stateof ERK (pERK) we observe an immediate and sustained increase ofpERK under HGF treatment in line with our simulation. Differencesin pERK level under simultaneous PAI-1 inhibition become mostapparent at late time points beyond 2 h, conﬁrming the modelpredictions of late impact of integrin signalling on ERK. Lookingat FAK as an up-stream effector of ERK (Sawhney et al. , 2006),
we ﬁnd similar activity for pFAK under HGF stimulation andPAI-1 inhibition. We observe a strong, but late increase in FAKactivity as determined from phosphorylation of the Y925 site ofFAK (pFAK (Y925)). Simultaneous stimulation of HGF and PAI-1inhibition decreases pFAK (Y925) when compared with HGF alone(Supplementary Fig. S1). Immediate increase of pFAK (Y925)suggests a possible role of FAK in the beginning of migration.Previous work has shown two distinct phases in FAK involvementfor wound healing in rat keratinocytes (Providence and Higgins,2004). There, the effect of PAI-1 inhibition became evident onlyafter 6 h and more into migration. Herein, we can possibly explainthe importance of FAK for prolonged migration through the timesequential regulation of uPA/uPAR, integrin and EGFR signallingpathways, which were predicted from network simulation and havebeen — in part — experimentally validated. Further studies fora better understanding of this complex pathway orchestration ofHGF-induced migration will be necessary, of course.
4 CONCLUSIONS
We have shown for the ﬁrst time a comprehensive model for
HGF-induced keratinocyte migration. The model comprises twotime scales and incorporates various signalling pathway criticallyinvolved in the initiation, sustaining and controlling of keratinocytemigration. Being mostly compiled from prior knowledge and vastliterature, it will lend itself to rapid hypothesis testing of key pointsof interference.
We are aware that the above model cannot capture the entire
complexity of this process. Most of the simulation results aresuggestive about the underlying process and further experimentswill need to be conducted to study the complex orchestration ofpathways leading to keratinocyte migration. However, our modelmakes several important and experimentally testable predictions

Abstract
The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in
diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported theinvolvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the
balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on
an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signallingnetwork, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understandtheir contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded
them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder
cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with thecombinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the
compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations
for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silicoexperiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cellfate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder
cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor
Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.

Introduction
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades can be
activated by a wide variety of stimuli, such as growth factors andenvironmental stresses. They affect diverse cellular activities,including gene expression, cell cycle machinery, apoptosis anddifferentiation.
A recurrent feature of a MAPK cascade is a central three-tiered
core signalling module, consisting of a set of sequentially actingkinases. MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) are activated follow-ing upstream signals. For instance, they can be phosphorylated bysmall G-proteins belonging to the Ras/Rho family in response toextracellular stimuli. Their activation leads to double phosphor-ylation and activation of downstream MAPK kinases (MAPKKs),which in turn double phosphorylate MAPKs. Once activated,MAPKs act on their target substrates, which include other kinasesand transcription factors [1]. To date, three main cascades havebeen extensively studied, named after their specific MAPKcomponents: Extracellular Regulated Kinases (ERK), Jun NH2Terminal Kinases (JNK), and p38 Kinases (p38). These cascadesare strongly interconnected, forming a complex molecular network
[1–4].
MAPK phosphorylation level is regulated by the opposing
actions of phosphatases. As the effects of MAPK signalling havebeen shown to depend on the magnitude and duration of kinaseactivation, phosphatase action might play an important functionalrole [5]. Moreover, scaffold proteins bring together the compo-nents of a MAPK cascade and protect them from activation byirrelevant stimuli, as well as from negative regulators (such asphosphatases) [6].
The involvement of MAPK cascades in major cellular processes
has been widely documented [1,7,8]. However, the wide range ofstimuli and the large number of processes regulated, coupled withthe complexity of the network, raises the fundamental and debatedquestion of how MAPK signalling specificity is achieved [9].Several interrelated mechanisms have been proposed: opposingaction of phosphatases; presence of multiple components withdifferent roles at each level of the cascade (e.g. different isoforms ofa protein); interaction with scaffold proteins; distinct sub-cellularlocalisations of cascade components and/or targets; feedback

mechanisms; great variety of molecular signals, as well as distinct
durations and strengths; cross-talks among signalling cascades that
are activated simultaneously [4,10]. All these factors contribute to
the complexity of the MAPK network and presumably act
together to determine signalling specificity.
Deregulations of the MAPK cascades are often observed in
cancer [11,12]. Several components of the network have already
been proposed as targets in cancer therapy, such as p38, JNK,
ERK, MEK, RAF, RAS, and DUSP1 [12–23], but the intricacy ofthe underlying mechanisms still hinders the conception of effective
drugs [24]. A deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms
involved is crucial to clarify the roles of MAPKs in cancer onset
and development, as well as to delineate therapeutic strategies.
During the last decades, mathematical modelling has been
widely used to study different aspects of the MAPK cascades [25]
(Table S1). Quantitative models (based on Ordinary DifferentialEquations – ODE) have been proposed to explain the main
dynamical properties of the MAPK cascades in relation with their
particular structural features (double phosphorylation events,
phosphatase effects, feedback loops, role of scaffold proteins,
etc.) [26–32]. Other modelling studies investigated the behaviour
of specific cascades (mainly ERK) leading to MAPK activation in
response to external stimuli [33–42]. More recently, comprehen-sive qualitative dynamical models have been developed. Samaga et
al. [43] built a large logical model of the signalling network
(including MAPKs) responding to Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) stimuli, which was largely derived from the
reaction map published by Oda et al. [44]. This model accurately
covers the early response of the MAPK cascades to signalling
stimuli, with a particular reference to primary and transformedhepatocytes. Also focusing on cancer (in particular, epithelial
tumours), the logical model proposed by Poltz and Naumann
recapitulates the response of a cell to DNA damaging agents (DNA
repair versus apoptotic cell death), and was used to identify
candidate target molecules to design novel therapies [45].
In this study, we aimed at better understanding how MAPK
signalling deregulations can interfere with tissue homeostasis,leading to imbalance between cell proliferation, on the one hand,and cell growth arrest, possibly followed by apoptotic cell death,
on the other hand. The choice between these phenotypes (cell fate
decision) is of vital importance in cancer progression: transformed
cells receive external and/or autocrine growth stimuli pushing
towards cell proliferation (i.e. tumour growth); but they alsoreceive external and/or internal anti-proliferative signals, which
coupled with apoptotic stimuli trigger transformed cell clearance
from the organism [46]. Our goal was to build a predictive
dynamical model able (i) to recapitulate the response of the entire
MAPK network to selected stimuli, along with its specific
contribution to cell fate decision, and (ii) to assess novel hypotheses
about poorly documented mechanisms involved in specific cancercell types. We focused on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK
network deregulations have been associated with specific pheno-
types.
Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among men
in Europe and America. Two main types of early stage bladder
carcinoma have been delineated so far: (i) non-invasive papillary
carcinomas (Ta) are usually mildly aggressive and rarely progress
towards higher stages, whereas (ii) carcinomas in situ (Cis) often
develop into invasive tumours (T1 to T4 stages) [47]. Activatingmutations of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) have
been found in 70–75% of Ta tumours, but they are absent in Cis
and less frequent (15–20%) in invasive tumours [47,48].
Oncogenic FGFR3 gene fusions have also been recently
identified in a small percentage of invasive bladder tumours
[49]. In contrast, over-expression of EGFR has been recurrently
associated with higher probability of tumour progression [50].The mechanisms underlying the cellular response of cancer cells
to these signalling stimuli are still poorly understood. Alterations
of p53 and retinoblastoma (RB) pathways are presumably
involved in tumour progression [51]. These pathways are major
controllers of the cell cycle, and the MAPK network presumably
regulates their activation by responding to growth factor stimuli.
For instance, ERK phosphorylation leads to MYC activation,which can inhibit cell cycle progression through the p14/p53
pathway [52], or activate Cyclin/CDK complexes leading to RB
phosphorylation and subsequent E2F-dependent gene transcrip-
tion [51].
Both EGFR and FGFR3 pathways can activate the MAPK
cascades. Although the two signalling pathways largely overlap,
the presence of specificity factors might contribute to tune the finalcellular response. To tackle these questions, we first compiled
published data to build a comprehensive generic reaction map
using CellDesigner software [53–55]. This map takes into account
signals propagating from major stimuli, such as growth factors,
cytokines, stress, leading to the activation of MAPKs and their
downstream targets, and consequently to cell fate decision. We
considered three main cell fates: proliferation, apoptosis, growtharrest.
Next, we used the resulting reaction map to design a
qualitative dynamical model with GINsim software [56,57],
which relies on a logical formalism [58–60]. To cope with the
relatively high number of components, we applied a semi-
automatic model reduction procedure to lower the computa-
tional cost of dynamical analyses, without losing the maindynamical properties of the system. We then performed logical
simulations to check the behaviour of the model in specific
documented situations, as well as to predict the behaviour in
novel situations. We further investigated the role of positive and
negative regulatory circuits in cell fate decision. Altogether, these
analyses provided novel insights into the mechanisms differen-
tiating the response of urinary bladder cancer cells to EGFRversus FGFR3 stimuli.Author Summary
Depending on environmental conditions, strongly inter-
twined cellular signalling pathways are activated, involving
activation/inactivation of proteins and genes in response
to external and/or internal stimuli. Alterations of somecomponents of these pathways can lead to wrong cellbehaviours. For instance, cancer-related deregulations lead
to high proliferation of malignant cells enabling sustained
tumour growth. Understanding the precise mechanismsunderlying these pathways is necessary to delineateefficient therapeutical approaches for each specific tumour
type. We particularly focused on the Mitogen-Activated
Protein Kinase (MAPK) signalling network, whose involve-ment in cancer is well established, although the precise
conditions leading to its positive or negative influence on
cell proliferation are still poorly understood. We tackledthis problem by first collecting sparse published biologicalinformation into a comprehensive map describing the
MAPK network in terms of stylised chemical reactions. This
information source was then used to build a dynamicalBoolean model recapitulating network responses tocharacteristic stimuli observed in selected bladder cancers.
Systematic model simulations further allowed us to link
specific network components and interactions with prolif-erative/anti-proliferative cell responses.Modelling of MAPK Influence on Cell Fate Decision

Methods
Logical modelling
We built our dynamical model using the logical formalism
originally proposed by Thomas [58,59]. Implemented in GINsim,our logical modelling approach initially requires the delineation ofa regulatory graph, where each vertex (node) represents a model
component and each arc (signed, directed edge) represents an
interaction (activation or inhibition) between two components.Here, all components are associated with Boolean variables,meaning that they can take two possible levels, 0 or 1, denoting theabsence/inactivation or the presence/activition of the modelledentities (protein activation level, gene expression level, activation ofa cellular process, etc.). The model definition is completed by
assigning a logical rule to each component. This logical rule
specifies the target value of the component depending on thepresence/absence of its regulators, using the classical Booleanoperators AND, OR and NOT.
Logical simulations
The dynamical behaviour of the model can be computed
starting from any initial state, step by step, updating the currentstate according to the logical formulae (logical simulations) [60].
Updating policy. Two updating policies are mainly used.
According to the synchronous policy, all components are updatedsimultaneously at each step; consequently, each state has at mostone successor. In contrast, according to the asynchronous policy,
only one variable can be updated at each step and all the possible
successors of a state are computed. Mixed policies based on thenotion of priority classes can also be defined using GINsim [61],where subsets of components are ranked. At each step, highestrank variables are then updated in a synchronous or asynchronousway.
In this work, we have used the fully asynchronous updating
policy, which usually generates more realistic behaviours [58].
State transition graphs and attractors. The dynamics of a
logical model can be represented in terms of a state transitiongraph (STG), in which nodes denote different states of the system(represented by a Boolean vector encompassing the values of allthe components), whereas arcs represent enabled transitionsbetween pairs of states. Of particular interest are the statesforming attractors, i.e. (groups of) states from which the system
cannot escape, which represent potential asymptotical behaviours.
Attractors can be ranged into two main classes:
– stable states, corresponding to fixed points (i.e. states without
successors);
– cyclic attractors, corresponding to terminal cycles or to more
complex terminal strongly connected components, comprising
several intertwined cycles.
Leaning on a representation of the logical rules in terms of
Multi-valued Decision Diagrams (MDD), an algorithm enables thecomputation of all the stable states of a logical model (indepen-dently of the initial conditions) [62]. The efficiency of thealgorithm (which does not require to compute the state transitiongraph) makes this tool particularly useful when dealing with largelogical models. However, other means are needed to assess the
reachability of the stable states from specific initial states, or yet to
identify cyclic attractors.
Deeper dynamical analyses imply the computation of the state
transition graph. GINsim user can define a set of initial states andan updating strategy; the software then computes the state
transition graph, highlighting stable states and cyclic attractors.GINsim further eases the definition of perturbations, which are
simulated by forcing the level of a subset of components to fixed
values (or value intervals). For instance, in the Boolean case, we
can reproduce a loss-of-function by setting a component to 0,
whatever the levels of its regulators, whereas a gain-of-function can
be simulated by forcing the corresponding component to 1. More
subtle perturbations can be simulated by rewriting relevant logical
rules.
As the size of the model considered increases, we are facing the
well known problem of the exponential growth of the state
transition graph. To cope with this problem, we used two methods
that amount to compress the model before simulation or to
compress the resulting state transition graph on the fly. These two
methods are briefly described hereafter, along with a complemen-
tary method enabling the identification of regulatory circuits
playing crucial dynamical roles.
Model reduction
To deal with large models, GINsim enables their reduction by
‘‘hiding’’ selected components [63]. In practice, the user selects the
components to hide, and the software hides each of them
iteratively, while recomputing the logical rules of their targets.
Provided that no functional regulatory circuit is eliminated in theprocess, this reduction preserves all attractors. For example, the
stable states are all conserved, in the sense that each stable state of
the reduced model is the projection (on the reduced state space) of
a stable state of the original model [63]. This tool is particularly
useful when the high dimensionality impedes the computation of
the full STG.
Hierarchical transition graph representation
The analysis of the paths from initial states to attractors can be
done directly on the STG when it is small (tens of states), but
becomes quickly intractable as the size of STG increases. To cope
with this difficulty, we use a novel feature of GINsim, which
iteratively clusters the state transition graph into groups of states
(components or hyper-nodes) sharing the same set of successors
[64]. The resulting hierarchical state transition graph (HTG)
displays all the reachable attractors (components at the bottom of
the graph), while the other clusters of states represent their basins
of attractions (including strict basins with a single outgoing arctargeting a specific attractor, or non-strict basins grouping states
that can reach a specific set of HTG components). HTG
computation is done on the fly, i.e. without having to store the
whole STG, which often leads to strong memory and CPU usage
shrinking. Furthermore, this functionality eases the identification
of the key commutations (changes of component levels) underlying
irreversible choices between the different reachable attractors.
Altogether, the HTG representation is very compact (often much
more compact than the more classical graph of strongly connected
components, as HTG further compacts linear/non circular
pathways) and very informative regarding the organisation of the
original STG.
Regulatory circuit analysis
Rene´ Thomas proposed generic rules linking the presence of
regulatory circuits (simple oriented regulatory cycles) in biological
networks with dynamical properties. The first rule states that the
existence of a positive circuit (involving an even number of
negative regulatory interactions) is a necessary condition for multi-
stationarity. The second rule states that the existence of a negativeregulatory circuit (involving an odd number of negative regulatory
interactions) is a necessary condition for the generation of
sustained oscillations [65]. More recently, Remy et al. [66]Modelling of MAPK Influence on Cell Fate Decision
PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 3 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003286
translated these rules into theorems in the case of asynchronous
Boolean dynamical systems (which is the case of our MAPK
model).
However, when embedded in a more complex network, specific
constraints on the values of the external components acting on
circuit components have to be fulfilled in order to allow aregulatory circuit to produce the expected behaviour (‘‘circuit
functionality constraints’’) [67]. The concept of circuit function-
ality has been formalised for logical models and implemented into
GINsim [62].
GINsim allows to compute all the functional positive and
negative circuits of a model. For each of them, the software also
provides the corresponding functionality context, defined as a setof constraints on the values of its external regulators. This tool
enables the identification of the regulatory circuits playing key
dynamical roles within a complex network.
Results
MAPK reaction map
Based on published data, we have built and annotated a
comprehensive reaction map using CellDesigner (supplementaryDataset S1). This map encompasses 232 species (proteins, genes,
complexes, other molecules) and 167 reactions involved in the
three most extensively documented MAPK cascades (ERK, JNK,
p38). The CellDesigner version of the map (XML format) is

further integrated into the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Networks
developed by the group of Emmanuel Barillot at Institut Curie inParis (https://acsn.curie.fr), where it can be explored using a web
browser.
Our reaction map takes into account signals propagating from
different major stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, stress,
which lead to the activation of MAPKs and their downstream
targets. It covers feedbacks and cross-talks among the MAPK
cascades, as well as the roles of the best documented phosphatases
and scaffold proteins. The main cellular compartments are also
represented (plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochon-dria, endosomes, etc.), showing the localisation of reactions within
the cell. When compartmentalisation has not been fully char-
acterised yet, reactions have been provisionally assigned to the
cytoplasm. Proteins are coloured to emphasise relevant families.
Figure 1 shows a map excerpt reporting two different mechanisms
of ERK activation (see map annotations for more details).
We considered two compartments named ‘‘Genes’’ and
‘‘Phenotypes’’ at the bottom of the map, which include
representative genes activated by the MAPK cascades, as well as
phenotypes (proliferation, apoptosis, growth arrest) enabled by
selected readouts.
We considered information concerning different human and
mouse cell types, implying that the MAPK map should be
considered as generic. Indeed, at this stage, information is lacking
to build a detailed map based exclusively on data for a specific cell
type. However, we selected biological events explicitly consideredto be cell type independent. When applicable, information
concerning cell types is provided through links to relevant
database entries (mainly PubMed).
Because the precision of the information retrieved from the
literature varies, our map represents different pathways with
different levels of details. For instance, we could find detailed
information about the scaffold proteins intervening in the ERK
cascade and on the sub-cellular localisation of the correspond-
ing protein complexes; in contrast, such information is stilllargely lacking for the JNK and p38 cascades. This is why themap currently reaches its greatest level of detail for the ERK
cascade.
Furthermore, the level of detail represented could also be
dictated by readability considerations. For instance, the RTK(receptor tyrosine kinase) component in the map represents severaldifferent receptors (e.g. EGFR, FGFR, VEGFR, etc.): all thesereceptors share common features that are related to MAPKactivation. However, their mechanisms of action may differ in
some subtle ways, which are not fundamental for our purpose
here. The detailed representation of all these pathways would havemade the map very difficult to read, and we thus decided tosimplify the graphical representation, while keeping track ofrelevant variations in the annotations of the corresponding speciesor reactions.
The resulting CellDesigner map constitutes a comprehensive
and integrated source of information concerning the roles of theMAPK network in cell fate decision, taking into account specificityfactors. This map can be directly used by biologists and modellersto get information about the reported phenomena. It can also beused for visualisation of high-throughput data (e.g. by automat-ically colouring components based on expression levels) derivedfrom different cell conditions, for example in order to identifydifferentially expressed components. This can also give insights
into cell type-dependent mechanisms.
MAPK logical model
Hereafter, we focus on the impact of the MAPK network in
urinary bladder cancer, with particular emphasis on the differen-tial behaviour between EGFR over-expression and FGFR3activating mutation.
Scope of the MAPK logical model. In order to study the
response of the MAPK network to specific stimuli, and itsinfluence on cell fate decision, we built a dynamical modelcovering the mechanisms reported in the MAPK map. We deriveda regulatory graph using the MAPK reaction map as aninformation source, as detailed in supplementary Text S1. Inparticular, we considered the following subset of stimuli in ourmodel: EGFR stimulus, FGFR3 stimulus, TGF bR stimulus, and
DNA damage. With reference to the latter stimulus, please notice
that we did not consider explicitly here the DNA repair process
following DNA damage, but we only account for the triggering ofgrowth arrest and apoptosis following sustained DNA damage[68]. In our dynamical model, DNA damage thus corresponds tosustained stress or to the effects of therapies involving DNA-damaging agents.
The regulatory graph shown in Figure 2 covers the activation of
MAPK targets that influence the choice between proliferation,growth arrest, and apoptosis. In particular, we consider MYC andp70 (in the absence of p21) as markers of cell cycle enablement,p21 as a marker of growth arrest, FOXO3 and p53 as markers ofapoptosis, whereas ERK and/or BCL2 indicate apoptosisdisablement. To ease the interpretation of phenotypes, we definedthree output nodes denoting proliferation, growth arrest, andapoptosis, respectively. These nodes represent enablement/
disablement of the corresponding processes, depending on the
MAPK network state, but not necessarily all requirements for thisphenotype. For instance, when proliferation is enabled (by theinterplay of MYC, p70 and p21), we assume that Cyclin/CDKcomplexes are activated. In this context, the node ‘‘Proliferation’’denotes entry into the cell cycle and does not account foralterations of later stages of the cell cycle. Similar considerationsare applicable for the other phenotypes modelled. This simplifi-cation is justified by our focus on the specific contributions of the
MAPK network to cell fate decision.Modelling of MAPK Influence on Cell Fate Decision

Each of the 52 components of the regulatory graph is modelled
by a Boolean variable along with a logical rule (Table S2)
specifying how the component activity depends on its regulators.
Reduced model versions. To cope with the relatively high
dimension (52 components) of our model, we took advantage of
the model reduction function implemented in GINsim (see
Methods). Indeed, it is difficult to perform simulations with the
original model version, as it entails 252states. The choice of
components to hide depends on the simulation performed. For
instance, if we plan to simulate a p53 loss-of-function and observe
its effects on p21, we better conserve p53 (otherwise we cannot
define the perturbed version) and p21 (otherwise, we cannot
explicitly observe its value). However, as we wanted to test several
situations, almost half of the MAPK model components were
needed to be observable. Consequently, we designed several
reduced versions of the original MAPK model, each of which
dedicated to a subset of simulations. This strategy enabled us to
drastically reduce the computational cost of our in silico
experiments (the dimension of the reduced models ranged from
16 to 18 components).
Altogether, we defined three different reduced model versions,
whose component lists are reported in supplementary Table S3.
These definitions are enclosed in the comprehensive model file
(supplementary Dataset S4) and enable the generation of reducedversions according to simulation needs. Figure 3 shows the
regulatory graph corresponding to one reduced version, namely,
‘‘red1’’. Supplementary Dataset S3 lists the simulations performedfor each reduced version. The three model reductions were found
equivalent in terms of attractors and main dynamical properties.Briefly, reduction ‘‘red1’’ was used to obtain the results discussedin the sections ‘‘Coherence with well established bladder cancerderegulations’’ and ‘‘Predictions generated with the MAPK logicalmodel’’, while reductions ‘‘red2’’ and ‘‘red3’’ were used to obtainthe results discussed in the section ‘‘Coherence with additionalcancer-related facts’’.
Coherence of the logical model behaviour with
published data
The logical rules assigned to model components were inferred
from information about a broad range of experiments and cellularconditions. To check the coherence of the global behaviour of theresulting model with current biological knowledge, we systemat-ically compared its dynamical properties with published data
concerning different tumoural cell types, with particular attention
to bladder cancer. More specifically, we first assessed thedynamical behaviour of the model under well establishedperturbations observed in the bladder cancer subtypes of interest.We further checked the coherence of the model behaviour with anadditional list of biological facts, not necessarily involved inbladder cancer. These analyses were carried out by performingasynchronous simulations for selected initial conditions (initialstates, input signals, potentially in the presence of perturbations),and observing the attractors reached by the system.
Figure 1. Molecular map for ERK regulation and sub-cellular localisation. After RAS activation, ERK cascade can be recruited and activated
on plasma membrane with the help of KRS1 scaffold protein (upper part of the figure); activated ERK is then released (in complex with MEK and KSR1)into the cytoplasm, where it can activate some of its cytoplasmic targets (e.g. PLA2G4A protein). Alternatively, activated receptor complex cantranslocate to late endosomes (left part of the figure), where ERK cascade can be triggered with the help of MP1 scaffold protein; in this case,activated ERK monomers are released into the cytoplasm, from where they can translocate into the nucleus and exert other effects (e.g. induction of
DUSP1 phosphatase). This map is a small fraction of the detailed MAPK network built with the software CellDesigner (www.celldesigner.org) and

Iron acquisition and oxidative stress response
in aspergillus fumigatus
Madison Brandon1,2*,B r a dH o w a r d3,4, Christopher Lawrence3,4and Reinhard Laubenbacher2,5,6
Abstract
Background: Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous airborne fungal pathogen that presents a life-threatening health
risk to individuals with weakened immune systems. A. fumigatus pathogenicity depends on its ability to acquire iron
from the host and to resist host-generated oxidative stress. Gaining a deeper understanding of the molecular
mechanisms governing A. fumigatus iron acquisition and oxidative stress response may ultimately help to improve the
diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillus infections.
Results: This study follows a systems biology approach to investigate how adaptive behaviors emerge from
molecular interactions underlying A. fumigatus iron regulation and oxidative stress response. We construct a Boolean
network model from known interactions and simulate how changes in environmental iron and superoxide levels
affect network dynamics. We propose rules for linking long term model behavior to qualitative estimates of cell
growth and cell death. These rules are used to predict phenotypes of gene deletion strains. The model is validated on
the basis of its ability to reproduce literature data not used in model generation.
Conclusions: The model reproduces gene expression patterns in experimental time course data when A. fumigatus is
switched from a low iron to a high iron environment. In addition, the model is able to accurately represent the
phenotypes of many knockout strains under varying iron and superoxide conditions. Model simulations support the
hypothesis that intracellular iron regulates A. fumigatus transcription factors, SreA and HapX, by a post-translational,
rather than transcriptional, mechanism. Finally, the model predicts that blocking siderophore-mediated iron uptake
reduces resistance to oxidative stress. This indicates that combined targeting of siderophore-mediated iron uptake
and the oxidative stress response network may act synergistically to increase fungal cell killing.

Background
Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous airborne fungus
which has become an increasingly dangerous pathogen
of humans worldwide, causing invasive infections, severe
asthma and sinusitis [1]. The most severe form of A. fumi-
gatus infection, called invasive aspergillosis (IA), occurs
when inhaled A. fumigatus spores germinate into hyphae
and invade lung tissue. IA is a major cause of mortality
in immunocompromised human hosts [2-6]. In immuno-
competent individuals A. fumigatus may trigger allergic

Full list of author information is available at the end of the articlereactions and is a major cause of fungal keratitis, an
inflammation of the cornea [7].
Our focus on A. fumigatus oxidative stress response
and iron acquisition is motivated by the following three
arguments. First, several studies show that deletion of
genes involved in either A. fumigatus oxidative stress
response or iron acquisition leads to attenuated virulence
in vivo [5,8-10]. Impairment of the corresponding host
defense mechanisms, e.g. defective ROS production or
inability to sufficiently deplete available iron, also leads
to an increased susceptibility to A. fumigatus infection
[4,10,11]. Second, recent publications present proof of
concept that targeting either A. fumigatus oxidative stress
response or iron acquisition systems may be an effective
treatment strategy [10,12]. Thus oxidative stress response

and iron acquisition are important systems contribut-
ing to A. fumigatus pathogenicity, and both systems are
feasible targets for therapeutic intervention. Third, iron
uptake and oxidative stress response networks are known
to interact, and hence more can be learned about the
molecular mechanisms underlying these networks if they
are studied together. In fact, a connection between iron
uptake and oxidative stress response has been described
in both A. fumigatus and S. cerevisiae [13-15]. These
motivating points will now be discussed in greater detail.
Several lines of evidence point to the A. fumigatus ROS-
detoxifying enzymes as key virulence factors and potential
drug targets. Firstly, on the host side, the activation of
the enzymatic complex NADPH oxidase (NOX) and sub-
sequent production of cytotoxic ROS by host phagocytic
cells is a critical mechanism for host defense against fun-
gal pathogens such as A. fumigatus [16-18]. Noteably,
a mouse model of fungal keratitis in the cornea using
mice that do not express a functional NOX complex
showed that neutrophil NOX expression was required
for inhibiting A. fumigatus growth [10]. From a fun-
gal perspective, genes encoding oxidative stress response
enzymes are known to be among the most differentially
expressed genes of A. fumigatus hyphae following expo-
sure to human neutrophils from healthy individuals [19].
Furthermore, A. fumigatus antioxidant enzymes and the
ROS-sensing transcription factor deletion strains show a
heightened sensitivity to ROS in vitro [9,10,20].
Other evidence suggests that the adeptness of A. fumi-
gatus to acquire iron from the host is a major basis of its
pathogenicity. Both the fungus and host require iron for
important cellular functions including respiration, gene
regulation, DNA synthesis, and oxidative stress response
[21]. Iron deprivation of invading pathogens by the host
is a crucial host defense mechanism [22-24]. To combat
this, fungi secrete siderophores, low-molecular-mass iron
binding compounds that sequester iron from host pro-
teins. [25]. A significant body of evidence suggests that
the victor of this battle for iron is a key determinant
of whether infection will persist or be cleared [25-28].
Notably, a mutant A. fumigatus strain unable to produce
both extra- and intracellular siderophores was avirulent
in a mouse model of IA [5]. Any advantage A. fumigatus
has in the battle for iron can be dangerous. For instance,
increased iron in bone marrow is a risk factor for IA in
high-risk patients [11]. Similarly, the heightened suscep-
tibility to fungal infections in neutropenic patients may
be in part due to increased extracellular iron due to the
absence of host cells which mediate iron sequestration
[29].
Leal et al . show that the use of topical drugs to tar-
get either A. fumigatus oxidative stress response or iron
acquisition systems is effective for treating A. fumiga-
tusinfection in mice cornea [10,12]. The fungal ironacquisition system is a particularly promising target
for therapeutic intervention because the fungal proteins
which import ferri-siderophores are one of the few protein
families that are unique to fungi [30]. This might make it
possible to design drugs which specifically target the fun-
gus without affecting the host, perhaps by a “Trojan horse”
approach [31,32]. Furthermore, the iron acquisition and
oxidative stress response networks are connected. Indeed
it was found in A. fumigatus that deletion of a key iron
regulatory protein, /Delta1sreA, caused increased sensitivity
to superoxide [13]. Also in A. fumigatus deletion of an
intracellular siderophore led to decreased expression of
conidial, but not hyphal, catalase [33]. Similarly, in A.
nidulans oxidative stress was shown to increase the accu-
mulation of an intracellular siderophore [14]. Finally, a
yeast mutant with deletion of genes that regulate the tran-
scription of high-affinity iron transport genes also showed
several phenotypes related to oxidative stress such as
hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide [15].
The role of mathematical modeling
The purpose of the present work is to gain a deeper
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underly-
ing the systems that most contribute to A. fumigatus
pathogenicity, the iron acquisition and oxidative stress
response networks. For this purpose, we have constructed
a novel dynamic mathematical model of key molecu-
lar interactions defining these networks. Mathematical
modeling of complex molecular interaction networks
allows for the encoding of dynamic interactions among
molecules, and thus enables the simulation of global net-
work behavior based on information known about indi-
vidual interactions.
Recently, the first computational model of A. fumiga-
tusiron regulation was proposed [34]. Taking a top-down
approach, Linde et al. used gene expression time series
data to reverse engineer a regulatory network and pre-
dict new interactions between transcription factors and
target genes. The authors constructed a system of differ-
ential equations to model changes in gene expression as a
function of other genes in the network. A major challenge
to building differential equations models is that many of
the required parameters are either unknown or unmea-
surable, and so parameters must be estimated by fitting
equations to experimental time series data, which is lim-
ited for A. fumigatus iron regulation and oxidative stress
response.
However, there is a wealth of qualitative data for these
networks, for example the interaction between a tran-
scription factor and a gene, from high-throughput tran-
scriptomic experiments such as microarrays [13,29,35]. In
contrast to the Linde et al. computational study, we take
a bottom-up approach to investigate both iron regula-
tion and oxidative stress response, and we apply a discrete

dynamic modeling framework. Discrete models make use
of the available qualitative data by encapsulating the reg-
ulatory logic driving a network, and they do not require
kinetic parameters. Simulation of discrete models pro-
vides coarse-grained information as the network evolves
over an arbitrary unit of time in response to broad changes
in some physiological condition. Qualitative observations
generated by these models are extremely useful for inves-
tigating the ability of known or proposed information to
explain current experimental results, studying how per-
turbations may alter global behavior, and for pinpointing
productive future experiments.
Discrete models, in particular Boolean network mod-
els, are routinely used to investigate biological systems
such as gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways,
and metabolic pathways [36-41]. Discrete models have
contributed insights into host-pathogen interactions for
several pathogenic bacteria [42-44]. To our knowledge,
discrete models have not yet been used to study A. fumi-
gatus biology, yet many aspects of yeast biology have
been explored via discrete models [45-47]. This includes
a Boolean network model of metabolic adaptation to
oxygen in relation to iron homeostasis and oxidative
stress [48].
Results and discussion
Description of model species
The model contains an oxidative stress response mod-
ule and a larger iron acquisition module which is made
up of five submodules: siderophore biosynthesis (SB),
iron uptake, iron storage, iron usage, and iron regulation.
Figure 1 is a graphical representation of all model species
(nodes), their interactions (edges), and the sign of the
interaction.
Siderophore biosynthesis
A. fumigatus produces four siderophores, low molecular
mass ferric iron-specific chelators [33]. Two extracellu-
lar siderophores are excreted from the cell to sequester
iron from the extracellular space [8]. And two intracel-
lular siderophores are used for intracellular iron storage
[14,49]. For simplicity, our model considers only one
extracellular siderophore, triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC),
and one intracellular siderophore, ferricrocin (FC), which
have been shown to be the two most abundant and
active A. fumigatus siderophores [50]. The first step in
the biosynthesis of all four siderophores is the hydrox-
ylation of ornithine catalyzed by SidA, an ornithine
monooxygenase.
Iron uptake
Iron uptake is believed to be the main iron homeostasis
control mechanism used by A. fumigatus ,i np a r tb e c a u s e
mechanisms of iron excretion have not been found infungi [51]. A. fumigatus has three known mechanisms of
iron uptake: low affinity ferrous iron uptake, which has not
yet been characterized at the molecular level, and two high
affinity ferric iron uptake systems, namely siderophore-
mediated iron uptake and reductive iron assimilation
(RIA) [8]. RIA involves the reduction of ferric iron to fer-
rous iron by the ferric reductase FreB and subsequently
the import of ferrous iron by a protein complex consisting
of the ferroxidase FetC and the iron permease FtrA [52].
For simplicity, these three proteins are modeled as a single
species called RIA.
Siderophore-mediated iron uptake is represented in
the model by nodes TAFC, MirB, and EstB. TAFC is
released into the extracellular space to steal ferric iron
from host proteins such as transferrin [53]. A protein fam-
ily called siderophore-iron transporters (SIT) recognizes
and retrieves specific ferri-siderophores. After binding to
Fe3+, the ferri-TAFC complex is taken back up by the
TAFC-specific SIT MirB [54]. After import into the cell
the ferri-TAFC complex is degraded by a TAFC-specific
esterase called EstB [55]. Subsequently, breakdown prod-
ucts are recycled, and iron is released into the cell for
transfer to intracellular siderophores or the iron vacuole
[56].
Iron storage
Unlike bacteria, plants and animals, most fungi lack
ferritin-mediated iron storage [51]. Instead, A. fumigatus
relies on siderophore-mediated iron storage via the intra-
cellular siderophore FC and a siderophore-independent
iron storage unit, the iron vacuole [49,56]. Import of iron
into the vacuole is in part mediated by the protein CccA
which is localized in the vacuolar membrane [56]. The
labile iron pool, a pool of redox-active iron, is also mod-
eled as a transitory state between the release of iron from
ferri-TAFC and the transfer of iron to FC or the vacuole.
Again, since fungi lack mechanisms for iron excretion,
iron storage plays a crucial role in avoiding iron-induced
toxicity. In A. nidulans , FC deficiency was shown to cause
an increase in LIP and a decrease in the oxidative stress
resistance of hyphae [57].
Iron usage

thesis, TCA cycle, respiration, and ribosome biogenesis,

Regulation
Iron is toxic in excess; thus tight regulatory mechanisms
are required to maintain iron homeostasis. Iron regulation
inA. fumigatus is controlled by two central transcrip-
tion factors: the bZip CCAAT-binding transcription fac-
tor HapX and the GATA transcription factor SreA [13,29].
HapX and SreA are postulated to sense intracellular iron

levels through a posttranslational mechanism similar to
the mechanism employed by a closely related species,
the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [27]. In S.
pombe , orthologs of HapX and SreA physically interact
with a monothiol glutaredoxin Grx4 which is localized
along the nuclear rim [58-60]. When intracellular iron lev-
els are low Grx4 maintains SreA in an inactive state [59].
When intracellular iron levels are high, Grx4 inactivates
HapX by directing its export from the nucleus [58]. Hence,
intracellular iron blocks HapX function while activating
SreA function at the posttranslational level. Furthermore,
SreA represses transcription of hapX when intracellular
iron levels are high, while HapX represses transcription
ofsreA when intracellular iron levels are low. Both tran-
scriptional and posttranslational regulatory mechanisms
are modeled.
SreA transcriptionally represses genes coding for pro-
teins involved in iron uptake, including sidA,mirB ,
estB, and those involved in RIA [13]. HapX activates
siderophore biosynthesis, in part by upregulating the pro-
duction of the precursor ornithine, and activates the
transcription of mirB [29]. HapX indirectly activates the
transcription of sidA,estB, and the genes involved inRIA through its repression of sreA. Additionally, HapX
represses iron consuming pathways, cat1,a n d cccA at the
transcriptional level.
Oxidative stress response
NOX expressed by host phagocytic cells catalyzes the con-
version of oxygen to the the extremely reactive superox-
ide anion, O−
2. Contact between neutrophils and hyphae
triggers a respiratory burst, the targeted release of O−
2
from the neutrophil into the extracellular space where it
diffuses into nearby hyphal cells. The A. fumigatus ROS-
sensing transcription factor Yap1 is believed to be the
main regulator of antioxidant defense against O−
2and
hydrogen peroxide, H 202[61,62]. Yap1 typically resides in
the cytoplasm, yet under oxidative stress conditions Yap1
localizes to the nucleus and from there controls, directly
or indirectly, the expression of key ROS-detoxifying
enzymes including superoxide dismutases (SODs), cata-
lases, and thioredoxin peroxidases (peroxiredoxins) [61].
Elevated free iron levels (high LIP) in the cell also con-
tribute to the formation of ROS [63].

H2O by either catalases or peroxiredoxins. A. fumigatus
produces four SODs, yet only the mitochondrial SOD2
and cytoplasmic SOD3 are modeled here since both are
most strongly expressed in hyphae, the tissue invasive
form of this pathogen, as opposed to in conidia [20]. A.
fumigatus hyphae produce two catalases, Cat1 and Cat2,
which break down hydrogen peroxide [9]. The thiore-
doxin pathway in A. fumigatus is not well characterized;
however, two putative peroxiredoxins and five putative
thioredoxins have been identified [10,61]. Briefly, per-
oxiredoxins reduce H 202and by doing so become oxi-
dized, a non-functional state. Thioredoxins then reduce
the oxidized peroxiredoxins back to their functional state
so that more H 202can be reduced [64]. In the model
the thioredoxin pathway is modeled as a single vari-
able. Note that in Figure 1 the ROS species has a self-
activating arrow. The purpose of this interaction is to
enforce “memory” in the system, i.e. if ROS is high
at the current time step and antioxidant enzymes are
not expressed or inactive, then the ROS variable should
“remember” to remain high until antioxidant enzymes are
active.
Building and simulating the mathematical model
The model presented in this paper is discrete. This means
species can take on only a finite number of states, and
the state of each species is iteratively updated at discrete
time steps according to logical rules. The discrete model
presented here is a Boolean network model, meaning
that each species can take on only two states (e.g. low
expressed or high expressed; low active or high active),
which may be represented numerically by either a 0 or
a 1. Furthermore, the rules determining how species are
updated are Boolean functions.
We conducted an extensive literature survey to iden-
tify key species involved in the A. fumigatus iron reg-
ulatory and oxidative stress response networks as well
as the interactions of each species with other species
i nt h en e t w o r k s( F i g u r e1 ) .T a b l e1g i v e sab i o l o g i c a l
description of each species and the meaning assigned to
its states. Note that for different species we may assign
different meanings to their states. Importantly, the two
species iron and superoxide should be thought of as
external parameters since they are meant to distinguish
between different physiological conditions that are reflec-
tive of the host-pathogen interaction. Iron and superox-
ide have no regulators (incoming arrows) (see Figure 1)
and so, unlike other species, a fixed state is chosen at
the start of a simulation and this state will never be
updated.
Next we integrated all identified interactions into a
dynamic framework by specifying, through logical rules
called update rules, how each species transitions between
its two states based upon the states of its inputs. Table 2Table 1 List of species, their biological type, and their

Species that appear on the right side of the =represent states at time t.
In general, the dynamic behavior of discrete models
is simulated by starting from an initial state and then
enumerating the changing state space as each species is
updated over a specified number of iterations called time
steps. The result of deterministic simulations, when all
species are updated simultaneously at each time step, is
shown in Figure 2. This system has no steady state solu-
tion for any of the four external conditions. All long term
behavior is oscillatory, i.e. the stable states form a limit
cycle and 100% of the 1048576 states converge to the limit
cycle displayed.
Many biological processes such as gene expression have
been found to exhibit a high degree of stochasticity[66-69]. Furthermore, protein levels can differ signif-
icantly among cells in a population [70,71]. To our
knowledge no single cell gene expression or protein level
measurements are available for A. fumigatus .H e n c ei n
order to make comparisons to experimental data possible,
we needed to account for the variability that one observes
in a population of cells. We accounted for this variabil-
ity by simulating randomness in the update of species.
At each time step, rather than updating all species, some
species are randomly selected to be updated, while the
unselected species are left in their current state. We
assume that the average of many of these stochastic simu-
lations represents a population level measurement.

Linking model simulation results to phenotype predictions
For the results presented in this paper, we ran 100 inde-
pendent stochastic simulations (initialized in the same
state) and, for each species, calculated the average state
at each time step. From there, we counted the number
of times a species took on any average state throughout
the simulation period. We can plot a histogram of these
counts to visualize a distribution of species’ average state
across 100 simulations, as in Figure 3. To characterize
long-term behavior, we introduce a measure called the sta-
ble distribution mean (SDM) for a given species under
a given set of initial conditions. The SDM is simply the
mean of the distribution of the average states from time
steps 100 to 200. Excluding the first 100 time steps from
the calculation gives the model time to settle into a stable
configuration.
We first simulated the Boolean network model of wild
type A. fumigatus under each of the four possible condi-
tions: (1) low iron and low superoxide, (2) high iron and
low superoxide, (3) low iron and high superoxide, and (4)
high iron and high superoxide. Figure 3 (A) - (C) show the
distributions of average states across 100 wild type sim-
ulations for six selected species under three of the fourconditions. Wild type distributions are not shown for the
remaining condition; instead Figure 4(B) and (D) show
trajectories, the average state at each time step, for eight
selected species.
For both low iron conditions, we observed that HapX,
the transcription factor activating iron uptake and
repressing iron consumption, is more active than SreA,
the transcription factor repressing iron acquisition. This
leads to strong activity of proteins related to siderophore-
mediated iron uptake (MirB) and reductive iron assim-
ilation (RIA). Conversely, for the high iron conditions
we observe that SreA is more active than HapX. Conse-
quently, activity of both MirB and RIA are significantly
reduced as compared to the low iron, low superoxide
condition. These results recapitulate experimental obser-
vations [29,72].
ROS-detoxifying enzymes, SOD2/3 and Cat1/2, are
moderately active in the low iron, low superoxide con-
dition. As expected, since free iron and superoxide con-
tribute to ROS, the activity of SOD2/3 and Cat1/2 are
elevated in high iron and high superoxide conditions. Fur-
ther, we observed that in low iron conditions Cat1/2 is less
active than SOD2/3. This makes sense because catalases

a high growth phenotype. If the ROS SDM falls in [0.66,1] we interpret this as high cell death. When the SDM of ROS is 1, we assume the ROS is so

require heme as a cofactor whereas SODs instead require
copper, zinc or manganese [20].
Based on experimental results of wild type A. fumiga-
tusgrowth under each of the four conditions [8,20,33],
we used the stable distribution mean (SDM) of model
variables ROS and ICP to establish a phenotype refer-
ence according to the following rules (see Figure 3). If the
SDM of ICP is 0, then we interpret the model observa-
tion as minimal or no growth. An ICP SDM in (0, 0.33) is
interpreted as low growth. Otherwise, an ICP in [0.33, 1]
signifies a high growth phenotype. If the ROS SDM falls
in [0.66,1] we interpret this as high cell death. When the
SDM of ROS is 1, we assume ROS is so overwhelming that
the entire population dies. Otherwise, for an ROS SDM in
[0, 0.66) the interpretation is low cell death. These rules
bin wild type model behavior to match what we observe
experimentally. We then used this set of rules to infer the
severity of model knockouts.
Stochastic simulations reproduce in vitro time course data
We validated the model on the basis of its ability to repro-
duce transcriptional time course data from a previously
published study and data generated in this study. In bothexperiments, A. fumigatus i sg r o w ni ni r o nd e p l e t e dm i n -
imal media (low iron, low superoxide conditions). After
an incubation period, iron is added to the media (high
iron, low superoxide conditions) and gene expression is
measured over a period of hours either using microarrays
(Schrettl et al., 2008 [13]) or by qRT-PCR (this study, see
Methods).
To mimic the switch from low iron to high iron con-
ditions, all simulations were initialized from a state of
iron starvation (Figure 4G). Iron and superoxide were
fixed at 1 and 0, respectively, throughout model simula-
tions. Experimental results are displayed alongside model
simulation results in Figure 4. From the Schrettl et al.
study, we plot all time course data for genes which corre-
spond to species in the model. For knockout simulations,
the state of the corresponding species is fixed at 0. To
distinguish between model and experimental knockouts,
using sreA as an example, we write sreA=0 to refer to
model knockouts and /Delta1sreA to refer to experimental
knockouts.
The model provides a good qualitative reproduction of
changes in gene expression over time. Additionally the
model captures the relative differences in degrees of up-

or down-regulation among genes. For ease of exposition,
we discuss the following results in the syntax of model
species even though some model species refer to amount
of protein while the experimental results refer to amount
of transcript.
Wild type results
For wild type A. fumigatus , the experimental and model
simulation results show the same expression patterns.
Following the switch from low to high iron, catalases
Cat1/2, the vacuolar iron importer CccA, and sreA were
quickly up-regulated, then slowly decreased and leveled
off. After the addition of iron, the expression of hapX ,
siderophore biosynthesis enzyme SidA, ferri-siderophore
importer MirB, ferri-siderophore esterase EstB, and
reductive iron assimilation RIA ( ftrA in the experimen-
tal data) were quickly down-regulated and remained
low. Moreover, the model recapitulates experimental
observations that among species contributing to iron
uptake, SidA and MirB were less active under high iron
conditions, as compared to the activity of RIA and EstB.
/Delta1sreA results
Experimental and model simulation results are also in
agreement for the /Delta1sreA deletion strain, except for SidA
and MirB which we discuss shortly. As in the wild type
case, expression of CccA and Cat1/2 increased sharply
after the addition of iron. However in the /Delta1sreA knock-
out, expression of CccA and Cat1/2 remained high over
time. This can be attributed to the fact that iron uptake
mechanisms were depressed in a /Delta1sreA mutant. Indeed,
in contrast to the wild type case, both experimental and
model simulation results showed no change in the expres-
sion of hapX , EstB, or RIA despite being exposed to high
iron over a long period of time.
In the /Delta1sreA deletion experimental data the amount of
sidA transcript remained the same, whereas the amount
of SidA enzymatic activity in the model simulation plum-
meted to very low. This in fact is not a discrepancy
and serves to illustrate an important point. Although
both HapX and SreA ultimately activate and respectively
repress SidA enzymatic activity, only SreA directly tran-
scriptionally regulates sidA [13,29]. Instead, HapX up-
regulates the production of ornithine, the SidA substrate.
This explains the derepression of sidA in the experimental
data yet the lack of SidA activity in the model simula-
tion. A difference between amount of sidA transcript and
SidA enzymatic activity is not visible in the wild type
data because HapX indirectly regulates the transcription
ofsidA through repression of sreA; this feature is lost in a
/Delta1sreA mutant.
The discrepancy between gene expression of mirB
in the experiment and activity of MirB in the model
is unexpected since MirB is known to be regulatedtranscriptionally by both HapX and SreA [13,29]. This
may suggest that MirB is in fact not regulated transcrip-
tionally by HapX. Or alternatively, since MirB is known
to transport other siderophores it may have additional
regulators [54].
Regulation of HapX and SreA by iron
The post-translational regulation of S. pombe orthologs of
HapX and SreA by iron has been investigated [58-60]. A.
fumigatus HapX and SreA are postulated to sense intra-
cellular iron levels through a similar post-translational
mechanism, but the corresponding mechanism has not
yet been identified [27]. We included in the model both
the known transcriptional regulation of hapX and sreA,
by SreA and HapX respectively, and the proposed but
not yet verified post-translational regulation of HapX and
SreA by intracellular iron. Additionally, we analyzed a
modified model whereby hapX and sreA were regulated
transcriptionally by iron, and all other interactions are
the same. Both versions of the model were consistent
with gene expression data for the wild type. However,
the model with HapX and SreA regulated by iron at
the post-transtlational level, but not the modified model,
agreed with the Schrettl et al. hapX gene expression data
for the /Delta1sreA mutant strain (see Figure 4H). This pro-
vides support for the hypothesis that, as in S. pombe ,
a post-translational regulation of the iron regulatory
proteins HapX and SreA by iron is in fact employed by
A. fumigatus .
Model knockout simulations recapitulate experimental
gene deletion results.
Next, we systematically analyzed the effect of all single and
double knockouts on model predicted phenotypes under
each of the four external conditions. Key observations
from wild type and knockout simulations are summarized
in Table 3.
Iron regulation knockouts
For the low iron conditions, the SidA =0 knockout led
to minimal or no growth (SDM of ICP =0). However, no
growth defects were observed when RIA =0u n d e rt h e
same conditions. In high iron conditions, the SidA =0
knockout did not deviate from the wild type high growth
phenotype. However, in high iron conditions, a double
RIA =SidA =0 knockout led to minimal or no growth.
These results are consistent with experimental results
showing: (1) a /Delta1sidA but not /Delta1ftrA mutant is avirulent in
a mouse model of aspergillosis [5,8], and (2) that RIA can
compensate for a lack of siderophores in high iron but not
low iron conditions [33].

out any part of the siderophore iron uptake system under
low iron conditions (TAFC =0, MirB =0, or EstB =0)
resulted in a minimal growth phenotype. Interestingly,
we observed an accumulation of siderophores for either
MirB =0o rE s t B =0 under low iron conditions, a behav-
ior which has been observed experimentally in an /Delta1estB
mutant [55].
The hapX =0 knockout displayed a minimal growth
phenotype under low iron conditions, but had no defects
under high iron conditions. Conversely, the sreA =0
knockout led to iron overload (SDM of LIP =1) and cell
death by overwhelming ROS (SDM of ROS =1) under
high iron conditions, but had no defects under low iron
conditions. This recapitulates experimental results show-
ing that growth defects of a /Delta1hapX mutant are confinedto low iron conditions while growth defects of a /Delta1sreA
mutant are confined to high iron conditions [13,29].
Oxidative stress response knockouts
As expected, wild type ROS-detoxifying enzyme activity
was lowest under the low iron, low superoxide condition.
The SDM of Cat1/2 was less than that of SOD2/3 and
the thioredoxin pathway (abbreviated to ThP in Table 3)
whenever iron was low. Under low superoxide conditions
the model predicted a Yap1 =0 or SOD2/3 =0 knockout,
but not a Cat1/2 =0o rT h p =0k n o c k o u t ,t ob ef a t a l .
This observation demonstrates that the model accounts
for the redundancy that both catalases and peroxiredoxins
reduce H 2O2. Under high superoxide conditions, model
knockouts of any of the four oxidative stress-related
Brandon et al. BMC Systems Biology  (2015) 9:19 Page 12 of 17
species had a high cell death phenotype due to over-
whelming ROS.
The observation that Yap1 or SOD2/3 deletion is
more severe than deletion of Cat1/2 or blocking of the
thioredoxin pathway is consistent with experimental
results from Leal et al. which show that /Delta1yap1 and
/Delta1sod1/2/3 mutant strains are sensitive to neutrophil-
mediated oxidative stress, whereas a /Delta1cat1/2 strain is
not [10]. Yet the observation is inconsistent with a result
from the same study which showed that blocking the
thioredoxin pathway results in a reduction of in vivo
hyphal growth similar to deletion of either yap1 orsod2/3
[10]. An earlier study, which demonstrated that a /Delta1cat1/2
mutant showed increased sensitivity to H 2O2in vitro
and delayed growth during infection in a rat model of
aspergillosis, further conflicts with the Leal et al. study
and provides support for the model predicted phenotype
of a Cat1/2 =0 knockout [9]. Overall, the severity of
experimental knockout results seem to be exaggerated
by some model predictions. In particular, deletion of
either yap1 orsod2/3 should not result in high cell
death in the absence of oxidative stress, yet under low
superoxide conditions the model predicted knockouts a
high cell death phenotype for Yap1 =0a n dS O D 2 / 3 =0
knockouts.
Discrepancies between experimental results and model
predictions indicate that important species or interactions
may be missing from the model. This may reflect that our
understanding of A. fumigatus oxidative stress response
is still not complete. For instance, there may be uniden-
tified redundancy, some of which could be attributed
to LaeA-controlled secondary metabolites which inhibitneutrophil production of NOX [73]. Yet knockout exper-
iments of several of these metabolites as well as laeA
suggest they may play no role in protecting A. fumiga-
tusfrom neutrophil-mediated oxidative stress [10]. Since
model-predicted phenotypes of Yap1 and Yap1-regulated
species knockouts are most overstated in low superox-
ide conditions, it is possible that the model lacks some
constitutively active or baseline antioxidants which may
be useful for neutralizing ROS produced during normal
cellular activities but may not necessarily be helpful in
combating oxidative stress. As more research is done to
characterize new players in the A. fumigatus oxidative
stress response network, the oxidative stress response
module of this model can be improved and new insights
may be gained.
Model suggests combined blocking of iron uptake and
oxidative stress response
Of the four conditions in Table 3, the low iron and high
superoxide condition most resembles the environment
that A. fumigatus cells experience inside a mammalian
host. Under this condition, model knockouts which
impaire siderophore-mediated iron uptake increased A.
fumigatus sensitivity to oxidative stress. A similar rela-
tionship between high-affinity iron uptake and sensitivity
to oxidative stress has been observed in yeast [15]. This
observation led us to wonder what the model would pre-
dict for ROS levels if combined blocking of siderophore-
mediated iron uptake and oxidative stress response were
simulated under less rigid external conditions.
Several experimental studies have investigated target-
ing either siderophore-mediated iron uptake or oxidative

stress response, but none have investigated any potential
therapeutic gain by combined targeting. TAFC and MirB
are promising drug targets since they are easily acces-
sible and unique to fungi [30]. Leal et al. demonstrate
proof of concept that using lipocalin-1 to sequester TAFC
improves the treatment of topical A. fumigatus infection
[12]. An anti-cancer drug, PX-12, which is known to block
the thioredoxin pathway also shows promise as an anti- A.
fumigatus drug [10].
To investigate the effects of simultaneously inhibiting
siderophore-mediated iron uptake and oxidative stress
response, we simulated treatment with two hypothetical
drugs loosely based on lipocalin-1 and PX-12. Hypotheti-
cal drug 1 binds and inactivates TAFC from 50% of fungal
cells. Hypothetical drug 2 blocks the thioredoxin pathway
in 50% of fungal cells. For these simulations, we held
iron fixed at 0 but allowed superoxide to randomly toggle
between 0 and 1. This setup recapitulates host defense
mechanisms of sustained iron witholding and intermittent
respiratory bursts. Figure 5(A) shows two representative
superoxide trajectories when random toggling is allowed.
Figure 5(B) shows ROS stable distributions from the aver-
age of 100 stochastic simulations for treatment with Drug

treatments with 50% efficacy, we fixed either TAFC, ThP ,
or both at 0 for 50 of the 100 simulations. Drug 1 alone
has no effect, Drug 2 alone increases the ROS SDM from
0.64 to 0.74, and the combination of Drug 1 and Drug 2

Conclusions
In this study we introduce a stochastic Boolean model
of the iron regulatory and oxidative stress response net-
works in A. fumigatus . Model simulations of a population
ofA. fumigatus cells reproduces gene expression patterns
in experimental time course data when A. fumigatus is
switched from a low iron to a high iron environment. In
addition, the model is able to accurately represent the phe-
notypes of many knockout strains under varying iron and
superoxide conditions.
We drew three main observations from model analysis.
First, the model provides support for the hypothesis that
A. fumigatus iron regulatory proteins, HapX and SreA, are
regulated by iron at the post-translational level. Second,
based on discrepancies between model knockout sim-
ulations and experimental observations of A. fumigatus
oxidative stress response related mutants, it is likely that
important enzymes or pathways involved in A. fumigatus
ROS-detoxification remain uncharacterized. And third,
impairment of siderophore-mediated iron uptake mecha-
nisms reduces A. fumigatus resistance to oxidative stress.This fact could be exploited when designing a treatment
strategy.
Deterministic simulation (as well as individual stochas-
tic simulations, data not shown) of the model predicts
sustained oscillations under each of the four external con-
ditions (Figure 2). On the other hand when a population
of cells is modeled by averaging many stochastic simula-
tions, the model converges to a steady state distribution
(Figure 3). Without single cell data, it is unclear how to
interpret discrepancies between an individual (determin-
istic or stochastic) simulation and the average of many
stochastic simulations. It is conceivable that, in agree-
ment with individual model simulations, expression of
iron homeostasis and oxidative stress response genes in a
single A. fumgatus cell may continually oscillate, perhaps
always overshooting and undershooting ideal intracellu-
lar iron levels. A recent study in E coli reported damped
oscillations in the expression of genes involved in iron
homeostasis in a single E. coli cell undergoing a switch
from high iron to low iron conditions [21]. Future single
cell experiments of A. fumigatus could shed light on how
stochasticity arises in fungal iron regulatory and oxidative
stress response networks.
The intended future application of this model is to
incorporate it into a multi-scale systems biology model of
invasive aspergillosis in the lung. The ultimate goal of the
proposed multi-scale model is to capture the effect of the
initial inoculum on disease outcome and to allow for the
investigation of a variety of therapeutic interventions.

Discrete modeling framework
In order to translate the network interactions depicted in
t h ed i a g r a mo fF i g u r e1i n t oad y n a m i cd i s c r e t em o d e l ,
namely a time- and state-discrete dynamical system, the
state transitions for each species must be specified by
assigning an update rule that describes how the species’s
state will be updated at the next time step based upon the
states of its inputs at the current time step. Since this is a
Boolean model, each species can take on only two states
and update rules are Boolean functions. It is convenient
to encode update rules in an object called a transition
table. As an example, consider the iron-sensing transcrip-
tion factor SreA. From the literature we know that when
intracellular iron levels are low, SreA is kept in an inac-
tive state [59,60]. Based on this we decide the update of
SreA should depend on two inputs, its gene sreA and the
labile iron pool LIP . These interactions are represented in
Figure 1 as the two edges incident on SreA. Based on the
state descriptions assigned to SreA, sreA,a n dL I Pl i s t e di n
Table 1, we obtain the following table which determines
which state SreA will transition to at time step t+1b a s e d
on the states of sreA and LIP at the current time step, t.
Brandon et al. BMC Systems Biology  (2015) 9:19 Page 14 of 17
Using Table 1 to translate the state descriptions into 0’s
and 1’s, we obtain the following transition table.
This table encodes the AND function. Both sreA AND

ematical object rather than transition tables or Boolean
functions. Any discrete dynamical system can be rep-
resented as a system of polynomial equations over a
finite field. A model in this form is called a polynomial
dynamical system (PDS) and can be analyzed using theory
and tools from computational algebra [74,75]. Since each
species in a Boolean network model can take on only two
states, the finite field for our model is F2∼=Z/2Z, i.e., the
set of integers {0, 1 }where addition and multiplication is
modulo 2.
The polynomial dynamical system for our model (cor-
responding to the update rules listed in Table 2) is: F=

Incorporating stochasticity
In this study, we use a random update schedule to simulate
dynamic behavior. The basic idea behind this approach is
to change the deterministic update of each species into
a probability of being updated. The stochastic discrete
dynamical systems (SDDS) framework was used to gen-
erate stochastic simulations [76]. An SDDS is a time- and
state-discrete dynamical system which models stochas-
ticity at the functional level by introducing two update
probabilities that, together with the update function, spec-
ify a probability of transition of a given species at each
time step. Let pin↑be the probability that species xiwill
be updated given that the corresponding update func-
tion fispecifies an increase in state at the next time step.
Letp↓
ibe the probability xiwill be updated given that fi
specifies a decrease in state at the next time step. Then
a stochastic discrete dynamical system in nvariables is a
collection of triplets/braceleftBig

field. Thus a SDDS can be represented as a PDS along with
propensity parameters.
The probabilities p↑
i,p↓
i∈[ 0, 1] for all i∈{1,...,n}are
called the activation propensity and degradation propen-
sity, respectively, of the i-th species. If p↑
i=p↓
i=1 for all
i=1,...,nthen all species are updated simultaneously
at every time step, and the simulation is deterministic. To
implement a random update schedule, we let p↑
i=p↓
i=
0.5 for all i=1, ..,n, meaning that at each time step each
species has an equal probability of either being updated
or remaining in its current state. Hence at each time
step, some species are randomly selected to be updated
whereas others are not. Updating of selected species is
done simultaneously at each time step. A “time step” in
this model refers to a single round of updates in which the
Brandon et al. BMC Systems Biology  (2015) 9:19 Page 15 of 17
state of any given species can be updated only once. The
unit of time step is arbitrary, yet based on comparisons
with experimental time course data (Figure 4), we deter-
mined each time step of our model corresponds to about
6 minutes of real time.
Analysis of Dynamic Algebraic Models (ADAM), a free
web-based software tool which analyzes the dynamics of
discrete models using Gröbner bases calculations, was
used to generate the above PDS from transition tables and
to simulate dynamic behavior using the SDDS framework
[77]. ADAM is available at http://adam.plantsimlab.org/.
Experimental methods
A. fumigatus strain and growth conditions
The A. fumigatus strain used was wild-type AF293. A.
fumigatus was cultured on glucose minimal media plus
agar plates at 37°C for 7 to 10 days until fully conidiated.
Spores were harvested by flooding the culture plates with
endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline solution con-
taining 0.05% Tween-20 and swabbing with a sterile inoc-
ulation loop to obtain spore suspension. The spores were
vortexed and concentrations of spores were determined
by counting with a hemacytometer.
Incubation and harvesting
A. fumigatus was grown in a liquid shaker under iron
depleted conditions. 25 ×106A. fumigatus condia were
added to standard glucose minimal media plus 0.05%
Tween-20 but without iron in the trace elements to a final
volume of a 25 mL for a final concentration of 1 million
spores per mL. Flasks were incubated at 37°C and 200
rpm for 72 hours. Glass flasks were rinsed prior to inoc-
ulation with a 0.1 M HCL solution followed by a rinse
with double distilled water to remove residual traces of
iron. After 72 hours, A. fumigatus was shifted from iron
depleted to iron replete conditions by adding FeSO 4to
a final concentration of 10 μMF e S O 4.A. fumigatus was
then incubated for another 9 hours.
Mycelia were harvested from triplicate samples at 0
(control), 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330,
and 360 minutes after the addition of iron. Mycelia were
filtered through gauze and immediately flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Frozen mycelia were
subsequently ground to a fine powder using a mortar and
pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy plant
mini-kit. “Protocol: Purification of Total RNA from Plant
Cells and Tissues and Filamentous Fungi” was used along
with optional on-column DNase digestion step. Extracted
RNA was stored at -80°C. RNA integrity was assessed
by gel electrophoresis. Concentrations of RNA in each
sample were determined by spectrophotometry on aTable 4 Primers used for real-time qRT-PCR

synthesized following manufacturer’s instructions (Tetro
cDNA Synthesis Kit, Bioline). All incubations were car-
ried out in a thermacycler. Following synthesis, cDNA was
stored at -20°C.
qRT-PCR
Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) was performed using the cDNA as a template.
The constitutively expressed gene β-tubulin of A. fumi-
gatus was used as the house-keeping gene. See Table 4
for a list of primers for target genes. Real time qRT-PCR
was carried out in 20 μL reaction volumes on a BIO-
RAD iQTM5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System
machine. The real time qRT-PCR consisted of the follow-
ing a 3-step protocol: (95°C denaturation for 10 s, 55°C
annealing period for 30 s, 72°C extension for 45 s) ×40
cycles. Cycling involved an initial denaturing/polymerase
activation step (95°C for 3 min) and a final melting curve
analysis ( +0.5°C ramping ×81 cycles; 30 second incu-
bation between each cycle). SYBR Green (Bioline) was
used as the fluorescent reporter molecule in all reactions.
Real time qRT-PCR mixes consisted of 1 μLt e m p l a t e

for each biological replicate was carried out in techni-
cal duplicates. Standard errors were calculated to ensure
statistical accuracy.

rate in the course of studying the individual systems, ii)
the fact that these individual systems are so complicated
that scientists rarely have detailed knowledge about areas
outside those that they study, there is a huge imped-iment to implementing a systems approach in cellular
biochemistry, and iii) for laboratory scientists to fully

waytoorganizeandstoreimportantlaboratory-generated
data and information such as gene sequences, protein
characteristics, interaction partners, etc.; these are then
easily accessible via the Internet to the scientiﬁc commu-nity. Building on these resources and advancements has
been the development of tools to visualize and analyze
these data and, speciﬁcally, the entities that make up thecomplex, network-like structures of biological processes.
Amongstthemostwidelyusedtoolstovisualizebiological
networksistheopen-sourcesoftware,Cytoscape[13].
The information contained in the above database
resources (and visualized via Cytoscape) is limited in
that it is mostly static; biological systems however aredynamic in nature. Hence to fully understand the under-
lying mechanisms (and those of corresponding diseases),
thedynamicsoftheseprocessesneedtobeconsidered.
Computational modeling and simulation has been suc-
cessfully adopted in a number of ﬁelds to dramatically
reducedevelopmentcosts.Theuseofthesemoderntools
to organize and probe biological structure and function
has a high potential to provide the basis for new break-throughs in both basic understanding of cell function
and the development of disease therapies. The ability
to observe the actual dynamics of large scale biolog-ical systems increases the probability that, out of the
tens of thousands of combinations of interactions, unex-
pected points of intervention might be deciphered. TheCell Collective aims at providing an environment and
resource where the biomedical community, as a whole,
can more eﬀectively bring these exciting new computa-tional approaches to bear on cellular systems. The inte-
gration of computational and laboratory research has the
potential to lead to improved understanding of biologicalprocesses,mechanismsofdisease,anddrugdevelopment.
If a “systems approach” is to be successful, then there
must be a “system” into which the thousands of labora-
tory scientists all over the world can incorporate their
detailedlocalknowledgeofthepathwaystocreateaglobalmodelofbiochemicalpathways.Withsuchasystemsplat-
form, all local information would be far more accurate
if laboratory scientists would contribute their specializedexpertise into a system that enables the integration of
the currently dispersed knowledge. Hence, a collabora-
tive modeling platform has the potential to substantiallyimpactandmoveforwardbiomedicalresearch.
This is precisely the purpose of The Cell Collective.
The Cell Collective is an environment to model biolog-ical processes. The platform allows scientists to deposit
and track dynamical information about biological pro-
cessesandintegrateandinterrogatethisknowledgeinthecontext of the biological process as a whole. Laboratory
scientists can directly simulate large-scale models in real
time to not only help test and form new hypotheses for
their laboratory research, but also to make research moreeasily reproducible (through sharing their models with
collaborators). Furthermore, the creation and simulation
ofmodelsinTheCellCollectivedoesn’trequiredirectuse
of mathematics or programming – a substantial advance-ment in the ﬁeld [14]; this tool has been developed to
bring modeling into the hands of mainstream laboratory
scientists.
The role of The Cell Collective in the current landscape of
systems biology technology
As a result of the constant ﬂow of data from laborato-
ries, the success of biomedical research relies now, more
than ever, on computational and computer technologies.

Implementation
The Cell Collective is a server-based software imple-
mented in Java and powered by MySQL database. The
simulation engine is based on ChemChains which wasimplemented in C++ [33]. The user interface of The Cell
Collective was implemented primarily using JavaServer
Faces (http://www.javaserverfaces.org) and Primefaces(http://www.primefaces.org).
Computational framework and simulations
Models in The Cell Collective are based on a qualita-tive, rule-based mathematical framework. In this frame-work, each species can assume either an active or inac-
tive state. Which state a species assumes at any given
time point depends on a set of rules that take intoaccount the activation state of all immediate upstream
regulators.
The Bio-Logic Builder provides the user interface for
users to enter qualitative information about the regula-
tory mechanism of each species in a model, and sub-
sequently converts this information into an appropriatemathematical (algebraic) expression (manuscript submit-
ted). Before the simulation engine (ChemChains) can
simulate a model, the mathematical expressions of indi-
vidual species are converted into C++ (.cpp) ﬁles, which
aresubsequentlycompiledintoasingledynamicallibrary(.soﬁle).Thisdynamicallibraryencodestheentiremodel
which is subsequently simulated by ChemChains (see
Figure 1).
Though a discrete (active/inactive) mathematical
framework is used to represent the modeled biological
processes, ChemChains has been developed to enablesimulations of discrete models while using continuous
input/output data. In general, the activity levels of the
models’ individual constituents is measured as %ON.Depending on the context of the biological process being
simulated, this measure corresponds, for example, to
concentration or the fraction of biological species beingactiveatanygiventime.
In the case of real-time simulations, %ON of a species
represents its moving average activity, and is calculated
as the fraction of the active/inactive states over a slid-
ingwindow.ForsimulationsusingtheDynamicalAnalysisfeature, the activity levels of the individual species (or
%ON) also corresponds to the ratio of active/inactive
states, but is calculated once the dynamics of the modelsettle in a steady behavior (or an attractor as described
in great detail in [33]). In both the real time simula-
tions and dynamical analysis, %ON is used as a semi-quantitativewaytomeasurethedynamicsofthemodeled
biologicalprocesses.

Simulation performace
Weanalyzedtheperfomanceofindividualsimulationsfor
randomlygeneratedmodelsofdiﬀerentsizesanddiﬀerentcomplexities (in terms of network connectivity). Speciﬁ-
cally, we considered models with 10, 100, 500, and 1,000
nodes and network connectivities of 2, 5, 10, 20, and100. Note that for biological application, relatively small
(low single digit) connectivity is most realistic [32,34,35].
As can be seen Table 1, simulations in The Cell Collec-tive are relatively eﬃcient as the required computational
resources are in a linear relationship with the increasing
parametersofthegeneratednetworks.
Results and discussion

and subsequently simulate the models to further guide
their laboratory experiments. Conceptually, the platform
can bebrokenupinto three parts(Figure 2)thatform thebasis for the core functionality of the software: 1) inte-
grated Knowledge Base of protein dynamics generated
fromlaboratoryresearchinasinglerepository,2)integra-tion of this knowledge into mathematical representation
that allows visualization of the dynamics of the data (i.e.,
put it in motion via simulations), and 3) simulations andanalyses of the model dynamics. As can also be seen in
the ﬁgure, these three parts form a loop that is closed by
laboratory experimentation. The ﬁrst model in The CellCollective (available in for all users to simulate and build
upon) is one of the largest models of intracellular signal
transduction[32].Featuresavailableinthecurrentversionof The Cell Collective are described in more detail in the
followingsections.
Knowledge Base of interaction dynamics
When laboratory scientists produce new results, for
exampleregardingtheroleofoneproteininteractingwith
another protein, these results are usually published along
with thousands of other results generated by the scien-tiﬁc community. The publication of individual results in
isolation means that separate ﬁndings are not necessarily
absorbed, veriﬁed, analyzed, and integrated into theexisting knowledge. With the invention of various high-
throughput technologies, the gap between the amount
of knowledge produced and the ability of the scientiﬁc
communitytofullyutilizethisknowledgehasgrown[36].
The ﬁrst major component of The Cell Collective (as
highlighted in Figure 2) is a Knowledge Base which
enables laboratory scientists to contribute to the integra-
tion of knowledge about individual biological processesat the most local level which includes, for example, the
identiﬁcationofdirectprotein-proteininteractions.How-
ever, the goal of The Cell Collective is not to duplicateother well-established resources by providing extensive

cells. Instead, the aim of the platform is to extend staticknowledge and data into dynamical models; hence the
information provided in the Knowledge Base needs to
bedynamical in nature. This means that the information
(which is purely qualitative – see the Methods section)
contained in The Cell Collective Knowledge Base takes
intoaccountthedynamicalrelationshipbetweenalloftheinteracting partners. For example, let’s assume, there are
twopositiveregulators( XandY)ofahypotheticalspecies
Z. While in the context of a parts list, information about
the above species and interactions would be suﬃcient,
in order to abstract the biological process to a dynami-cal model, one needs to know the dynamical relationship
betweentheinteractingpartners.Forinstance,areboth X

suﬃcient to activate Z? This is the type of information
that is used to construct dynamical models in The Cell
Collective.
Basedonawidelyknownwiki-likeconcept,theKnowl-
edge Base module of the platform was developed to
allow laboratory scientists to contribute – collabora-
tively – their knowledge to the complete regulatorymechanisms of individual biological species. Because all
of the regulatory information forms the basis of the
modeled biological/biochemical process, and hence hasto be correct for the model to exhibit similar behav-
iors as seen in the laboratory, this process of aggre-
gating all known information about a species into one
place can also serve as a mechanism to identify pos-
sible contradictions or holes in the current knowledgeabout the regulatory mechanism of a particular species.
Using the previous hypothetical example, let’s assume
laboratory scientist Adiscovers that proteins Xand Y
arebothnecessary to activate species Z,b u ts c i e n t i s t
B’s laboratory results suggest eitherprotein XorYcan
suﬃciently activate Z(Figure 3). The process of inte-
grating all known information on species Zbecomes
crucial in discovering such discrepancies (or additional
missing information), which may have not been foundotherwise. Because the goal of The Cell Collective is
to also integrate this information into dynamical mod-
els, simulations of the large-scale model (which mighthave hundreds or thousands of additional componentsin it) can suggest whose data is more likely to be
correct. Assume that scientist Aadds his informa-
tion into the model and the model exhibits phenom-
ena similar to the ones seen in the laboratory, whereas
when the model is built with the data from scientistB’s experiments, the simulation dynamics of the over-
all model fails to resemble the known actions of the
real system. In such a case, new laboratory experimentswould be warranted, with a potential to produce more
insights into the regulatory mechanism of protein Z
(Figure3).
The sea of biological information has made it dif-
ﬁcult for the data to be veriﬁed on such an inte-
grated basis. We fully understand how some of the
most complex biological systems work only when the
experimental data is re-integrated into and seen inthe context of the entire system; a platform for inte-
gration of data is exactly what The Cell Collective
provides.
Dynamical information
Each species in The Cell Collective’s Knowledge Base has
a dedicated page where laboratory scientists can directly
deposit their knowledge regarding the species’ regulatorymechanisms. While the wiki-like format of the Knowl-
edge Base gives users the ability to input their data in
a free form which can be also interactively discussed,
each page is structured to help users organize and review
their data more eﬃciently. Because the wiki format is
