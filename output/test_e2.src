(received for review September 1, 2016)
Blood cells are derived from a common set of hematopoietic stem
cells, which differentiate into more specific progenitors of the myeloid
and lymphoid lineages, ultimately le a d i n gt od i f f e r e n t i a t e dc e l l s .T h i s
developmental process is controlled by a complex regulatory network
involving cytokines and their receptors, transcription factors, and
chromatin remodelers. Using public data and data from our own mo-
lecular genetic experiments (quant itative PCR, Western blot, EMSA) or
genome-wide assays (RNA-sequencing, ChIP-sequencing), we have
assembled a comprehensive regul atory network encompassing the
main transcription factors and si gnaling components involved in my-
eloid and lymphoid development. Focusing on B-cell and macrophage
development, we defined a qualitative dynamical model recapitulat-
ing cytokine-induced differentia tion of common progenitors, the ef-
fect of various reported gene knockdowns, and the reprogramming
of pre-B cells into macrophages indu ced by the ectopic expression of
specific transcription factors. The resulting network model can be
used as a template for the integration of new hematopoietic differ-
entiation and transdifferentiation data to foster our understanding
of lymphoid/myeloid cell-fate decisions.

cell reprogramming
Hematopoiesis is the process through which all blood cells are
produced and renewed, starting from a common population
of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (1). HSCs differentiate into
lineage-specific progenitors with restricted differentiation potential
and expressing specific surface markers (Fig. 1 A). Loss- or gain-of-
function experiments targeting transcription factors (TFs) or
signaling components have led to the identification of factors re-
quired for specific developmental steps. Some factors are required
for the development of entire lineages (e.g., Ikaros for lymphoid
cells), whereas others are needed only at late stages of cell-type
specification (e.g., the requirem ent for the paired-box factor Pax5
after the pro –B-cell stage). These factors cross-regulate each other to
activate one gene-expression program and silence alternative ones.
Although cell commitment to a specific lineage was long con-
sidered irreversible, recent reprogramming experiments emphasized
the pervasive plasticity of cellular states. Indeed, the ectopic ex-
pression of various regulatory factors (mainly TFs and signaling
components) can enforce the estab l i s h m e n to fn e wg e n e - e x p r e s s i o n
programs in many kinds of differentiated cells (2). Strikingly, pluri-
potency can be induced in somatic cells by forcing the expression of
a handful of TFs, enabling further d ifferentiation into any cell type
(3). In the hematopoietic system, T F-induced transdifferentiation
between erythroid and myeloid cells and between lymphoid and
myeloid cells has been described (4).
In this study, we focus on B-cell and macrophage specification
from multipotent progenitors (MPs) and on TF-induced trans-
differentiation between these lin eages. Ectopic expression of the
myeloid TF C/EBP α(CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha,
encoded by the Cebpa gene) can induce B cells to transdifferentiate
into macrophages (Fig. 1 A, red arrows) (5). C/EBP αis also requiredfor the transition from common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) to
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and mutation in
this gene can result in acute myeloid leukemia (6). Understanding
the molecular mechanisms by which such factors can induce cell-
fate decisions is of primary importance and might help in the
development of novel therapeutic strategies.
Computational modeling of regulatory networks is increasingly
recognized as a valuable approach to study cell-fate decisions. In-
deed, the integration of the available information about gene
regulation into a common formal framework allows us to identify
gaps in our current knowledge, as successfully shown in previous
studies on the differentiation of hematopoietic cells (7). Dynamic
analysis can reveal nontrivial properties, including transient phe-
nomena, and can be used to identify key regulatory factors or in-
teractions involved in the contro l of cell-fate commitment (8, 9).
Furthermore, genome-wide approa ches such as ChIP-sequencing
(ChIP-seq) can unveil novel regula tions to be further incorporated
in a gene-network model (10). He re, we combined a logical mul-
tilevel formalism, capturing the main qualitative aspects of the
dynamics of a regulatory network in the absence of quantitative
kinetic data (11), with a meta-an alysis of all available ChIP-seq
datasets for a selection of TFs, revealing tens of previously un-
known regulations. We then performed iterations of computational
simulations, followed by compari sons with experimental data and
adjustments of the model, to identify caveats in our model and to
test the effect of putative regulations in silico before confirming
them experimentally (Fig. 1 B).

Results
Gene Network Controlling B-Cell and Macrophage Specification. To
build a model of the gene-regulatory network controlling B-cell and
macrophage specification from common progenitors, we first per-
formed an extensive analysis of t he literature to identify the TFs
and signaling pathways controlling these events. The TF PU.1
(encoded by the Spi1gene) is required for the normal development
of both lymphoid and myeloid cells (12). The development of
common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) depends on the TFs Ikaros
(encoded by Ikzf1) and E2a (encoded by the transcription factor 3
gene Tcf3)( F i g .1 A) (13, 14). The B-cell lineage is further con-
trolled by Mef2c, the interleukine 7 receptor (IL7r), Ets1, Foxo1,
Ebf1, and Pax5 (15, 16, 17). The specification of the myeloid GMPs
depends on C/EBP α(6), which is regulated by Runx1 (runt-related
transcription factor 1) (18). Macroph age specification further relies
on the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor
(CSF1r), on the up-regulation of PU.1, and on Cebpb and the Id
proteins (including Id2) (19, 20) . The TFs Egr and Gfi1 repress each
other to specify macrophage versus granulocyte lineages (21); Gfi1
also is important for B-cell differentiation (22).
Finally, to distinguish among the different cell types, we further
consider the B-cell marker CD19, the macrophage marker Mac1
(also called “Cd11b, ”encoded by the Itgam gene), and the cytokine
receptor Flt3, which is expressed specifically on MPs and CLPs.
We then carried out an extensiv e review of the literature to
collect information about cross- regulations between the selected
factors and grouped these regula tions into four classes, depending
o nt h ea v a i l a b l ee v i d e n c e :( i) functional effect, e.g., an effect
inferred from gain- or loss-of-fun ction experiments (which could be
either direct or indirect); ( ii) physical interaction, e.g., TF binding
a tap r o m o t e ro re n h a n c e r ;( iii) physical and functional evidence,
suggesting a direct regulation; and ( iv) fully proven regulation, e.g.,
evidence of functional effect and p hysical interaction along with
reported binding-site mutations affecting the functional effect or
reporter assays demonstrating cis-regulatory activity. Altogether,
we gathered a total of 150 items of experimental evidence ( Dataset
S1) supporting 79 potential regulations ( Fig. S1 A).Many of these regulations are sustained only by functional
evidence. To assess whether they could correspond to direct
regulations, we analyzed public ChIP-seq datasets targeting each of
the TFs considered in our network, amounting to 43 datasets for 10
TFs in total ( Dataset S2 ). We systematically looked for peaks in the
“gene domain ”(23) coding for each component involved in the
network ( Materials and Methods ). This ChIP-seq meta-analysis
confirmed 26 direct regulations (Fig. 2 A, green or red cells with a
star) and pointed toward 66 additional potential transcriptional
regulations (gray cells with a star). For example, at the Spi1 locus,
we confirmed the binding of Ikaros at known enhancers, where it
was previously reported to limit the expression of Spi1 together
with a putative corepressor (24). Because we also found that Pax5,
Ebf1, and Foxo1 bind to the same sites (Fig. 2 B), we suggest that
these factors could act as corepressors. Ectopic expression of
Foxo1 in macrophages induced a reduction of Spi1 expression
(Fig. S1 B), further confirming this negative regulation.
C/EBP αDirectly Represses B-Cell Genes. We have previously reported
that C/EBP αcan enforce B-cell TF sile ncing by increasing the
expression of the histone demeth ylase Lsd1 (Kdm1a) and the his-
tone deacetylase Hdac1 at the protein level and that these enzymes
are required for the decommissi oning of B-cell enhancers and the
silencing of the B-cell program (25 ). Because key B-cell regulators
such as Foxo1, Ebf1, and Pax5 are repressed after 3 h of C/EBP α
induction ( Fig. S1 C), we wondered whether C/EBP αcould be di-
rectly responsible for this early effect. To verify this hypothesis, we
reanalyzed data from ChIP-seq for C/EBP αafter 3 h of induction
in a reprogrammable cell line (26). As expected, we detected
binding of C/EBP αat the cis-regulatory elements of Foxo1 (Fig.
2C),Ebf1,Pax5,IL7r,a n d Mef2c genes ( Fig. S1 C), supporting their
direct repression by C/EBP α.
Furthermore, C/EBP βalso can induce transdifferentiation of pre-
B cells (5), and it has been shown that C/EBP βcan rescue the
formation of granulocytes in C/EBP α-deficient mice (27). Moreover,
C/EBP βalmost always binds at C/EBP α-binding sites (Fig. 2 A), as
exemplified by the Spi1 locus (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest a

and is used to predict dynamical behaviors (cell phenotype, differentiation, reprogramming, and so forth). Predictions then are compared with expe rimental data;
when the predictions and experimental data agree, further predictive simulations are performed; when they do not agree, further regulations are inf erred from
ChIP-seq data and are integrated into the model until simulations fully agree with data.

redundancy between these two factors in the regulation of their
target genes (at least in those considered here), and we integrated
this redundancy in our model.
Dynamical Modeling Using Multilevel Logic. The core components
and regulations collected from our analysis of the literature and
ChIP-seq datasets were assembled in a regulatory graph using the
GINsim software (Fig. 3).
Validating all the predicted regulations (Fig. 2 A, gray cells with a
star) experimentally would be a daunting task. Instead, we focused
on a selection of these regulati ons (depicted by the gray arrows in
Fig. 3) and used dynamical modeling to assess their impact on
cell specification.
To transform our regulatory grap h into a predictive dynamical
model, we took advantage of a sophisticated logical (multilevel)
formalism. More precisely, we associated a discrete variable with
each regulatory component. These variables usually take two values
(0 or 1) but can be assigned more values whenever justified.Regulations are combined into logical rules using the Boolean op-
erators NOT, AND, and OR, to define the conditions enabling the
activation of each model component ( Materials and Methods ). This
formalism relies essentially on qua litative information and allows the
simulation of relatively large network models (encompassing up to a
few hundred components). It shou ld be noted that the value 0 does
n o tn e c e s s a r i l yi m p l yt h a taf a c t o ri sn o te x p r e s s e da ta l lb u tr a t h e r
that its level is insufficient to affe ct its targets significantly. PU.1
is the only factor for which we found clear evidence supporting
a distinction between two functio nal (non-0) levels (21). Conse-
quently, we assigned a ternary variable (taking the values 0, 1, or 2)
to this node and assigned Boolean variables (i.e., taking the values
0 or 1) to the other nodes.
Regarding the definition of the logical rules, we first considered
the regulations supported by both functional and physical evidence
(depicted as green and red arrows in Fig. 3). As a default, we re-
quired that all activators but no inhibitor to be present to enable
target activation and further adjusted the rules based on in-
formation gathered from the literature (see the rules in Materials
and Methods andDataset S3 ). As mentioned before, we then added
selected regulations inferred from our ChIP-seq meta-analysis
(depicted as gray arrows in Fig. 3) to refine our model.
Modeling Different Cell-Type Phenotypes. We first assessed whether
our model properly accounts for progenitor, B-cell, and macrophage
gene-expression patterns. Becaus e stable states capture the long-
term behavior associated with the acquisition of gene-expression
patterns during cell specification , we computed all the stable states
of our model using GINsim software (28) and compared them with
gene-expression data (Fig. 4 A) (29). We initially found that our
stable states were largely inconsistent with known patterns of gene
expression ( Fig. S2 A), revealing important caveats in the published
data on which we based our model.
A first caveat concerned the regu lation of Cebpa. Indeed, Cebpa
is not expressed in lymphoid cells, although its well-known activa-
tors PU.1 ( Spi1) and Runx1 are expressed in both B cells and

macrophages. Therefore, our model exhibited only Cebpa+stable
states ( Fig. S2 A), suggesting that an inhibitory regulation of Cebpa
was missing during lymphoid specification. Foxo1, a factor control-
ling the early steps of B-cell com mitment (30), sta nds as a relevant
candidate. To test this hypothes is, we performed ChIP-seq for
Foxo1 in our pre –B-cell line and observed binding at the Cebpa
promoter, suggesting a physical interaction and potential direct
regulation of Cebpa ( Fig. S2 B). To test if Foxo1 has a functional effect
on Cebpa expression, we ectopically expressed it in a macrophage cell
line (RAW) and found a significant down-regulation of Cebpa ( Fig.
S2C), suggesting a direct negative regulation of Cebpa by Foxo1.
We therefore refined our initial model by including this additional
regulation (see the rule associated with Cebpa in Dataset S3 ).
A second caveat revealed by our model analysis concerned the
regulation of Tcf3 (encoding E2a). Indeed, E2a was expressed in all
the stable states, even after Cebpa repression by Foxo1 was in-
cluded ( Fig. S2 D), although E2a has been shown to be expressed in
MPs and in lymphoid cells but not in myeloid cells. Moreover, the
only factor in our model expressed in MPs and regulating E2a is
PU.1, which is also known to be expressed in myeloid cells, thus
suggesting a missing regulation of E2a. However, despite our ef-
forts, we could not find any evidence for a myeloid repressor of
E2a in either the literature or our ChIP-seq data meta-analysis.
Turning to putative activators of E2a, we focused on Ikaros. In-
deed, like E2a, Ikaros is required for lymphoid development, and
its knockout entails a loss of lymphocytes similar to that seen with
E2a knockout. Interestingly, we found that Ikaros binds the E2a
promoter in B cells ( Fig. S2 E), suggesting a direct activation of E2a
by Ikaros. Hence, we further refined our model by including this
regulation (see the rule associated with E2a in Dataset S3 ).
More surprising was the high expression of Egr2 observed in pro/
pre-B cells. We also found expression of the related factor Egr1 in
two different datasets ( Fig. S2 FandG). It has been reported that
Egr1/2 cross-inhibits Gfi1, the fi rst favoring macrophage specifi-
cation and the second favoring B lineage (21). However, although
this study shows that Egr2 has an effect on the differentiationpotential of MPs, it does not dem onstrate that this factor is indeed
not expressed in B cells or that it can antagonize the expression of
B-cell genes. To assess the expression of Egr2, Egr1, and Gfi1 at
the protein level, we performed Wes tern blots for these proteins in
B cells and macrophages. We were able to detect all three proteins
in B cells ( Fig. S2 H), confirming the gene- expression data. We
therefore propose that some late B -cell factors ac tivate both Gfi1
and Egr2, overcoming their cross-inhibitions. Because Pax5 was the
only B-cell factor found in our meta-analysis to bind to Gfi1 and
Egr2 loci (Fig. 2 A), we consider it to be an activator of both Gfi1
and Egr2 (see corresponding rules in Dataset S3 ).
When analyzing the resulting refined model, we found that its
stable states correspond well to CLPs, GMPs, B-lineage cells, and
macrophages, as defined by the known patterns of gene expression
(Fig. 4 B). For some genes, we obtained apparent discrepancies
between expression data and stable state values; these discrep-
ancies can be attributed to model discretization (see SI Materials
and Methods for more details).
Our analysis points to previously unrecognized regulators of E2a
and Cebpa that are important at the onset of lymphoid and myeloid
specification and introduces refinements of the regulations of Egr2
and Gfi1. After incorporating these regulations in our model, we
used it to study the dynamics of B-cell and macrophage specification.
Specification of B-Cell and Macrophage Precursors from MPs. To improve
our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of hematopoietic
cell specification, we performed several iterations of hypothesis-
driven simulations and comparis ons with experimental data, fol-
lowed by model modifications to solve remaining discrepancies.
First, using GINsim software, we simulated the specification of
MPs, defined by the expression of Spi1,Runx1 ,Ikzf1,Gfi1,a n d Flt3.
In the absence of environmental signals, we found that our model
can lead to two different stable s tates corresponding to GMPs and
CLPs (Fig. 5 A). Upon stimulation with both CSF1 and IL7, the
system tends to two new stable states, corresponding to macro-
phages and B lineage cells, respectively. These simulations thus re-
capitulate the commitment of c ells to GMP- and CLP-associated
states and their loss of potential for alternative lineages.
Next, using stochastic simulations (see Materials and Methods and
ref. 31 for more details), we analyzed the evolution of the fraction of
cells expressing distinct factors ass ociated with specific cell lineages
starting with the same initial state (MPs) and environmental con-
ditions (initially no stimulation, followed by stimulation with Csf1
and Il7). Our results show two waves of gene activation for both
myeloid and lymphoid factors. The first wave corresponds to the
progenitor (GMP or CLP) expression programs, and the second one
corresponds to terminally differentiated cells (macrophages or B
cells) (Fig. 5 B,TopandMiddle ). The evolution of the different cell
populations (defined by the gene-e xpression signatures indicated in
Dataset S4 ) was consistent with our logical simulations, with a rapid
decrease of the MP population followed by the specification toward
GMPs and CLPs and then by their di fferentiation into macrophages
and B cells, respectively (Fig. 5 B,Bottom ). The proportions of
myeloid and lymphoid cells were ∼75 and 25%, respectively, in
qualitative agreement with the higher proportion of myeloid cells
present in the bone marrow (32). Tentatively, this asymmetry
could be encoded in the regulatory circuitry rather than merely
being the result of differences in proliferation rates. A sensitivity
analysis further revealed that the proportion of lymphoid and
myeloid cells was affected only by changes in the up-regulation
rates of Cebpa, Foxo1, and E2a ( Fig. S2 I), supporting the key
function of Cebpa and Foxo1 in the commitment decision (E2a
being required for Foxo1 expression).
To obtain more comprehensive insights into the alternative
trajectories underlying myeloid and lymphoid lineage specification,
we clustered the logical states (Fig. 5 A) to generate a hierarchical
(acyclic) graph (28) in which all the states with a similar potential
(i.e., leading to the same attractors or differentiated states) are

clustered in a single node (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, this analysis
shows that the cell decision between GMPs and CLPs depends
mainly on the concurrent activation of Cebpa and Foxo1, em-
phasizing the importance of these factors in early hematopoietic
progenitor specification.
Simulation of Documented Genetic Perturbations. Next, we simulated
the effects of well-documented gene l oss-of-function experiments on
progenitor cell specification. Our sim ulations faithfully recapitulated
the effects of various published gene-ablation experiments ( Dataset
S5). For example, Cebpa knockout in MPs results in the loss of the
stable states associated with GMPs and macrophages (Fig. 5 D), in
agreement with the reported imp act in vivo (33). Pax5 knockout
does not affect the formation of the progenitors but blocks the de-
velopment of the B-cell lineage at the pro-B stage and prevents the
acquisition of the terminal B-cell marker Cd19 (Fig. 5 E), in agree-
ment with published experimental data (34).
However, the simulation of Spi1 knockout does not reproduce
the reported viability of B cells in Spi1-knockout mice (35). This
discrepancy arose because, in our model, Spi1 is required for theexpression of the B-cell factors E2a, Ebf1, and Il7r. Introducing
additional cross-activat ions between the B-cell factors and releasing
the requirement of Runx1 for Ebf1 up-regulation and of Mef2c for
Il7r activation could rescue the expression of the B-cell factors.
When we refined the corresponding rules accordingly ( Dataset S3 ),
the resulting model showed a stable state corresponding to B-cell
patterns in the Spi1-knockout condition. However, such patterns
cannot be reached from a Spi1−/−MP state, because the cells end
up with a complete collapse of gene expression (Fig. 5 F).
Dynamical Analysis of Transdifferentiation. Next, we analyzed in
silico the transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages upon
C/EBP αinduction. We first simulated the behavior of B cells under
a permanent induction of C/EBP αin the presence of CSF1 and
IL7. The system converged towa rd a single stable state corre-
sponding to macrophages, which does not further require induction
of exogenous C/EBP α(Fig. S3 A), in accordance with published
reports (5).
We then focused on the effect of transient inductions of C/EBP α.

line that a 24-h induction of C/EBP αfollowed by washout of the
inducer was sufficient to trigger irreversible reprogramming (36).
Shorter inducer exposure times led to the formation of two pop-
ulations: one converting into macrophages, and the other initiating
transdifferentiation but returning to a B-cell state. A simulation of
this process testing all possible pulse durations at once ( Materials
and Methods ) confirms that, depending on the duration of C/EBP α
induction, B cells can be reprogrammed to macrophages or can go
back to a B-cell state (the state tra nsition graph for such simulations
cannot be displayed because it contains more than 30,000 states).
Aiming at identifying the commitment point of reprogramming,
we further analyzed the resulting hie rarchical transition graph (Fig.
6A). Because endogenous Cebpa bec omes activated very late
during transdifferentiation (at about 48 h; see Fig. S3 B), notably
after the commitment point ( ∼24 h), we focused on the Cebpa−
states (i.e., with Cebpa =0) leading to the sole macrophage stable
state (Fig. 6 A,Lower ). Some of these states expressed Foxo1,
suggesting that the inhibition of Cebpa by Foxo1 can be overcome,
in contrast with what happens during the specification of GMPs
and CLPs from MPs (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, we found that these
Cebpa−states show low constraints on B-cell factors, because only
Pax5 must be down-regulated. Furthermore, all Cebpa−states
expressed Cebpb and Spi1 at a high level, whereas Pax5 was the
only B-cell factor required to be inactivated. Finally, some states
were found to be Csf1r−, but only when Gfi1 is silenced (along with
its activator Ikaros, at least when its repressor Egr2 is not
expressed), because Gfi1 can block high Spi1 expression (21).
Turning to stochastic simulations, we observed the expected loss
of B-cell and gain of macrophage phenotypes for both permanent
and transient C/EBP α-induced expression ( Fig. S3 C). However,
these more quantitative simulati ons also revealed some inconsis-
tencies. ( i) Cebpa is reactivated very rapidly; this discrepancy can be
circumvented by lowering the kin etic rate of Cebpa up-regulation.(ii) The timing of the repression of B-cell genes and that of the loss
of CD19 marker roughly coincide; however, we observed that B-cell
genes are transcriptionally repressed very rapidly (after 3 h; see Fig.
S1C), whereas CD19 protein is lost only after 24 h (36). ( iii)O u r
model also does not properly capture the fact that short C/EBP α
pulses result in the loss of CD19+cells, which are regained after
Cebpa inactivation (36), sugges ting that reversion of reprogram-
ming is possible after short induction.
The last two points suggest that B-cell TFs are rapidly down-
regulated at the transcriptional level but that the corresponding
proteins are retained in transdiffe rentiating cells for longer times,
facilitating reversion of the repr ogramming. To address this possi-
bility, we performed a ChIP-seq for Ebf1 at several time points upon
permanent induction of Cebpa. Indeed, although Ebf1 RNA de-
creased by 50% after 3 h of C/EBP αinduction ( Fig. S1 C), we ob-
served that Ebf1 binding was lost only after 24 h of induction (Fig.
6B). We therefore added a delay in B-cell factor protein degrada-
tion to our model ( Materials and Methods ), resulting in a better fit
with the observed timing of events during transdifferentiation for
both permanent and transient C/EBP αinduction (Fig. 6 C).
In conclusion, our analysis suggests an important role for the
Egr2-Gfi1-PU.1 –and C/EBP β-PU.1 –positive loops in the irre-
versible commitment during transdifferentiation and emphasizes
the importance of the balance between protein degradation and
transcriptional regulation kinetics in the reversibility of the
reprogramming.

Finally, we analyzed the effects of var ious TF gain-/loss-of-functions
on Cebpa-induced reprogramming, combining C/EBP αinduction
with a knockdown of Spi1 or Cebpb or with a constitutive ex-
pression of E2a, Ebf1, Pax5, Foxo1, or Gfi1 (Fig. 7). As pre-
viously shown (26), only the Spi1 knockdown is able to block

transdifferentiation fully under permanent induction of C/EBP α.
The analysis of the HTG obtained for transient C/EBP αinduction
inSpi1−cells indicates that, when Ebf1 is inhibited, the expression
of all genes collapses ( Fig. S3 D). Cebpb knockdown does not
block pulse-induced transdifferentiation, but then all committed
cell states become Cebpa+, suggesting that Cebpb knockdown
could impair commitment if C/EBP αinduction is stopped before
the reactivation of endogenous Cebpa; this hypothesis remains
to be tested. Interestingly, the simulation of the constitutive
expression of both Foxo1 and Pax5 results in states expressing a
mixture of myeloid and lymphoid genes, pointing toward ab-
errant reprogramming ( Fig. S3 E).
Discussion
Models of regulatory networks ar e classically built from detailed
reviews of the literature. Des pite the massive use of high-
throughput assays in the last decade, taking advantage of such data
for the construction of new models or to improve preexisting ones
remains challenging. Here we comb ined a meta-analysis of ChIP-
seq data with a dynamical model analysis to uncover important
regulations. Such a me ta-analysis requires an extensive manual
curation of the datasets.
It would be tempting to explore the different logical rules in a
more unsupervised way by building all possible models with all
combinations of regulations and testing their accuracy in silico.
Although this approach has been used previously (37), it can be
applied only to a subset of possible combinations (e.g., testing the
addition or removal of regulations under a general logical rule,
such as requiring all activators but none of the inhibitors to enable
the activation of a component) and impose certain technical
constraints (e.g., limitation to Boolean variables or to synchronousupdating). In this study, we first built a model based on published
data and then used it to identify caveats in our current knowledge;
these caveats then were addressed by exploiting relevant high-
throughput datasets.
Our integrative modeling approach enabled us to clarify several
aspects of the regulatory network controlling lymphoid and mye-
loid cell specification. First, although E2a was known to be a
master regulator of lymphoid cell s pecification [required for both
B- and T-cell specification (38)], the mechanism of its activation
remained unclear, as did the mechanism of its repression in mye-
loid cells. In this respect, our analysis points to Ikaros as a main
activator that is itself activated by Mef2c during lymphoid differ-
entiation and repressed by Cebpa during myeloid differentiation.
In our model, Flt3 is considered a mere marker of multipotent/
lymphoid progenitors. Although the Flt3 pathway has been shown
to be required for lymphoid development and, more particularly, for
the expansion of the CLP population, its impact on cell fate (i.e.,
beyond proliferation and cell sur vival) remains unclear. Likewise,
ectopic Flt3 signaling has been shown to inactivate C/EBP αthrough
posttranslational modifications (3 9), but it is unclear whether this
inactivation occurs in physiological conditions.
The Egr2 and Gfi1 cross-inhibitory circuit has been shown to be
important in the early decision between macrophage and B-cell
f a t e s( 2 1 ) .O u ra n a l y s i ss u g g e s t st h a tt h i sc i r c u i tb e c o m e si r r e l e v a n t
after B-cell commitment, enabling high expression of Egr2 in both
pre-B and mature B cells. We therefore proposed that Pax5 can act
as an activator of both factors, allowing their coexpression, al-
though it is possible that other factors are involved also.
Concerning the regulation of Cebpa, our work emphasizes the
absence of known repressors in lymphoid cells. Ebf1 has been
proposed to fulfill this function (4 0). However, the facts that CLPs
lack myeloid potential and show no Cebpa expression and that a
depletion of IL7R impedes the activation of Ebf1 but still allows
B-cell specification until the pre -B stage (which is devoid of mye-
loid potential) suggest that another factor acting more upstream
represses Cebpa. Mef2c has been shown to counteract myeloid
potential (15), but we could not detect any binding at the Cebpa
locus. We therefore proposed Foxo1 as a candidate repressor.
Thus, according to our model, commitment during normal differ-
entiation of MPs would be controlled mainly by the Cebpa –Foxo1
cross-inhibitory circuit. Hence, Foxo1−/−CLPs could show some
myeloid potential. However, other factors could be involved also.
In particular, the delay in Cebpa re-expression during reprogram-
ming (long after Foxo1 inactivation) suggests an additional mech-
anism, possibly involving epigenetic modifications.
Materials and Methods
ChIP-Seq Meta-Analysis. ChIP-seq data were collected from public databases
(Gene Expression Omnibus), and SRR (sequenced reads run) accession numbers
were gathered in Dataset S2 and were automatically downloaded using the
Aspera Connect browser plug-in. SRA (Sequence Read Archive format) files
were converted in FASTQ using fastq -dump and were mapped onto the mouse
mm10 genome using STAR version 2.4.0f1 (41) (see parameters in SI Materials
and Methods ). Duplicated reads were removed using picard ( broadinstitute.
github.io/picard/ ). Bigwig tracks were made using Deeptools bamcoverage (42).
Peak calling was performed using macs2 (43). Gene domains were defined as in
ref. 23, and promoter regions were defined as the TF start site −5k b /+1k b ,
extended up to the next promoter regions or up to 1 Mb in the absence of other
promoter regions. Peaks to gene domain as sociations were performed using R.
Gene Network Modeling and Simulations. The logical model of hematopoietic
cell specification was built using GINsim version 2.9 software (44), which is freely
available from ginsim.org . All logical simulations (leading to state transition
graphs and hierarchical transition graphs) and computation of stable states
were performed with GINsim. Stochastic simulations of cell populations were
performed using MaBoSS (31). More detailed information can be found in SI
Materials and Methods . The model can be downloaded from the BioModels
database under accession number 1610240000 and from the logical model
repository on GINsim website ( ginsim.org ).

Abstract
Background: Modeling of molecular ne tworks is necessary to understand their dynamical
properties. While a wealth of information on mo lecular connectivity is avai lable, there are still
relatively few data regarding th e precise stoichiometry and kineti cs of the biochemical reactions
underlying most molecular networks. This imba lance has limited the development of dynamical
models of biological networks to a small number of well-characte rized systems. To overcome this
problem, we wanted to develop a methodology that would systematically create dynamical models
of regulatory networks where the flow of inform ation is known but the biochemical reactions are
not. There are already diverse me thodologies for modeling regulatory networks, but we aimed to
create a method that could be completely standardized, i.e. independent of the network under
study, so as to use it systematically.
Results: We developed a set of equations that can be used to translate the graph of any regulatory
network into a continuous dynamica l system. Furthermore, it is also possible to locate its stable
steady states. The method is based on the cons truction of two dynamical systems for a given
network, one discrete and one cont inuous. The stable steady states of the discrete system can be
found analytically, so they are used to locate th e stable steady states of the continuous system
numerically. To provide an example of the applic ability of the method, we used it to model the
regulatory network controlling T helper cell differentiation.
Conclusion: The proposed equations have a form that  permit any regulatory network to be
translated into a continuous dynamical system, and also find its steady stable states. We showed
that by applying the method to the T helper regulatory network it  is possible to find its known
states of activation, which corr espond the molecular profiles observed in the precursor and
effector cell types.
Background
The increasing use of high throughput technologies in dif-
ferent areas of biology has generated vast amounts of
molecular data. This has, in turn, fueled the drive to incor-porate such data into pathways and networks of interac-tions, so as to provide a context within which moleculesoperate. As a result, a wealth of connectivity information
is available for multiple biological systems, and this has
been used to understand some global properties of bio-
logical networks, including connectivity distribution [1],recurring motifs [2] and modularity [3]. Such informa-tion, while valuable, provides only a static snapshot of aPublished: 16 March 2006

network. For a better understanding of the functionality of
a given network it is important to study its dynamical prop-
erties. The consideration of dynamics allows us to answerquestions related to the number, nature and stability ofthe possible patterns of activation, the contribution ofindividual molecules or interactions to establishing suchpatterns, and the possibility of simulating the effects of
loss- or gain-of-function mutations, for example.
Mathematical modeling of metabolic networks requires
specification of the biochemical reactions involved. Eachreaction has to incorporate the appropriate stoichiometriccoefficients to account for the principle of mass conserva-
tion. This characteristic simplifies modeling, because it
implies that at equilibrium every node of the metabolicnetwork has a total mass flux of zero [4,5]. There are cases,however, where the underlying biochemical reactions arenot known for large parts of a pathway, but the direction
of the flow of information is known, which is the case forso-called regulatory networks (see for example [6,7]). Inthese cases, the directionality of signaling is sufficient fordeveloping mathematical models of how the patterns ofactivation and inhibition determine the state of activationof the network (for a review, see [8]).
When cells receive external stimuli such as hormones,
mechanical forces, changes in osmolarity, membranepotential etc., there is an internal response in the form ofmultiple intracellular signals that may be buffered or mayeventually be integrated to trigger a global cellular
response, such as growth, cell division, differentiation,
apoptosis, secretion etc. Modeling the underlying molec-ular networks as dynamical systems can capture this chan-neling of signals into coherent and clearly identifiableMethodologyFigure 1

stable cellular behaviors, or cellular states. Indeed, quali-
tative and semi-quantitative dynamical models providevaluable information about the global properties of regu-latory networks. The stable steady states of a dynamicalsystem can be interpreted as the set of all possible stablepatterns of expression that can be attained within the par-
ticular biological network that is being modeled. The
advantages of focusing the modeling on the stable steadystates of the network are two-fold. First, it reduces thequantity of experimental data required to construct amodel, e.g. kinetic and rate limiting step constants,
because there is no need to describe the transitory
response of the network under different conditions, only
the final states. Second, it is easier to verify the predictionsof the model experimentally, since it requires stable cellu-lar states to be identified; that is, long-term patterns ofactivation and not short-lived transitory states of activa-
tion that may be difficult to determine experimentally.
In this paper we propose a method for generating qualita-
tive models of regulatory networks in the form of contin-uous dynamical systems. The method also permits the
stable steady states of the system to be localized. The pro-
cedure is based on the parallel construction of twodynamical systems, one discrete and one continuous, forthe same network, as summarized in Figure 1. The charac-teristic that distinguishes our method from others used tomodel regulatory networks (as summarized in [8]) is that
the equations used here, and the method deployed to ana-
lyze them, are completely standardized, i.e. they are not
network-specific. This feature permits systematic applica-tion and complete automation of the whole process, thusThe Th networkFigure 2

speeding up the analysis of the dynamical properties of
regulatory networks. Moreover, in contrast to methodolo-gies for the automatic analysis of biochemical networks(as in [9]; for example), our method can be applied to net-
works for which there is a lack of stoichiometric informa-
tion. Indeed, the method requires as sole input theinformation regarding the nature and directionality of theregulatory interactions. We provide an example of theapplicability of our method, using it to create a dynamicalmodel for the regulatory network that controls the differ-
entiation of T helper (Th) cells.
Results and discussion
Equations 1 and 3 (see Methods) provide the means for
transforming a static graph representation of a regulatorynetwork into two versions of a dynamical system, a dis-crete and a continuous description, respectively. As an
example, we applied these equations to the Th regulatory
network, shown in Figure 2. Briefly, the vertebrateimmune system contains diverse cell populations, includ-ing antigen presenting cells, natural killer cells, and B andT lymphocytes. T lymphocytes are classified as either Thelper cells (Th) or T cytotoxic cells (Tc). T helper cells
take part in cell- and antibody-mediated immune
responses by secreting various cytokines, and they are fur-ther sub-divided into precursor Th0 cells and effector Th1and Th2 cells, depending on the array of cytokines thatthey secrete [10]. The network that controls the differenti-
ation from Th0 towards the Th1 or Th2 phenotypes israther complex, and discrete modeling has been used tounderstand its dynamical properties [11,12]. In this work
we used an updated version of the Th network, the molec-
ular basis of which is included in the Methods. Also, weimplement for the first time a continuous model of the Thnetwork.
By applying Equation 1 to the network in Figure 2, we
obtained Equation 2, which constitutes the discrete ver-
sion of the dynamical system representing the Th net-work. Similarly, the continuous version of the Th networkwas obtained by applying Equation 3 to the network inFigure 2. In this case, however, some of the resulting equa-tions are too large to be presented inside the main text, sowe included them as the Additional file 1. Moreover,
instead of just typing the equations, we decided to present
them in a format that might be used directly to run simu-lations. The continuous dynamical system of the Th net-work is included as a plain text file that is able to run onthe numerical computation software package GNUOctave http://www.octave.org
.
The high non-linearity of Equation 3 implies that the con-
tinuous version of the dynamical model has to be studiednumerically. In contrast, the discrete version can be stud-Table 1: Stable steady states of the dynamical systems. a

ied analytically by using generalized logical analysis,
allowing all its stable steady states to be located (see Meth-
ods). In our example, the discrete system described byEquation 2 has three stable steady states (see Table 1).Importantly, these states correspond to the molecular pro-files observed in Th0, Th1 and Th2 cells. Indeed, the firststable steady state reflects the pattern of Th0 cells, which
are precursor cells that do not produce any of the
cytokines included in the model (IFN- β, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-
12, IL-18 and IL-4). The second steady state representsTh1 cells, which show high levels of activation for IFN- γ,
IFN-γR, SOCS1 and T-bet, and with low (although not
zero) levels of JAK1 and STAT1. Finally, the third steadystate corresponds to the activation observed in Th2 cells,
with high levels of activation for GATA3, IL-10, IL-10R, IL-
4, IL-4R, STAT3 and STAT6.
Equation 3 defines a highly non-linear continuous
dynamical system. In contrast with the discrete system,these continuous equations have to be studied numeri-
cally. Numerical methods for solving differential equa-
tions require the specification of an initial state, since theyproceed via iterations. In our method, we propose to usethe stable steady states of the discrete system as the initialstates to solve the continuous system that results from
application of equation 3 to a given network. We used a
standard numerical simulation method to solve the con-tinuous version of the Th model (see Methods). Startingalternatively from each of the three stable steady statesfound in the discrete model, i.e. the Th0, Th1 and Th2
states, the continuous system was solved numerically
until it converged. The continuous system converged to
values that could be compared directly with the stablesteady states of the discrete system (Table 1). Note that theTh0 and Th2 stable steady states fall in exactly the sameposition for both the discrete and the continuous dynam-ical systems, and in close proximity for the Th1 state. Thisfinding highlights the similarity in qualitative behavior of
the two models constructed using equations 1 and 3,
despite their different mathematical frameworks.
Despite the qualitative similarity between the discrete and
continuous systems, there is no guarantee that the contin-uous dynamical system has only three stable steady states;
there might be others without a counterpart in the discrete
system. To address this possibility, we carried out a statis-tical study by finding the stable steady states reached bythe continuous system starting from a large number of ini-Table 2: Regions of the state space reached by the continuous vers ion of the Th model, as revealed by a large number of simulat ions

tial states. The continuous system was run 50,000 times,
each time with the nodes in a random initial state withinthe closed interval between 0 and 1. In all cases, the sys-tem converged to one of only three different regions
(Table 2), corresponding to the above-mentioned Th0,
Th1 and Th2 states. These results still do not eliminate thepossibility that other stable steady states exist in the con-tinuous system. Nevertheless, they show that if such addi-tional stable steady states exist, their basin of attractions isrelatively small or restricted to a small region of the state
space.
The three steady states of the continuous system are stable,
since they can resist small perturbations, which createtransitory responses that eventually disappear. Figure 3ashows a simulation where the system starts in its Th0 state
and is then perturbed by sudden changes in the values of
IFN-γ and IL-4 consecutively. Note that the system is capa-
ble of absorbing the perturbations, returning to the origi-nal Th0 state. If a perturbation is large enough, however,it may move the system from one stable steady state toanother. If the system is in the Th0 state and IFN- γ is tran-
siently changed to it highest possible value, namely 1, the
whole system reacts and moves to its Th1 state (Figure
3b). A large second perturbation by IL-4, now occurringwhen the system is in its Th1 state, does not push the sys-tem into another stable steady state, showing the stabilityof the Th1 state. Conversely, if the large perturbation of IL-4 occurs when the system is in the Th0 state, it moves the
system towards the Th2 state (Figure 3c). In this case, a
second perturbation, now in IFN- γ, creates a transitory
response that is not strong enough to move the systemaway from the Th2 state, showing the stability of thissteady state. These changes from one stable steady state to
another reflect the biological capacities of IFN- γ and IL-4
to act as key signals driving differentiation from Th0
towards Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively[10]. Furthermore,note that the Th1 and Th2 steady states are more resistantto large perturbations than the Th0 state, a characteristicthat represents the stability of Th1 and Th2 cells under dif-ferent experimental conditions.

The whole process resulted in the creation of a model with
qualitative characteristics fully comparable to those foundin the experimental Th system. Notably, the model useddefault values for all parameters. Indeed, the continuous
dynamical system of the Th network has a total of 58
parameters, all of which were set to the default value of 1,and one parameter (the gain of the sigmoids) with adefault value of 10. This set of default values sufficed tocapture the correct qualitative behavior of the biologicalsystem, namely, the existence of three stable steady statesthat represent Th0, Th1 and Th2 cells. Readers can run
simulations on the model by using the equations pro-
vided in the "Th_continuous_model.octave.txt" file. Thefile was written to allow easy modification of the initialstates for the simulations, as well as the values of allparameters.
Analysis of previously published regulatory networks
related to Th cell differentiation
We wanted to compare the results from our method (Fig-
ure 1) as applied to our proposed network (Figure 2) withsome other similar networks. The objective of this com-
parison is to show that our method imposes no restric-tions on the number of steady states in the models.Therefore, if the procedure is applied to wrongly recon-
structed networks, the results will not reflect the general
characteristics of the biological system. While there havebeen multiple attempts to reconstruct the signaling path-ways behind the process of Th cell differentiation, theyhave all been carried out to describe the molecular com-ponents of the process, but not to study the dynamicalbehavior of the network. As a result, most of the schematic
representations of these pathways are not presented as
regulatory networks, but as collections of molecules withdifferent degrees of ambiguity to describe their regulatoryinteractions. To circumvent this problem, we chose fourpathways with low numbers of regulatory ambiguitiesand translated them as signaling networks (Figures 4
through 7).

The stable steady states of the resulting discrete and con-
tinuous models are presented in Tables 3 through 6.
Notice that none of these four alternative networks could
generate the three stable steady states representing Th0,Th1 and Th2 cells. Two networks reached only two stablesteady states, while two others reached more than three.Notably, all these four networks included one state repre-senting the Th0 state, and at least one representing theTh2 state. The absence of a Th1 state in two of the net-
works might reflect the lack of a full characterization of
the IFN-γ signaling pathway at the time of writing the cor-
responding papers.
It is important to note that the failure of these four alter-
native networks to capture the three states representing Th
cells is not attributable to the use of very simplistic and/or
outdated data. Indeed, the network in Figure 6 comesfrom a relatively recent review, while that in Figure 7 israther complex and contains five more nodes than ourown proposed network (Figure 2). All this stresses theimportance of using a correctly reconstructed network to
develop dynamical models, either with our approach or
any other.
Conclusion
There is a great deal of interest in the reconstruction andanalysis of regulatory networks. Unfortunately, kinetic
information about the elements that constitute a networkor pathway is not easily gathered, and hence the analysis
of its dynamical properties (via simulation packages such
as [13]) is severely restricted to a small set of well-charac-
terized systems. Moreover, the translation from a static toa dynamical representation normally requires the use of anetwork-specific set of equations to represent the expres-sion or concentration of every molecule in the system.
We herein propose a method for generating a system of
ordinary differential equations to construct a model of a
regulatory network. Since the equations can be unambig-uously applied to any signaling or regulatory network, theconstruction and analysis of the model can be carried outsystematically. Moreover, the process of finding the stablesteady states is based on the application of an analytical
method (generalized logical analysis [14,15] on a discrete
version of the model), followed by a numerical method(on the continuous version) starting from specific initialstates (the results obtained from the logical analysis). Thischaracteristic allows a fully automated implementation ofour methodology for modeling. In order to construct the
equations of the continuous dynamical system with the
exclusive use of the topological information from the net-work, the equations have to incorporate a set of defaultvalues for all the parameters. Therefore, the resultingmodel is not optimized in any sense. However, the advan-tage of using Equation 3 is that the user can later modify
the parameters so as to refine the performance of the

model, approximating it to the known behavior of the
biological system under study. In this way, the user has a
range of possibilities, from a purely qualitative model to
one that is highly quantitative.
There are studies that compare the dynamical behavior of
discrete and continuous dynamical systems. Hence, it isknown that while the steady state of a Boolean model will
correspond qualitatively to an analogous steady state in a
continuous approach, the reverse is not necessarily true.Moreover, periodic solutions in one representation maybe absent in the other [16]. This discrepancy between thediscrete and continuous models is more evident for steadystates where at least one of the nodes has an activation
state precisely at, or near, its threshold of activation.
Because of this characteristic, discrete and continuousmodels for a given regulatory network differ in the totalnumber of steady states [17]. For this reason, our methodfocuses on the study of only one type of steady state;namely, the regular stationary points [18]. These points
do not have variables near an activation threshold, and
they are always stable steady states. Moreover, it has beenshown that this type of stable steady state can be found indiscrete models, and then used to locate their analogousstates in continuous models of a given genetic regulatorynetwork [19].
It is beyond the scope of this paper to present a detailed
mathematical analysis of the dynamical system describedby Equation 3. Instead, we present a framework that canhelp to speed up the analysis of the qualitative behaviorof signaling networks. Under this perspective, the useful-ness of our method will ultimately be determined through
building and analyzing concrete models. To show the
capabilities of our proposed methodology, we applied itto analysis of the regulatory network that controls differ-entiation in T helper cells. This biological system was wellsuited to evaluating our methodology because the net-
work contains several known components, and it has
three alternative stable patterns of activation. Moreover, it
is of great interest to understand the behavior of this net-work, given the role of T helper cell subsets in immunityand pathology [20]. Our method applied to the Th net-work generated a model with the same qualitative behav-ior as the biological system. Specifically, the model has
three stable states of activation, which can be interpreted
as the states of activation found in Th0, Th1 and Th2 cells.In addition, the system is capable of being moved fromthe Th0 state to either the Th1 or Th2 states, given a suffi-ciently large IFN- γ or IL-4 signal, respectively. This charac-
teristic reflects the known qualitative properties of IFN- γ
and IL-4 as key cytokines that control the fate of T helper
cell differentiation.
Regarding the numerical values returned by the model, it
is not possible yet to evaluate their accuracy, given that (toour knowledge) no quantitative experimental data are
available for this biological system. The resulting model,
then, should be considered as a qualitative representation
of the system. However, representing the nodes in the net-work as normalized continuous variables will eventuallypermit an easy comparison with quantitative experimen-tal data whenever they become available. Towards thisend, the equations in our methodology define a sigmoid
function, with values ranging from 0 to 1, regardless of the
values of assigned to the parameters in the equations. Thischaracteristic has been used before to represent andmodel the response of signaling pathways [21,22]. It isimportant to note, however, that the modification of theparameters allow the model to be fitted against experi-
mental data.
One benefit of a mathematical model of a particular bio-
logical network is the possibility of predicting the behav-Table 5: Stable steady states of the signaling network in Figure 6

ior of complex experimental setups. Therefore, it is
important to be aware of its limitations beforehand, to
avoid generating experimental data that cannot be han-
dled by the model. The method we present in this paperhas been developed to obtain the number and relativeposition of the stable steady states of a regulatory network.Equations 1 and 3 include a number of parameters thatallow the response of the model to be fine-tuned, but the
equations were not designed to describe the transitory
responses of molecules with great detail. Therefore, failureto predict a stable steady state with high numerical accu-racy should not be interpreted as a failure of the approachpresented here. By contrast, failure to describe and/or pre-dict the number and approximate location of stablesteady states under a wide range of values for the parame-
ters would call the validity of the reconstruction of a par-
ticular network into question. Here, however, it isessential to establish the validity of the network used asinput. Indeed, we applied our method to four alternativeforms of the network that regulates Th cell differentiation.The alternative networks (Figures 4 through 7) were taken
from previously published attempts to discover the
molecular basis of this differentiation process. Originally,such networks were not developed with the idea of study-ing dynamical properties. It is not surprising, then, thatthese networks do not reflect the existence of three stable
steady states, representing the molecular states of Th0,
Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. In these cases, the failure
to find the correct stable steady states is not a problem inthe modeling methodology, but a problem in the infer-ence of the regulatory network.
In conclusion, we have shown that the creation of a
dynamical model of a regulatory network can be consid-
erably simplified with the aid of a standardized set ofequations, where the feature that distinguishes one mole-cule from another is the number of regulatory inputs.Such standardization permits a continuous dynamicalsystem to be systematically and analytically constructedtogether with a basic analysis of its global properties,
based exclusively on the information provided by the con-
nectivity of the network. While the use of a standardizedset of functions to model a network may severely restrictthe capability to fit specific datasets, we believe that theloss in flexibility is balanced by the possibility of rapidlydeveloping models and gaining knowledge of the dynam-
ical behavior of a network, especially in those cases where
few kinetic data are available. Thus, we provide a methodfor incorporating the dynamical perspective in the analy-sis of regulatory networks, using the topological informa-Table 6: Stable steady states of the signaling network in Figure 7

tion of a network, without the need to collect extensive
time-series or kinetic data.
Methods
Molecular basis of the Th network topology
The following paragraphs detail the evidence used to inferthe topology of the Th regulatory network, updating thedata summarized in [11]. Th1 cells are producers of IFN- γ
[10,23], which acts on its target cells by binding to a cell-
membrane receptor [24-26] to start a signaling cascade,
which involves JAK1 and STAT-1 [27-29]. STAT-1 can beactivated by a number of ligands besides IFN- γ, but
importantly, it cannot be activated by IL-4 [30], which isa major Th2 signal. In contrast, STAT-1 plays a role inmodulating IL-4, being an intermediate in the negativeregulation of IFN- γ exerted on IL-4 expression [31]. Differ-
ent signals converge in STAT-1, among them that of IFN-
β/IFN-βR [32]. The IFN- γ signaling continues downstream
to activate SOCS-1 in a STAT-1-dependent pathway[33,34]. SOCS-1, in turn, influences both the IFN- γ and
IL-4 pathways. On the one hand, SOCS-1 is a negative reg-ulator of IFN- γ signaling, blocking the interaction of IFN-
γR and STAT-1 [35] due to direct inhibition of JAK1
[29,36]. On the other hand, SOCS-1 blocks the IL-4R/STAT-6 pathway [37]. SOCS-1 is, therefore, a key elementfor the inhibition from the IFN- γ to the IL-4 pathway. Th1cells express high levels of SOCS-1 mRNA, while it is
barely detectable in Th0 and Th2 cells [38]. Finally,another key molecule is T-bet, which is a transcription fac-
tor detected in Th1 but not Th0 or Th2 cells. T-bet expres-
sion is upregulated by IFN- γ in a STAT-1-dependent
mechanism [39]. Importantly, T-bet is an inhibitor ofGATA-3 [40], an activator of IFN- γ [40] and activator of T-
bet itself [41,42].
Th2 cells express IL-4, which is the major known determi-
nant of the Th2 phenotype itself [43]. IL-4 binds to itsreceptor, IL-4R, which is preferentially expressed in Th2cells [23,44]. The IL-4R signaling is transduced by STAT-6,which in turn activates GATA-3 [10]. GATA-3, in turn, iscapable of inducing IL-4 [45], thus establishing a feedbackloop. The influence from the IL-4 pathway on the IFN- γ
pathway seems to be mediated by GATA-3 via STAT-4
[46]. Like T-bet, GATA-3 also presents a self-activationloop [47-49].
IL-12 and IL-18 are two molecules that affect the IFN- γ
pathway. IL-12 is a cytokine produced by monocytes and
dendritic cells and promotes the development of Th1 cells
[50]. The IL-12 receptor is present in its functional form inTh0 and Th1 but not Th2 cells [51]. IL-12R signaling ismediated by STAT-4 [52], which is able to activate IFN- γTable 7: Circuits of the Th network a

[41,46,53]. The IL-12 signaling pathway can be blocked
by IL-4 by the STAT-6 dependent down-regulation of one
subunit of IL-12R [54]. IL-18 is a cytokine produced bymany cell types and promotes IFN- γ production in Th
cells [55]. It acts upon binding to its receptor, IL-18R,which acts through IRAK [56]. IL-12 and IL-18 act syner-gistically to increase IFN- γ production, but using different
pathways [57,58]. Finally, IL-4 is able to block IL-18 sign-
aling in a STAT-6 dependent manner [59].
IL-10 is a cytokine actively produced by Th2 cells, and it
inhibits cytokine production by Th1 cells. As with theother cytokines mentioned above, IL-10 acts upon bind-
ing to a cell surface receptor, IL-10R, which in turn acti-
vates the STAT signaling system [60]. In particular, it hasbeen shown that the functioning of IL-10 signaling isdependent upon the presence of STAT-3 [61]. As for thesignals affecting IL-10 expression, it has been shown thatIL-4 enhances IL-10 gene expression in Th2 but not Th1cells [62]. This requirement implies that the intracellular
signaling from IL-4 to IL-10 should pass through a Th2
specific molecule, which from the molecules consideredhere can only be GATA-3. Finally, IL-10 has been shownto be a very powerful inhibitor of IFN- γ production
[60,63].
Cytokine gene expression in T cells is induced by the acti-
vation of the T cell receptor (TCR) by ligand binding. Dif-ferent signaling pathways are activated by the TCR [64].Among these is the pathway including the NFAT family oftranscription factors, which are implicated in the T cell
activation-dependent regulation of numerous cytokines.
A constitutively active form of one of the NFAT proteins,
specifically NFATc1, increases the expression of IFN- γ
[65]. Importantly, the same experimental procedure doesnot affect the expression of IL-4. All this indicates that theNFAT family members play a central role in the TCR-

induced expression of cytokines during Th cell differenti-
ation, especially in the Th1 pathway.
The discrete dynamical system
The discrete system represents the network as a series of
interconnected elements that have only two possiblestates of activation, 0 (or inactive) and 1 (or active). Given
this property, the network is completely described by the
following set of Boolean equations:
Equation 1.
A node x in the network can have only one of three possi-
ble forms depending on whether it has activator and
inhibitor input nodes, or only activators, or only inhibi-
tors. In the first case, i.e. form § in Eqn.1, the Booleanfunction can be read as: x will be active in the next time
step if at this time any of its activators and none of its
inhibitors are acting upon it. Similarly, form §§ can be
translated as: x will be active if any of its activators is acting
upon it. And finally, form §§§ reads as: x will be active if
none of its inhibitors are acting upon it. Note than in allcases inhibitors are strong enough to change the state of anode from 1 to 0, while activators are strong enough to
change the state of a node from 0 to 1 if no inhibitor is act-
ing on the node of reference. The three alternative formsof representing a node in Equation 1 imply two possibledefault states of activation, i.e. the state of a node when
there are neither activators nor inhibitors acting upon it.If the connectivity of the node includes either only posi-
tive inputs, or both positive and negative inputs, then the
node has an inactive state by default. Alternatively, if theconnectivity of a node has only negative inputs, then thenode has an active state by default.
The Th network (Figure 2) can be converted into a discrete
dynamical system using Equation 1. The resulting system
of equations is as follows:

inputs. These four elements are thus treated as constants,since there are no interactions that regulate their behavior.Throughout the text, these four elements are considered as
having a value of 0.
Stable steady states of the discrete system
The discrete dynamical system defined by Equation 2 can
be solved in different ways to find its attractors, depend-ing on how to update the vector state X(t) to its successor,
X(t+1). By far the easiest method for solving the equations
is the synchronous approach (as in [66,67]). This method,
however, can generate spurious results (see [14]). Hence,we use generalized logical analysis to find all the steadystates of the system [15]. Generalized logical analysisallows us to find all the steady states of a discrete dynam-ical system by evaluating the functionality of the feedback
loops, also known as circuits, in the system. In this case,
the Th network (Figure 2) contains a total of 27 circuits(Table 7), 24 positive and 3 negative. Depending on theset of parameters used, positive feedback loops can gener-ate multistationarity, while negative feedback loops can
generate damped or sustained oscillations. Generalized
logical analysis is a well-established method and thereader may find in-depth explanations elsewhere[14,15,18].
The continuous dynamical system
To describe the network as a continuous dynamical sys-tem, we use the following set of ordinary differentialequations:
Equation 3.
The right-hand side of the differential equation comprises
two parts: an activation function and a term for decay.
Activation is a sigmoid function of
ω, which represents the
total input to the node. The equation of the sigmoid waschosen so as to pass through the two points (0,0) and(1,1), regardless of the value of its gain, h; see Figure 8. The
bounding of a node x to the closed interval [0,1] implies
that its level of activation should be interpreted as a nor-
malized , not an absolute, value. This characteristic permits
direct comparison between the discrete and the continu-ous dynamical systems, since in both formalisms the min-imum and maximum levels of activation are 0 and 1.Subsequently, the second part of the equation is a decay
term, which for simplicity is directly proportional to the
level of activation of the node.
The total input to a node, represented by
ω, is a combina-
tion of the multiple activatory and inhibitory interactionsacting upon the node of reference. In the general case, dif-ferent nodes have different connectivities; hence it is nec-
essary to write a function
ω so that it can describe different
combinations of activatory and inhibitory inputs. For thisEquation 3.

reason, ω has three possible forms in Equation 3. If a node
xi is regulated by both activators and inhibitors, then the
first form, §, is used. However, if is regulated exclusively
by activators, form §§ is used instead. Finally, the form
§§§ is used if xi has only negative regulators. In all cases,
the total input is a combination of weighted activatorsand/or inhibitors, where the weights are represented bythe
α and β parameters for the activators and inhibitors,
respectively. The mathematical form ω was chosen so as to
be monotonic and to be bounded in the closed interval[0,1] given that 0 ≤x≤1,
α>0 and β>0. Figure 9 shows the
behavior of ω when a node is controlled only by one acti-
vator. Notice that regardless of the value of α, the function
is monotonically increasing and bounded to [0,1]. The
reason for choosing a monotonic bounded function for ω
is to preserve the sigmoid form of the total activation act-
ing upon a node xi, irrespective of the number and nature
of the regulatory inputs acting upon it. Indeed, Figure 10shows the total activation of a node x
i controlled by one
positive regulation with different weights. Notice that thetotal activation retains a bounded sigmoid form inde-
pendently of the value of
α. This same qualitative behav-
ior for total activation on a node xi is observed if it is
regulated only by inhibitors. Figure 11 shows ω as a func-
tion of one inhibitor, plotted for different strengths ofinteraction. In this case, the total input to x
i is still a
bounded sigmoid regardless of the value of the parameter
β (see Figure 12). This general qualitative behavior per-
sists even with a mixture of activatory and inhibitoryinputs acting upon a node. Figure 13 presents the totalactivation of a node x
i as a function of two regulatoryinputs, one positive and one negative. Notice again that
the equation warrants a bounded sigmoid form for the
total input to a node.
Once a network is translated to a dynamical system using
Equation 3, it is necessary to specify values for all param-eters. For a system with n nodes and m interactions, there
are m+2n parameters. However, there are usually insuffi-
cient experimental data to assign realistic values for eachand every one of the parameters. Nevertheless, it is possi-ble to use a series of default values for all the parametersin Equation 3. The reason is that, as we showed in the pre-vious paragraph, the equations have the same qualitative
shape for any value assigned to the parameters. Hence, for
the sake of simplicity, it is possible to assign the same val-ues to most of the parameters, as a first approach. For thepresent study on the Th model, we use a value of 1 for allαs, βs and γs; and we use h = 10, since we currently lack
quantitative data to estimate more realistic values. More-over, the use of default values ensures the possibility of
creating the dynamical system in a fully automated way.
Nonetheless, after the initial construction and analysis ofthe resulting system, the modeler may modify the valuesof the parameters so as to fine-tune the dynamical behav-ior of the equations, whenever more experimental quanti-tative data become available. The continuous dynamical
system of the Th model, constructed with the use of Equa-
tion 3, yields a system of 23 equations, which is includedin the file "Th_continuous_model.octave.txt".
Stable steady states of the continuous system
Nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations are
studied numerically. Hence the continuous dynamical
system defined by Equation 3 poses the problem of howto find all its stable steady states without using very time-consuming and computing-intensive methods. This iswhere the creation of two dynamical systems of the samenetwork, one discrete and one continuous, bears fruit.
Since a Boolean (step) function is a limiting case of a very
steep sigmoid curve, networks made of binary elementsshare many qualitative features with systems modeledusing continuous functions [68]. Indeed, it has beenshown [19] that the qualitative information resulted fromgeneralized logical analysis can be directly used to find thenumber, nature and approximate location of the steady
states of a system of differential equations representing
the same network. We therefore decided to use this char-acteristic to speed up the process of finding all the stablesteady states in the continuous dynamical system. Specif-ically, the stable steady states of the discrete system areused as initial states to solve the differential equations,
running them until the system converges to its own stable
steady states. Calculating the convergence of a system ofordinary differential equations from a given initial state isa straightforward procedure using any numerical solver.Activation of a node as a fun ction two inputs, one positive and one negativeFigure 13

Abstract
While the use of computer tools to simulate complex processes such as computer circuits is
normal practice in fields like engineering, the majority of life sciences/biological sciencescourses continue to rely on the traditional textbook and memorization approach. To addressthis issue, we explored the use of the Cell Collective platform as a novel, interactive, andevolving pedagogical tool to foster student engagement, creativity, and higher-level think-
ing. Cell Collective is a Web-based platform used to create and simulate dynamical models
of various biological processes. Students can create models of cells, diseases, or pathwaysthemselves or explore existing models. This technology was implemented in both under-graduate and graduate courses as a pilot study to determine the feasibility of such softwareat the university level. First, a new (In Silico Biology) class was developed to enable stu-dents to learn biology by “building and breaking it ”via computer models and their simula-
tions. This class and technology also provide a non-intimidating way to incorporatemathematical and computational concepts into a class with students who have a limitedmathematical background. Second, we used the technology to mediate the use of simula-tions and modeling modules as a learning tool for traditional biological concepts, such asT cell differentiation or cell cycle regulation, in existing biology courses. Results of this pilotapplication suggest that there is promise in the use of computational modeling and softwaretools such as Cell Collective to provide new teaching methods in biology and contribute tothe implementation of the “Vision and Change ”call to action in undergraduate biology edu-
cation by providing a hands-on approach to biology.
Introduction
The enormous complexity that recent research has revealed in biological and biochemical sys-
tems has resulted in the emergence of mathematical modeling and computer simulations as anintegral part of biomedical research. This provides researchers with new tools to understand
the role of emergent properties in healthy and diseased cells, to generate new hypotheses, and
even screen potential pharmaceuticals for cross-reactivity and potential targets [ 1–3].

Given the fact that the field is undergoing a shift in the basic way the functions of these dy-
namical systems/networks are understood, it is essential for biology education to evolve in
order to reflect these changes [ 4,5]. It is vital for students to learn about these structures and
the resultant emergent properties that are not obvious from looking at static pictures in text-books. Furthermore, the National Science Foundation and the American Association for the
Advancement of Science have initiated a call to action, “Vision and Change ”[6], that aims to
transform undergraduate biology education by incorporating computational methods and byintroducing key core competencies including simulation and modeling. A number of efforts
have already been initiated in this direction, including problem-based learning in the under-
graduate setting [ 7], translational approaches (i.e., having students serve as researchers in the
classrooms to investigate biological problems and identify solutions), as well as those led by
Carl Wieman of the Carl Wieman Institute [ 8] and other leaders in foundational learning (e.g.,
[9,10]).
Our group has also attempted to address this issue using our recently developed and re-
leased modeling platform called Cell Collective [ 11,12]. The platform enables scientists to cre-
ate, simulate, and analyze large-scale computational models of various biological systemswithout the need to enter/modify any mathematical expressions and/or computer code. Be-cause accessibility to modeling for a wide audience is the key ingredient of the technology, the
platform lends itself to application in a classroom setting. Specifically, students can create, sim-
ulate, and analyze then break and re-create and re-analyze dynamical models to understandmajor biological processes. The collaborative nature of the Web-based environment enables
students to easily collaborate inside and outside of the classroom in a meaningful way. The
types of biological processes that can be explored with Cell Collective are virtually unlimited;students can model biological processes including, but not limited to, cellular development, cel-
lular differentiation, cell-to-cell interactions, disease pathogenesis, the effects of various treat-
ments on disease, etc.
Herein, we discuss two different applications of the Cell Collective ’s interactive technology
as a tool to facilitate hands-on, creative learning in the classroom and allow students to apply
their knowledge in real-time. The first is using Cell Collective in a dedicated course (In Silico
Biology) designed around the use of the technology, and the second involves introducing thetechnology as a supplement to existing, traditional biology courses. Both applications have
been subjected to initial testing in a variety of undergraduate settings, and the results indicate
that both methods were successful in increasing both understanding of and enthusiasm forcomplex biological systems in undergraduate student populations.
A New Course Designed for Integrated Learning of Biological and
Computational Concepts
In Silico Biology is a course that was designed de novo to use Cell Collective as the central tool
for teaching students complex biochemical systems by recreating them in silico. The individualobjectives of the course include helping students to expand their analytical skills and becomeinterested in computational sciences, learn to actively read primary journal articles, critically
analyze and interpret data, and use interactive computational models to learn about biological
networks. This is facilitated throughout the course via three major topics and strategies incor-porated into the course:
1. Introduction of biological concepts from a systems perspective
The focus of the biological component of the In Silico Biology course is on complex networksfound in biological systems. A series of lectures at the beginning of the semester provide

students with the foundation of molecular biology of the cell, including the principles of intra-
and intercellular signal transduction. During this session, students also learn to think about
biochemical protein regulatory mechanisms from a holistic perspective; that is, rather than fo-cusing on individual protein –protein interactions, students are expected to research and under-
stand the overall regulatory mechanism of a given protein while taking into account most
known interaction partners.
For example, students are required to go beyond the traditional representation of the regula-
tion of the Raf protein ( Fig. 1 ). Raf is a key component of the mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway, which regulates numerous cellular functions (e.g., growth, apoptosis, etc.).
Students learn that Ras is only one of many components required to successfully activate, aswell as deactivate, Raf via a combination of biochemical events ( Fig. 1B )[13,14]. In the final
part of this session, students are expected to research (from published literature) and describe
the complete regulatory mechanism of an enzyme of their choice, as a system of multiple inter-action components. In this session, students are also introduced to Cell Collective, and are ex-
pected to create and simulate a simple pathway model such as the one illustrated in Fig. 1A ,a s
well as to model the regulatory dynamics of the researched enzyme. Importantly, with this ap-proach, the students learn how to read and critically analyze primary journal articles.

2. Introduction to the dynamics of biological systems via computational
modeling
In this part of the course, students learn the principles of the technology and modeling frame-
work on which Cell Collective is based (Section 1 in S1 Text )[15–20]. This includes the differ-
ent types of representation of Boolean functions, as well as concepts of state transition graphs,
feedback loops, attractors, attractor stability, etc. All of these concepts are tied to and demon-strated in the Cell Collective platform and applied to biological examples. Students also learn
about nonlinear dynamics such as bistability and oscillations associated with positive and nega-
tive feedback loops, respectively. By the end of this session, students are able to represent com-plex biological regulatory mechanisms as Boolean functions and create and simulate the
dynamics of their corresponding models (by hand, as well as in Cell Collective). An example of
a biological system well-suited to the approach is bacterial chemotaxis (Section 2 in S1 Text ).
3. Blurring the line between education and research: incorporating
meaningful undergraduate research experiences into the classroom
A large part of the course is devoted to a hands-on project during which students learn about a
biological system by integrating the biological and computational concepts they learned in thecourse. Specifically, students select a biological network process of interest that they research,
construct a computational model representation of, and study the dynamics of the process by
simulating the model in Cell Collective.
From our experience, it is the learning-by-building approach that enables students to learn
and appreciate the diversity and complexities of biological systems. This method fosters curios-
ity from the students, which keeps them motivated and active in the project. Reading the litera-
ture with an objective to create a functional computer model forces the student to truly parseand analyze the information contained in published papers in order to distill the underlying
logic of the system. Section 3 in S1 Text provides an example of how students learn by reading
the literature and performing virtual research.

Incorporating Computational Modeling in Existing Life Sciences
Courses
As it is not always possible or practical to create a complete course de novo, the Cell Collective
platform has also been used to aid in various existing undergraduate and graduate courses.These include undergraduate/graduate (online) cancer biology, undergraduate microbiology,
and graduate (online) immunology courses.
In order to facilitate the introduction of modeling into existing courses, a series of modeling
modules were created; these modules are currently available in a new problem-based workbook
[21] focused on cancer biology. Students utilized the models that comprise the various modules
to simulate and analyze the dynamics of the biological processes as a way to visualize and rein-force the content discussed during regular lectures. The interactive nature of the technology en-
ables students to alter any component or pathway of the process and, via instant feedback,
observe the effects of the change made to the system.
The modules are complementary to the traditional method of teaching as an interactive, dy-
namic process with learning objectives that match the covered topic. For example, from the ex-
ercises used in the cancer biology course, learning objectives focused on 1) determining the

dynamic, complex signaling processes that regulate tumor development and tumor regression
and 2) the ability to illustrate feedback loops that contribute to tumor progression and regres-
sion after use of the Cell Collective. Learning objectives of the computational module used inthe microbiology course centered on the life cycle of Plasmodium spp., which leads to the de-
velopment of malaria. Specifically, after dynamically modeling and manipulating developmen-
tal processes of the Plasmodium lifecycle, students should be able to 1) draw and describe the
complex life cycle and 2) define “vector, ”“reservoir, ”and“transmission. ”
Table 1 provides a list of modeling modules developed so far. As an example, one of these
modeling modules used for more effective learning is discussed next.
T cell differentiation and response to pathogen
T cell differentiation is an important concept taught in many immunology courses. Precise reg-
ulation of the differentiation process of naive CD4+ T cells (a subset of T-lymphocytes) to oneof the helper T cells or regulatory T cells (Tregs) is critical for the proper functioning of the im-
mune system. At the intracellular level, the differentiation process is regulated via a wide varie-
ty of types of signaling receptors and pathways that are mutually cross-linked and form highlyinterconnected biochemical networks. Additionally, cytokines produced by each cell further
modulate the activation and behavior of neighboring cells, as well as the entire immune system
[22,23]. Hence, the complex network structures and nonlinear dynamics governing this pro-
cess, via both intra- and intercellular paths, make T cell differentiation a great candidate for an
interactive modeling approach. As such, a modeling module that mimics concepts and rela-
tionships ( Fig. 2 ) was created and used to aid the learning of T cell differentiation in Cell
Collective.
An advantage to the availability of a tool such as Cell Collective is that students can alter ex-
ternal and internal conditions of the cell and observe real-time “output ”or consequences at the
molecular and/or cellular level. For example, students are asked to simulate the model by firstactivating antigen presenting cells (APCs) and naive T cells by introducing a “pathogen. ”Path-
ogens can be introduced by changing a simple activity slider on the user interface ( Fig. 3A ). As
illustrated in Fig. 3B (left), the dynamical response to the change of the environment is imme-
diate. Students can subsequently simulate Th2 differentiation by introducing IL4 ( Fig. 3B mid-
dle), as well as the effects of regulatory T cells (Treg) by activating TGF beta ( Fig. 3B right). In
addition to the time-series, real-time simulation output, students can view the dynamics of theentire model in a network representation in which each component of the model interactively
assumes different colors based on the activity level of the component ( Fig. 3C ).
Students are assigned a number of similar exercises to better understand the dynamics gov-
erning T cell regulation during the activation of the immune system, including positive feed-back loops and associated bistable behaviors. Note that this model is one of many possible
computational model representations of T cell differentiation. Other logical models that in-
clude greater detail as to specific molecular interactions have been previously published by oth-ers [24–26], and some of these are also available in Cell Collective for simulations.
Outcomes and Discussion
A number of efforts to incorporate computation into life science courses have been established.
For example, BioQuest consortium ( http://www.bioquest.org ) provides access to software
tools, datasets, and other materials developed by educators and developers engaged in educa-tion and research in science. Another example includes NetLogo, a programming environment
for agent-based modeling that has been used to study dynamics of complex systems, as well as
for teaching of complex systems in many settings (middle schools, high schools, and
PLOS Computational Biology | DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004131 March 19, 2015 5 / 9
universities) [ 27]. Our approach provides a novel take on the implementation of problem-
based methods in life sciences in that it offers a Web-based, systems- and network-focused,
interactive, and real-time simulation-driven environment without the need for computer pro-gramming or manipulation of complex mathematical equations.
We have used a Cell Collective “learning by modeling ”approach both as a stand-alone class
and as a supplement to complement existing classes. In both cases, student outcomes werehighly positive (Section 5 in S1 Text ). Future studies will include a comprehensive study using
both quasi-experimental and randomized control groups to determine the effect that use of
Cell Collective has on student understanding, long-term retention, critical thinking, applica-
tion, and overall mastery of material.
In addition to directly addressing the challenging problem of teaching students about com-
plex, highly connected networks, there is an additional benefit; it provides these students with
an opportunity to become interested in additional training in computational methods, some-thing that is critical for the current and the next generation of biomedical researchers. Making
the class accessible for students with a wide range of skills such as biology, computer science,
mathematics, etc., creates an ample environment for learning from one another, resulting incross-pollination across disciplines.

Furthermore, one of the major components of utilization of Cell Collective was blurring the
line between learning and research. This is a non-trivial aspect of this teaching method and, in-
deed, it is in some ways the most exciting —for both the students and potentially the instruc-
tors. In the course of their learning, students have the opportunity to be constructing the veryfirst model of the system they are studying or, if working on an existing model, they have the
opportunity to add information from recent literature to significantly update an existing
model. This means that students, while learning, are engaging in real research. In our applica-tion of this teaching method, we have had a number of student-created and/or student-
initiated modeling projects that led to research findings, some of which were subsequently
presented by the students at an external research conference [ 28], and even accepted for publi-
cation in a peer-reviewed journal [ 29].
A positive consequence of this is that it is possible for faculty to further their own research
during the course of teaching the material. We have had several experiences of students whohad no knowledge of what they might be interested in studying being assigned a project in theclass that aligned with a research interest of our group. In several cases, the results were ulti-
mately useful to the group, and in subsequent semesters new students were assigned to either
re-create, significantly update, or provide fresh analysis of the model.
All students that made significant contributions to the models were included as authors on
all publications using that information. This result is a true win-win situation; faculty responsi-
ble for teaching a course have the possibility of actually furthering their research, while stu-dents have the possibility to perform and be recognized for research participation. Real

Background
Longitudinal time course data are the basis for modelling
signalling networks in a holistic systems biology approach
in order to uncover mechanisms of signal transductiondynamics [1,2]. Network models provide novel insight
[3,4] and allow us to perform efficiently simulations to
predict systems behaviour or evaluate certain hypotheses[5]. Furthermore, combining perturbation experiments
with the measurements of system dynamics seems to
be even more efficient than time series data on theirown [6-8]. Knock-outs or stimuli as directed perturba-
tions support the systematic identification of regulatory
relationships.
Quantitative models, based on differential equations,
require explicit knowledge on the kinetics of the sys-tem of interest [9-12]. In contrast, the qualitative Boolean
abstraction considers the components’ states as binary
variables, being either active (1) or passive (0), but nev-ertheless encompasses the essential functionality [13,14].
Wang et al. stressed, that Boolean models have already
been successfully applied in reverse engineering of pro-teomic signalling networks, and their reduced complexity
is considered to be especially advantageous for large-
scale systems [15]. To avoid the drawbacks of purely data-
or literature-driven algorithms regarding completeness,
generalisation or interpretability, combined approaches
become more and more prominent in the area of net-work reconstruction [6,16,17]. Some reverse engineering
approaches, like ddepn [6] or CellNOptR [18], ideally join
perturbed time course input data and literature prior
knowledge in network reconstruction, while preserving
the simplicity of Boolean logic at the same time. Forwardengineering methods allow subsequent analysis of the sta-
ble states of the reconstructed system. Hence, this may
allow to deduce possible long-term behaviour of compo-nents activity under perturbations. Such approaches are
integrated and freely available in the open source Python
software package BooleanNet [19] or in the R[20] pack-
ageBoolNet [21], for example. As reviewed by Samaga
and Klampt [22], several software tools can be applied for
the dynamic modeling of logical signal transduction net-works. Among others, they exemplarily mentioned GIN-
sim[23], SQUAD [24], BooleanNet [19], ChemChains [25],
Odefy [26], and BoolNet [21].
Here we focus on protein signalling networks in breast
cancer, representing the most common cancer type
among women [27]. Breast cancer, as a heterogeneous
disease, can be divided into subgroups, which differ in
cellular properties as well as in prognosis. This requiresindividual therapy approaches, which are in the focus of
current research and have partially already been realised.
Here we are interested in the ‘HER2-positive’ subtype
of breast cancer, overexpressing the human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also termed ErbB-2).ErbB-2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and mem-
ber of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family,
consisting of three further RTKs, namely ErbB-1, ErbB-3
and ErbB-4. These receptors cooperatively function ashomo- or heterodimers after activation via growth fac-
tors like EGF for ErbB-1 or heregulin (HRG) for ErbB-3
[28]. This initialises signalling cascades, pathologicallycontributing to tumourigenesis and tumour progression.
Interestingly, different dimer formations induce different
signalling pathways, like PI3K and MAPK, also with dif-fering signalling strengths [29]. The role of the orphan
receptor ErbB-2 in dysregulation of the ErbB network
is of major interest, due to its overexpression in 10-20% of breast tumours, diagnosed as HER2-positive.
Furthermore, its role as favoured dimerisation part-
ner independent on ligand-activation implies oncogenicpotential [30-32]. The therapeutic antibodies trastuzumab
and pertuzumab have especially been designed to target
ErbB-2 [33].
However, frequently occurring therapy resistance
reduces the efficiency of targeted therapeutics [34-36].This resistance is often associated with deregulated path-
way activity [37,38] or bypasses via other RTKs, especially
ErbB family members [39]. Mainly ErbB-1 expression hasbeen anticipated as molecular cause to overcome impact
of ErbB-2 targeting drugs. Small-molecule inhibitors such
as erlotinib are already in use against non-small cell lungcancer [40] and pancreatic cancer [41].
Here we aim as a first step at the identification of
individual drug response patterns and insights into drugresistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. ErbB-2 ampli-
fied cell lines were therefore subjected to short- and
long-term drug treatment with erlotinib, pertuzumab andtrastuzumab, alone or in combinations. Samples were
analysed by reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) [42].
We were interested in synergistic benefits of combining
erlotinib, pertuzumab or trastuzumab in ErbB-1 express-
ing, ErbB-2 amplified tumours with differing resistancephenotypes. Therefore three representative breast cancer
cell lines were selected as model systems, namely BT474,
SKBR3 and HCC1954, of which the latter is known to betrastuzumab resistant due to a PIK3CA mutation, while
BT474 exhibits wild type behaviour [43]. The SKBR3 cell
line is supposed to be pertuzumab resistant [44].
ErbB dimers predominantly activate the MAPK and
PI3K pathway [29]. Therefore, we concentrated on the
involved key regulators in fast downstream signalling.Among those were ERK1/2 and AKT, and also p70S6K,
which is upstream influenced by both of the signalling
axes. Phosphorylation of RPS6 and RB was used as long-
term indicator for proliferation, cell cycle or tumour
progression [28]. Prior literature knowledge on ErbB sig-nalling was used as input for protein network reconstruc-
tion per cell line via ddepn . Beyond that, we inferred
von der Heyde et al. BMC Systems Biology 2014, 8:75 
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/8/75
combined therapies that target ErbB family members, cus-
tomised to the topology of the different subtypes. BoolNet
was applied to compute stable cycles of protein activ-
ity states, so-called attractors, incorporating all possibletreatment combinations. This way, optimal drug treat-
ment to deactivate oncogenic proteins was identified.
Methods
Data
Protein abundance and phosphorylation measurements inBT474, SKBR3 and HCC1954 cells were carried out as
described by Henjes et al. [28]. In principle, the RPPA pro-tein array technology works as follows. Minimal amounts
(1 nl volume) of cell lysate are spotted along with a serial
dilution of control samples on nitrocellulose-coated glassslides using a printing robot (Aushon 2470 arrayer). Sam-
ples are organised as ordered subarrays so that they are
addressable during the data analysis procedure, and a sin-gle slide can accommodate one or more subarrays. Each
subarray is analysed using a highly specific detection anti-
body to measure the abundance of a certain protein or itsphosphorylation rate. For each spot, the ratio of bound
d e t e c t i o na n t i b o d yi sv i s u a l i s e du s i n gs e c o n d a r ya n t i b o d -
ies labelled with near infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes.Slides are scanned using the Odyssey scanner (LiCor Bio-
sciences). Spot intensities are determined using a microar-
ray image analysis software (GenePix).
Apart from the quantitative character, another advan-
tage of the technology is the handling of large sample setswhich protein abundance can be detected simultaneously
in a high throughput fashion. 20-200 identical slides can
be produced in parallel in a single print run.
In order to normalise the data spot-wise for deviant total
protein concentrations due to spotting variance, staining
with Fast Green FCF dye was employed [42]. There-fore, one slide was stained with the dye to determine the
total protein content of each lysate spot and correspond-
ing signal intensity correction factors. The spots on theremaining slides were divided by these correction factors
and afterwards multiplied by the median value to scale the
data back to the native range.
The RPPA data used here include data presented in
Henjes et al. [28]. Additionally, further targets have been
measured and were used for network reconstruction. The
complete data set has been submitted to the Gene Expres-
sion Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE50109.
Short-term measurements
In the short-term measurements, trastuzumab, per-tuzumab and erlotinib were added to the cells in starva-
tion medium one hour before stimulation with the growth
factors EGF and HRG. All possible 24 combinations ofdrugs and stimuli were measured. Application of the stim-
uli was defined as time point zero in the measurements.The growth factors were chosen to activate explicitly the
MAPK and PI3K pathway. Lysate preparation was per-
formed at ten time points, namely after 0, 4, 8, 12, 16,
20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes. The drug treatment exper-iments comprised three biological replicates, whereas the
inhibitor-free experiments incorporated five biological
replicates. The experiments for the SKBR3 cell line com-prised only two biological replicates of HRG stimulated
cells under the triple drug combination. Each biological
replicate was spotted in triplicate on the RPPA slides.To obtain short-term signal intensities, eleven antibodies
for specific phosphorylation sites were selected according
to quality checks, including inspection of correspondingdilution series and comparison to signals arising from sec-
ondary antibodies only. The chosen target proteins and
respective antibodies are listed in Additional file 1.
Long-term measurements
For long-term measurements, no explicit ligand stimu-
lation was performed. Instead, cells were incubated in
full growth medium for 24 hours prior to adding thethree mentioned therapeutics in double combinations or
as triplet. Single drug treatment was just conducted with
erlotinib. Full growth medium was used to avoid con-founding effects of nutrient deficiency. Protein abundance
was also quantified without any drug application. The
measuring points included 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24 and 30hours with three biological and technical replicates each.
At time point 18, only two biological replicates were avail-
able. Additional file 1 displays the 21 targets of interest for
long-term signalling.
Statistical inference of drug effects
To determine, whether a specific drug treatment revealed
an inhibiting effect on the signal intensities of the proteins,we applied the following method. Firstly, for each protein
and (combinatorial) drug treatment we linearly modelled
the signal intensities as depending on the factors time and
group , i.e. no drug treatment versus drug treatment. If the
interaction of both factors showed a significant (p-value <
0.05) influence on the signal intensity, we further applieda Wilcoxon rank sum test for the measurements at time
point 60 minutes for the short-term data, or at time point
30 hours for the long-term data. Thereby, we tested for
significantly (p-value <0.05) smaller intensity values in
the drug treated group. The drug treatments with a sig-nificant test result were considered as efficient inhibitors.
The therapeutic (combination) with the smallest p-value
was defined as the optimal one.
Literature prior knowledge
We manually determined two reference networks, i.e. onefor each time course, as initial joint hypotheses for all
of the three breast cancer cell lines. Because emphasis
von der Heyde et al. BMC Systems Biology 2014, 8:75 
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/8/75
was put on phosphoproteomic signalling, this was mainly
based on PhosphoSitePlus®[45]. Several publications con-
firm these assumptions, as depicted in Additional file 2.
Network reconstruction
For Boolean network reconstruction, we chose the
method of dynamic deterministic effects propagation net-works (DDEPN) [6]. This method was particularly tailored
to perturbed longitudinal protein phosphorylation data.
It is based on the DEPN approach [46], which stands fordeterministic effects propagation networks. The deter-
minism is related to the way of perturbation effect prop-
agation in the networks from parent to child nodes,
implying transitively closed graphs. The dynamic version
of Bender et al. [6,47] differs with respect to the integra-tion of perturbed time course measurements. While the
DEPN approach requires many perturbations, like knock-
downs, but only few time points, which are regarded asindependent measurements, ddepn is designed for longer
time series without the necessity of many or all network
nodes being perturbed. The latter situation, i.e. few per-turbations by drug interventions, reflected the design of
the RPPA experiments under consideration here, hence
leading to the application of ddepn . Most network recon-
struction algorithms have been designed for gene expres-
sion data from microarray measurements [7], which differ
from (phospho-)protein data regarding the amount ofinvolved network nodes. Many current methods are tai-
lored to the inference of gene regulatory networks based
on static measurements at one time point, reflecting the
steady state of the system under consideration [48]. The
longitudinal time course data used here require a suitablemethod, as provided by ddepn . The method of Bender
et al. was shown to outperform two dynamical Bayesian
network approaches, and to be capable of inferring knownsignalling cascades in the ErbB pathway [47]. A further
advantage was the public availability of ddepn as an R[20]
package.
The reconstruction procedure is depicted in Additional
file 3, and the core elements are described according
to [6,47] in the following. The protein interaction net-works are modelled as directed, possibly cyclic, graphs,
with nodes V={v
i:i∈1,...,N}representing proteins
and edges representing interactions. Also the external per-turbations, i.e. the drugs and growth factors in our case,
are modelled as nodes. The edge types can be either acti-
vating or inhibiting, denoted by 1 and -1, respectively,in the adjacency matrix /Phi1=V×V→{0, 1,−1}of
the network. An entry of zero indicates no edge between
two nodes. So each edge incorporates a pair of nodes/braceleftbig

the basis for the reconstruction, are stored in a matrixD={d

fitting to the data, we applied the stochastic Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach of ddepn , called
inhibMCMC , in which the space of possible networks
is sampled, based on posterior probabilities. It extends
a Metropolis-Hastings type of MCMC sampler by the

denotes the optimized system state matrix, containing

estimated in the following way. Assuming that the pro-teins can be either active (1) or inactive (0), signalling
dynamics are modelled by Boolean signal propagation
for a given network. All nodes, except the permanentlyactive perturbations, are therefore initialised with inactive
states. The transition rule is that children nodes get acti-
vated if at least one activating parent node is active andall inhibiting ones are inactive. In this way, all reachable
system states are computed and stored in a matrix /Gamma1=

edges with maximum confidence. We made use of the
Laplace prior model ( laplaceinhib ), accounting for both
edge types, i.e. activation and inhibition. The prior belief

sen prior are displayed in Additional file 2. The prior’s
impact strength was emphasised in such a way, that onlystrongly deviating data influence the network structure,
because the ErbB wiring as well as the MAPK and PI3K
pathways are well examined in literature. This prioritisa-tion is reflected in the hyperparameter λset to 0.0001. For
the parameter γwe chose one, neglecting extra penali-
sation of deviation from the prior. These settings shouldpreserve robustness, but at the same time allow enough
impact strength of strongly differing data values.
The network inference via inhibMCMC spanned 50,000
iterations with the first 25,000 iterative steps as burn-in
phase. To ensure convergence, ten parallel MCMC chainswere run, each initialised with a starting network. Con-
vergence was validated via Gelman diagnostic [49]. Nine
of the initial ten networks were randomly generated, i.e.for the defined nodes activating, inhibiting or no edges
were sampled. The remaining network assumed no con-
nections between the nodes. These initial networks werepruned to the following constraints. Firstly, the nodes
related to the growth factors and drugs must not have
any ingoing edges. Above that, the indegree of all nodeswas limited to four. Finally, no self-loops were allowed.
To find significantly occurring edges among the indepen-
dent runs, merging into a consensus network, a Wilcoxonrank sum testing procedure was used. In detail, in each
run the amount of sampled activations and inhibitions per
edge was counted and divided by the total number of sam-
pled edges. Subsequently the null-hypothesis was tested,
whether the means of these ten edge-specific confidencevalues equal the same for activation and inhibition. In case
of not rejecting the null-hypothesis, coming along with an
adjusted p-value exceeding the significance level α=0.05,
no edge was assumed. Otherwise, the respective alter-
native determined the type of interaction. Adjustment
for multiple testing followed the method of Benjaminiand Hochberg, controlling the false discovery rate [50].
The whole procedure was embedded into a leave-one-
out cross-validation approach. So each of the ten MCMCchains was left out once, and the testing algorithm was
applied to the remaining runs. An edge was included in
the final consensus network if it occurred in all of thecross validation runs. Finally, to prevent excessive spuri-
ous or obsolete connections ascribable to transitivity, as
argued by Bo Na Ki et al. [51], newly reconstructed edgeswere successively added to the prior network according to
ddepn significance and fit of resulting attractor states to
the observations of Henjes et al. [28].
Perturbation simulations
To figure out which input of drug combination leads to
a certain attractor state of the reconstructed networksystem, the Rpackage BoolNet [21] was applied. The moti-
vation was based on the assumption that attractors, rep-
resenting cycles of states, comprise the stable states of cellfunction. In those states networks mostly reside. Hence,
they mirror system phenotypes, dependent on the pertur-
bation context. To the best of our knowledge, apart from
BoolNet , there are hardly any Rpackages offering attractor
calculations for Boolean networks. This package supportsimport of networks in form of files containing Boolean
formulas. So it could be easily integrated in our workflow
as subsequent analysis step after network reconstruction.
We used its functionality to identify attractors in a syn-
chronous and an asynchronous way. The resulting attrac-
tors were steady-state attractors. These consist of onlyone state, in which all transitions from this state result.
These attractors are identical for synchronous and asyn-
chronous updates. We focused on the steady-states, asthese should reflect the homoeostatic system state of the
cell lines. Intermediate transition states would be interest-
ing as well, but due to the large amount of the involvedtargets, it would have been too complex to analyse those
here in detail.
The search started from predefined initial states of
the network nodes. The drug and growth factor nodes
were fixed to specific values, reflecting the conductedexperiment to be simulated. For short-term signalling,
perturbations included all possible combinations of the
therapeutics under the combined stimulus of EGF andHRG. Although the data of separate stimulation with EGF
and HRG was used for network reconstructions, here we
focused on the combined treatment, representing a morenatural tumour environment than a single growth factor
alone. Two possible binary states, i.e. active (1) or pas-
sive (0), to the power of three different drugs led to eightpossible combinations. These were used as fixed input
conditions, as the effect was assumed to be continuously
valid. Analogously, the growth factors were permanentlyfixed to one. The remaining protein activity start states
were initialised with zero. These components were flexi-
ble towards updates. In the long-term measurements, nogrowth factors were involved but full growth medium.
This was defined as one stimulating input S, initially acti-
vating the ErbB receptors. This also led to eight fixed input
combinations.
BoolNet expects network representation in form of log-
ical interaction rules as input. In contrast, ddepn deliv-
ers network reconstruction output in terms of adjacency

tion into the ddepn package, called adjacencyMa-
trix_to_logicalRules .I nd e t a i l ,t h e loadNetwork function
ofBoolNet requires a file containing row-wise logical acti-
vation rules of each network node. Each row looks like
‘target node, (activator_1 |activator_2) & !(inhibitor_1 |
inhibitor_2)’, here exemplary for a node with two ingo-ing activating and inhibiting edges each. The logical OR
operator is encoded by ‘ |’, the logical AND is encoded
by ‘&’, and logical negation is represented by ‘!’. Accord-ingly, all of the Ainferred activating nodes V
+=
{va:a∈1,...,A,A<N}of a target node vj,r e p r e s e n t e d
by an adjacency matrix entry φaj=1, and vjitself were
connected via OR operators. This ensured that at least one
of the activators or the target protein itself had to be active
to activate the target node. Analogously, the Iinhibiting
nodes V−={vi:i∈1,...,I,I<N}withφij=− 1w e r e
connected via OR operators. A logical negation opera-
tor was attached to ensure that the activity of one of the
nodes viwould result in an inactive node vj.B o t hs e t s
of activators and negated inhibitors were then connectedvia a logical AND operator. After conversion of the adja-
cency matrices to logical rules, those were implemented
inBoolNet into a computational model, to perform per-
turbation simulations per cell line and time course as well
as subsequent analyses of the resulting attractor states.
Results and discussion
The complete workflow, holding for both, short- and
long-term analysis, is depicted in Figure 1. For a better
understanding of the discussion on MAPK and PI3K sig-
nalling, Figure 2 displays the interactions between themain MAPK and PI3K targets of the ErbB prior net-
works. It shows the preferred pathway activations by all
possible homo- and heterodimers formed upon ligandbinding to the ErbB-1 and ErbB-3 receptors [9,29,52-54].
The confidence values, representing the likeliness of the
reconstructed network edges, are shown in Additionalfile 4.
Short-term signalling network reconstruction
The short-term signalling networks, reconstructed by the
ddepn algorithm, are depicted in Figure 3. The equivalent
Boolean logical interaction rules are listed in Additional
file 5. In comparison to the prior network, newly inferred
edges were specific for each cell line, and all of themwere activating. For HCC1954 and BT474, seven addi-
tional edges were reconstructed, while in SKBR3 only two
new edges were reconstructed. No prior edge deletion ortype reversal took place.
HCC1954 is driven by the PI3K as well as the MAPK pathway
In HCC1954, the new edges contributed to both, PI3K
and MAPK, signalling. The interaction ErbB-1 →ErbB-2reflected a dominant role of heterodimerisation of both
receptors, as described by Henjes et al. [28]. The fact
that it was specifically inferred for HCC1954, pointed
to hyperactive ErbB-1/2 heterodimers here. These areknown to trigger the MAPK but also, to a lesser extent,

pathway, and MEK1/2 in the MAPK pathway, respec-
tively. Two of the new edges in HCC1954, PDK1 →ErbB-2
and p70S6K →AKT, contributed to feedback loops, which
were not present in the other two cell lines. Such a
topological network element could stabilise the knowntrastuzumab resistance by boosting the oncogenic effect
of ErbB-2 and the mutant hyperactive PI3K pathway. Evi-
dence for the feedback mechanism involving PDK1 wasprovided by Maurer et al. [56] and Tseng et al. [57]. Vega
et al. noted an indirect activation of AKT by p70S6K via
mTOR [58].
BT474 is driven by the PI3K pathway, while SKBR3 is driven by
the MAPK pathway
Comparably to HCC1954, in BT474 an edge indicat-
ing hyperactive heterodimers was found, namely ErbB-3→ErbB-2, here interestingly with a strong impact on
AKT [28]. BT474 is known to contain a rare type
of PIK3CA mutation [43]. Pathway crosstalk was alsoobserved in BT474, but here MEK1/2 activated PDK1, and
not vice versa like in HCC1954. This edge was supported
by Frödin et al. [59], underlining dominant PI3K signallingin this cell line.
The newly detected interactions in SKBR3 started from
ErbB-3 and PDK1, and both activated ERK1/2. This
reflected a dominant MAPK pathway, in which ErbB-
3→ERK1/2 was interpretable as indirect stimulation of
ERK1/2 via MEK1/2, activated by ErbB-2/3 dimers [55].
Perturbation simulations on short-term networks
Perturbations included all possible combinations of
the therapeutics erlotinib, pertuzumab and trastuzumab
under combined stimulation of EGF and HRG. Allinferred attractors were simple and consisted of one
steady-state. This means that all transitions from this state
result in the state itself. Table 1 summarises all simula-
tion outcomes for the attractors of the AKT and ERK1/2
proteins, as those are key players in the PI3K (AKT) andMAPK (ERK1/2) pathways. Additionally, the results for
p70S6K are listed there, as both pathways regulate this
protein [60].
Stimulation with EGF and HRG should result in acti-
vation of ErbB-1 and ErbB-3, followed by dimerisation
amongst ErbB members. This should initialise signallingcascades in the MAPK and PI3K pathways (Figure 2).
Indeed, AKT, ERK1/2 and p70S6K got activated in

simulation results, corresponding to attractor states of
AKT, ERK1/2 and p70S6K being zero. Four main con-
clusions were drawn from these results, which will be
discussed in detail in the following subsections. Firstly,inhibition of PI3K signalling, reflected by downregulated
AKT, required the combined treatment with erlotinib,
pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Secondly, inhibition of theMAPK pathway, represented by ERK1/2, was reached
with erlotinib alone in SKBR3 and HCC1954. BT474 addi-
tionally needed pertuzumab. Thirdly, the protein activity
of p70S6K was influenced by both, PI3K and MAPK,
pathways. The drug response differed between cell lines,indicating both pathways contribute to a different extent.
Finally, the drug effect on PI3K signalling was much better
in SKBR3 than in HCC1954, pointing to resistance in thelatter cell line.
Inhibition of PI3K signalling requires drug combinations
In SKBR3, the triple drug combination was most effec-
tive in inhibiting AKT (Figure 4, Table 2). In BT474,pertuzumab combined with erlotinib was most effi-
cient, but AKT signalling was not fully suppressed as
in SKBR3 (Figure 5). Statistically, we did not infer any
significant positive drug effect in this cell line. Obvi-ously, erlotinib in synergistic combination with at least
pertuzumab was needed to block the ErbB-2 receptor
and its heterodimerisation, mainly with ErbB-1, but alsoErbB-3. The HRG activated ErbB-2/3 heterodimers and
PI3K pathway in BT474, as revealed by the network
reconstructions, might have prevented a potent drug
efficacy.
Interestingly, BT474 and SKBR3 required pertuzumab.
This drug was especially designed to prevent het-
erodimerisation with ErbB-2. The stimuli EGF and HRG
together activate PI3K signalling by ErbB-2/3, ErbB-1/2 and ErbB-1/3 dimers (Figure 2). The need for
pertuzumab combined with erlotinib indicated an impor-
tant role of ErbB-1/2 dimers. This was supported by thefact, that in HCC1954 with dominant heterodimers of
this type, as revealed by network reconstructions, none

of the drugs was likewise efficient in inhibiting AKT
(Figure 6). However, the optimal effect was revealed for
the triple drug combination (Table 2). The simulations
suggested pertuzumab alone or a combination of both
monoclonal antibodies (Table 1). It has to be kept in
mind, that the attractor states resembled a long-termsteady state, which can differ from observations up to 60
minutes.
The perturbation simulations in BT474 did not lead to
inactive AKT upon combined pertuzumab and erlotinib
treatment. Instead, erlotinib alone or combined with
trastuzumab was efficient (Table 1). Nevertheless, thissupported the need for the small molecule inhibitor
and a monoclonal antibody to suppress ErbB-2 induced
PI3K signalling. In SKBR3, the attractor states con-firmed the described optimal drug treatment to deactivate
AKT. Trastuzumab, when applied alone, was the only
treatment without a positive effect in the simulations(Table 1).Inhibition of MAPK signalling requires erlotinib
Signalling through the MAPK pathway, represented byERK1/2 activation, was efficiently inhibited by erlotinibalone in both, HCC1954 (Figure 6, Table 2) and SKBR3
(Figure 4, Table 2), cell lines. EGF activates the MAPK
pathway via ErbB-1 homodimers and ErbB-1/2 het-erodimers (Figure 2). Both are prevented by ErbB-1 inhibi-
tion via erlotinib, which was especially designed to target
this receptor.
In BT474, pertuzumab plus erlotinib was required
(Figure 5, Table 2). This was analogous to the situation in
PI3K signalling.
HRG activates the MAPK pathway via ErbB-2/3 het-
erodimers (Figure 2). Obviously, BT474 needed the
addition of the monoclonal antibody due to dominantErbB-2/3 formation and activity. On the contrary, the
other two cell lines just needed erlotinib alone. Here, in
addition to the ErbB-1 dimers, the ligand-independent
ErbB-2 homodimers might have driven ERK1/2 activation

and could be inhibited by the small molecule inhibitor.
Efficacy of erlotinib towards ErbB-2 dimers was previ-ously mentioned by Schaefer et al. [61].
In BT474, the simulations resulted in active ERK1/2
states, resisting drug treatment (Table 1). In HCC1954
and SKBR3, the positive effect of erlotinib was supported
by the simulations. The attractor states were additionallyinactive for all other (combinatorial) drug treatments, but
not trastuzumab alone.
p70S6K is influenced by both, PI3K and MAPK, pathways
The target p70S6K is upstream influenced by the PI3K
as well as the MAPK pathway (Figure 2). Hence, p70S6Kmerges both pathways, leading to activation of RPS6 [60].
The three cell lines showed different pathway prefer-
ences. BT474 required the combination of pertuzumaband erlotinib to suppress p70S6K (Figure 5). On the con-
trary, in SKBR3 the triple drug combination was shown to
be optimal (Table 2). Obviously, the effect was driven by
erlotinib (Figure 4), which was supported by the attractorstates of p70S6K (Table 1). This resembled the drug
response of ERK1/2 and reflected a stronger influence bythe MAPK pathway. In HCC1954, deactivation of p70S6K
was reached via application of erlotinib combined with
pertuzumab (Table 2). The treatment with erlotinib alone
had a similar effect (Figure 6), while the simulations just
confirmed a positive effect of pertuzumab (Table 1). Thus,this cell line seemed to be influenced by both, PI3K and
MAPK, pathways.
These results were in line with the newly inferred edges
in the network reconstructions. They pointed to a strong
influence of PI3K in BT474 in contrast to a dominant
MAPK pathway in SKBR3. HCC1954 was influenced byboth pathways to a similar extent.
To follow up on the hypothesis that different path-
ways contribute to a different extent in individual celllines, we tested correlation between the p70S6K time
course and the ones of AKT and ERK1/2, respectively.
In BT474, p70S6K correlated positively with AKT (p-
value 0.01, Kendall’s τestimate 0.64). In HCC1954,

(p-value 0.05, Kendall’s τestimate 0.51) and ERK1/2
(p-value 0.02, Kendall’s τestimate 0.6), with a strongertendency towards MAPK signalling. The correlation
was not as convincing as in the other two cell lines.One could speculate, that the dominance of the MAPK
pathway in SKBR3 cells was not as strong as the domi-
nance of the PI3K pathway in BT474. This was supportedby the reconstructed networks. They revealed down-

stream effects of MAPK signalling in SKBR3, while they
revealed hyperactive ErbB-2/3 dimers in BT474. The
dimers drive PI3K already at the receptor layer, and espe-
cially ErbB-2/3 dimers are regarded as the most potentheterodimer [29].
Drug resistance in HCC1954 regarding the PI3K pathway
In HCC1954, the inferred optimal treatment against AKT
signalling with the triple drug combination was not con-
vincing (Figure 6). Analogously, Henjes et al. did notmonitor any positive drug effect on AKT under EGF appli-
cation alone [28]. However, the simulations suggested
pertuzumab alone or a combination of both monoclonal
antibodies to inhibit AKT phosphorylation. In principle,
divergence of simulations from experimental observationscan be expected, as the simulated steady state of the sys-
tem does not necessarily have to be reached after the
measured period of time. Anyhow, the apparent resis-tance here pointed to a hyperactive PI3K pathway which
was explainable by the newly inferred HCC1954 edges
described in the previous subsection. They representedfeedback loops, hyperactive ErbB-1/2 heterodimers and
pathway crosstalk. On the contrary, in SKBR3, the triple
drug combination worked well, as described before. Thesimulations even predicted efficacy of every other drug
(combination) apart from trastuzumab alone. The drug
efficacy towards AKT in this cell line could be explainedby the fact that the two reconstructed interactions in
SKBR3 mainly promoted the MAPK instead of the PI3K
pathway.
The regulation of AKT activity under drug influence,
highly diverging in HCC1954 and SKBR3, attracted ourattention. Therefore we intended testing for edgetic muta-
tions, as discussed by Zhong et al. [62], leading to AKT
gain-of-function in HCC1954. Such mutations, perturb-ing not a node but an edge of a network, are speculated to
have deeper impact on phenotypic manifestation of a dis-
ease. In detail, we removed each of the AKT stimulatingedges outgoing from p70S6K, PDK1, mTOR and ErbB-
3, alone or in all possible eleven combinations. We then
computed the attractor states for the modified networksin HCC1954.
Removal of the connections of mTOR, PDK1 and ErbB-3
alone or combined had no influence on improving drugeffects, i.e. AKT just got inactive under pertuzumab treat-
ment. Involvement of p70S6K →AKT in the withdrawal
process led to much better results. Removed alone or indouble combinations with the aforementioned edges, as
well as in the two triple combinations containing mTOR,
AKT was deactivated under all drug treatments, but not
yet trastuzumab alone. Finally, simultaneous removal of
the outgoing connections from p70S6K, ErbB-3 and PDK1with or without mTOR, turned out as the only combina-
tion enabling potency of all possible drug combinations,including trastuzumab alone. This hinted at a less strong
impact of mTOR on AKT here, but indicated synergistic
drug resistance potential of p70S6K, ErbB-3 and PDK1,
also due to the newly inferred edges.
Long-term signalling network reconstruction
The reconstructed long-term signalling networks per cellline are displayed in the Additional file 6. Additional
file 5 lists the equivalent Boolean logical interaction
rules. Compared to the prior network, most of thenewly inferred edges were individual for each cell line,
but HCC1954 shared ErbB-1 →ERK1/2 with SKBR3, for
example. This seemed to be an indirect edge via cRAF,
as represented in the prior network. Besides activat-
ing connections, also inhibiting ones and edge deletionsoccurred. For HCC1954, ten new interactions were recon-
structed, while two were deleted. In BT474, nine new
links were added, and one edge was deleted. In SKBR3,we inferred 20 new connections and one deletion, namely
the removal of p53 activation via p38, bearing oncogenic
risk [63,64].
In contrast to the short-term networks, new feedback
loops were reconstructed in every cell line, not exclu-
sively in HCC1954. In HCC1954, the mutual activationbetween p53 and RB established such a feedback mecha-
nism. For SKBR3 we even inferred two edges, each form-
ing feedback loops. Contrary to HCC1954, p53 inhibitedRB. The second loop connection was inhibition of ErbB-
3 by AKT, pointing to a negative feedback against PI3K
signalling [65-67].
In HCC1954, the newly inferred edges Cyclin B1 →AKT
and ErbB-3 →ErbB-1 contributed to PI3K signalling, of
which the latter was explainable as heterodimers. The
newly inferred edge cJUN →ErbB-1 in HCC1954 also
indicated raised activity of ErbB-1. Interestingly, in SKBR3we conducted an inhibiting edge from Cyclin B1 to AKT
but instead an activating one to ERK1/2, contributing to
MAPK signalling, which was also stated by Abrieu et al.[68]. Another new edge in HCC1954 involved a cell cycle
player, i.e. activation of Cyclin D1 by p70S6K [69]. Accord-
ingly, we inferred RPS6 →Cyclin D1 in BT474, with RPS6
as downstream target of p70S6K. In SKBR3, the edge
p70S6K →Cyclin B1 was reconstructed. A further inter-
esting new activating edge in HCC1954 led from RB toTSC2, while we inferred a reversed inhibition in SKBR3.
Searle et al. discussed targeting RB deficient cancers by
deactivating TSC2 [70].
Two novel interactions in BT474 activated Cyclin B1,
arising from ErbB-1 and ErbB-3, respectively, which
meant that mitosis was driven by ErbB-1/3 dimers in this
cell line. This indicated a hyperactive PI3K pathway, as
revealed in the short-term case.
In SKBR3, we reconstructed an outgoing edge from
the artificial network stimulus S, representing full growth

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/8/75
medium, activating AKT. This could be explained as
strong activation of AKT, driving PI3K signalling in
this cell line. The new edges ErbB-2 →TSC2 and ErbB-
3→PRAS had to be interpreted as indirect effects, too.
They pointed to activity of ErbB-2/3 dimers, feeding
into both, MAPK and PI3K, pathways. The edge ErbB-
2→TSC2 could imply an oncogenic role of TSC2. Liu et al.
discussed a context dependent functionality of TSC2 [71].
Perturbation simulations on long-term networks
Similarly to the perturbation simulations for the short-
term networks, we performed those for the long-term
networks under all eight initial state combinations of the
therapeutics erlotinib, pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Also
here, all inferred attractors were simple and consisted ofone steady-state. Table 3 contains the simulation results
for the attractors of the RPS6 and RB proteins, as those
are key players in cell growth and proliferation and mainlycomparable to the experimental results of Henjes et al.
[28] for HCC1954 and SKBR3. We analysed the attractor
states of AKT and ERK1/2, too, but the results are notexplicitly listed, since they mostly resembled the ones of
RPS6.
The control measurements without any drug treatment
should result in activation of ErbB members and dimeri-
sation events, promoting cell growth and proliferation. In
fact, this was expressed as reasonable activation of AKT,ERK1/2 and RPS6 in all cell lines, which held for simu-
lations as well as experimental observations. In contrast,
the attractor states of RB were inactive in all cell lines
(Table 3). Actually, a continuously rising stimulation effect
over 30 hours was not observed for HCC1954 and SKBR3by Henjes et al. [28] either.The attractor states of RPS6 and RB were identical in all
cell lines (Table 3). All drugs, except trastuzumab under
stimulation alone, led to inactive attractor states of RPS6.
This was also the case for ERK1/2 in all cell lines, as wellas AKT in BT474 and HCC1954. In SKBR3, the attractor
states of AKT were just inactive without the stimulus. All
therapeutics, including trastuzumab, resulted in deacti-vated attractor states of RB. The statistically inferred drug
effects for AKT, ERK1/2, RB and RPS6 were slightly differ-
ent. Table 4 summarises the optimal drug combinations,confirming and extending the observations of Henjes
et al. [28]. Most of them were supported by the perturba-
tion simulation results, corresponding to attractor statesof AKT, ERK1/2, RB and RPS6 being zero.
The optimal long-term drug response for AKT and ERK1/2
confirms short-term observations
As shown in Figure 7, the best drug response in BT474
and HCC1954 regarding AKT was yielded for a combina-
tion of trastuzumab and erlotinib. Statistically, we inferred
no positive effect in BT474 at all, which is explainableby the fact that we just considered a combined effect of
drug treatment and time. Although the time courses of
AKT signalling with and without the drug treatment werediffering in the intensity strength, the signalling profiles
were similar. This parallel shift indicated no time effect.
Instead, the group effect was significant (p-value <2·
10
−16). This was also the explanation, why we detected
erlotinib, but not the combination with trastuzumab, as
the optimal treatment in HCC1954 (Table 4). In SKBR3,w ei n f e r r e dt h et r i p l ed r u gc o m b i n a t i o na st h eo p t i m a l
one, but the combination of both monoclonal antibodies
alone also had a significant effect over time (Figure 7).

The table summarises the optimal drug treatments for the long-term data,
leading to inactive AKT, ERK1/2, RB and RPS6, respectively. In case of a significant
(p-value <0.05) combined influence of both, drug treatment and time, on the
protein signal intensity, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted for the
measurements at time point 30 hours, testing for significantly (p-value <0.05)
smaller intensity values under the drug treatment compared to the control
measurement. The drug treatment with the smallest p-value was considered as
the optimal inhibitor. No inferred significant positive drug effect is denoted by ‘-’.
The therapeutics erlotinib, trastuzumab and pertuzumab are abbreviated bytheir first letters. More than one letter denotes drug combinations. The column
Cell line holds the cell lines under consideration. The columns AKT,ERK1/2 ,RB
andRPS6 hold the optimal drug combinations for each target. If those were
confirmed by the attractor states (0) of perturbation simulations, they are
printed in bold.
Hence, like in the short-term results, a drug combination
was required to suppress PI3K signalling, here with an
obvious need for trastuzumab. For BT474 and HCC1954,
this was supported by the simulation results, in whichtrastuzumab alone had no effect, but was efficient within
drug combinations. In HCC1954, even the best drugresponse was not convincing (Figure 7), pointing to a
dominant PI3K pathway, as revealed in the short-term
analysis.
Interestingly, SKBR3 showed a strong activation peak of
AKT phosphorylation between 8 and 18 hours (Figure 7),
which was just suppressed under combined application of
trastuzumab and pertuzumab. We revealed a positive cor-relation with ERK1/2 (p-value 0.02, Kendall’s τestimate
0.6) and RPS6 (p-value 0.01, Kendall’s τestimate 0.64).
The reconstructed edges S →AKT and ErbB-1 →ERK1/2
in SKBR3 indicated strong activation of AKT and ERK1/2.
In addition to the prior network, in which AKT and
ERK1/2 fed into RPS6 phosphorylation via p70S6K, someof the novel edges pointed to a positive feedback from
p70S6K or RPS6 to ERK1/2. The feedback from p70S6K
via Cyclin B1, for example, was expressed by the edgesp70S6K →Cyclin B1 and Cyclin B1 →ERK1/2. Compared
to the short-term results, indicating a dominant MAPK
pathway, this long-term observation indicated strong sig-
nalling via both, PI3K and MAPK, pathways in SKBR3.
As displayed in Figure 8, erlotinib alone or in combina-
tion with trastuzumab showed the optimal effect against
ERK1/2 in all of the three cell lines. This was in line
with the short-term observations, and confirmed by the

perturbation simulations. Statistically, the most potent
drug effect was yielded with the combination of erlotinib
and trastuzumab (Table 4).
Quick drug response for RPS6 and delayed response for RB
As shown in Figure 9, in BT474, the simulation based
predicted efficacy of erlotinib alone to counteract RPS6
(Table 3) was not as convincing as in case of drug combi-nations. A combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab
worked best (Table 4). For RB, the simulated drug
effects in BT474 resembled the observed ones (Table 3,Figure 10), with a positive effect of all measured drug
treatments. Erlotinib was inferred as the optimal treat-
ment (Table 4). Though, the drug impact unfolded notbefore 18 hours.
In HCC1954, it was the combination of both mon-
oclonal antibodies, that failed in deactivating RPS6(Figure 9), while the simulations predicted trastuzumab
alone to fail (Table 3). The graphical observations were
similar for RB (Figure 10). The newly inferred edges ErbB-
3→ErbB-1 and cJUN →ErbB-1 in HCC1954 explained the
necessity for erlotinib against ErbB-1 dimers. The positiveimpact of erlotinib, the optimal treatment against RB sig-
nalling (Table 4), was supported by simulations. However,
it did not unfold before 12-18 hours, in case of RB aswell as RPS6. Regarding RPS6, no significant effect was
detected for HCC1954 (Table 4).
According to Henjes et al. [28], in SKBR3 erlotinib and
all therapeutic combinations helped to suppress RPS6,
which was supported by the simulations (Table 3). As
shown in Figure 9, the combination of trastuzumab anderlotinib was the only one, that revealed its continuous
inhibiting effect already after one hour. This combined
treatment was also statistically inferred as the optimal one
(Table 4). The same combination was optimal with respect
to RB activity, which was also in line with the simulations.Here, analogously to BT474 and HCC1954, the drug effect
did not appear before 18 hours (Figure 10).
As the combination of trastuzumab and erlotinib was
efficient in all of the three cell lines against RPS6 as well
as RB phosphorylation, we further analysed target correla-
tions under this drug combination to explain the differentrapidness of drug responses.
In BT474, RB positively correlated with Cyclin B1 (p-
value 0.02, Kendall’s τestimate 0.6), while RPS6 positively
correlated with ERK1/2 (p-value 0.02, Kendall’s τesti-
mate 0.6). Obviously, RPS6 was mainly stimulated by
the MAPK pathway, which was efficiently inhibited bythe combination of trastuzumab and erlotinib in a fast
manner. On the contrary, RB seemed to be influencedpaper_27	lymphocyte leukemia

T cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia features a clonal
expansion of antigen-primed, competent, cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL). To systematically understand signaling components thatdetermine the survival of CTL in T-LGL leukemia, we constructed aT-LGL survival signaling network by integrating the signalingpathways involved in normal CTL activation and the known de-regulations of survival signaling in leukemic T-LGL. This networkwas subsequently translated into a predictive, discrete, dynamicmodel. Our model suggests that the persistence of IL-15 and PDGFis sufﬁcient to reproduce all known deregulations in leukemicT-LGL. This ﬁnding leads to the following predictions: ( i) Inhibiting
PDGF signaling induces apoptosis in leukemic T-LGL. ( ii) Sphin-
gosine kinase 1 and NF
/H9260B are essential for the long-term survival
of CTL in T-LGL leukemia. ( iii)N F/H9260B functions downstream of PI3K
and prevents apoptosis through maintaining the expression ofmyeloid cell leukemia sequence 1. ( iv) T box expressed in T cells
(T-bet) should be constitutively activated concurrently with NF
/H9260B
activation to reproduce the leukemic T-LGL phenotype. We vali-dated these predictions experimentally. Our study provides amodel describing the signaling network involved in maintainingthe long-term survival of competent CTL in humans. The model willbe useful in identifying potential therapeutic targets for T-LGLleukemia and generating long-term competent CTL necessary fortumor and cancer vaccine development.

T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation normally involves
an initial expansion of antigen-specific CTL clones and their
acquisition of cytotoxic activity. Subsequently, the activated CTLpopulation undergoes activation-induced cell death (AICD),resulting in final stabilization of a small antigen-experiencedCTL population (1). This process requires a delicate balancebetween proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. T cell largegranular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia is characterized byabnormal clonal expansion of antigen-primed mature CTL thatsuccessfully escaped AICD and remain long-term competent(2). Similar to normal activated CTL, leukemic T-LGL exhibitactivation of multiple survival signaling pathways (3–5). How-ever, unlike normal activated CTL, leukemic T-LGL are notsensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis (6), a process essential forAICD (7). Recent molecular profiling data suggest that normalCTL activation and AICD are uncoupled in leukemic T-LGL(8), providing a unique opportunity to decipher the key medi-ators of CTL activation and AICD in humans.
Network modeling has been increasingly used to better un-
derstand complex and interactive biological systems (9, 10).Experimentally obtained signaling pathway information can betranslated into a graph (network) by representing proteins,
transcripts, and small molecules as network nodes and denotingthe interactions between nodes as edges (9). The direction ofedges follows the direction of the mass or information flow, fromthe upstream (source) node to the downstream (product or
target) node. In addition, the edges are characterized by signs,where a positive sign indicates activation, and a negative signindicates inhibition. Discrete dynamic modeling is widely used inmodeling regulatory and signaling networks because of itsstraightforwardness, robustness, and compatibility with qualita-tive data (9–11). The simplest discrete models, called Booleanmodels, assume two possible states for each node in the network:ON (above threshold) and OFF (below threshold). The biolog-ical functions by which upstream regulators act on a downstreamnode can be readily translated into logical statements by usingBoolean operators.
In this study, we aimed to systematically understand the
long-term survival of competent CTL in T-LGL leukemia byconstructing a T-LGL survival signaling network and a Booleanmodel of the network’s dynamics. We found the constitutivepresence of IL-15 and PDGF to be sufficient to reproduce all ofthe other signaling abnormalities. In addition, we studied thepredicted key mediators of long-term CTL survival and theirrelated signaling pathways.
Results
Constructing the T-LGL Survival Signaling Network. We performed
an extensive literature search and constructed the T-LGL sur-vival signaling network (shown in Fig. 1) by adapting andsimplifying a network describing the normal CTL activation–AICD process. The detailed method of network construction isdescribed in supporting information (SI) Text. The information
used to construct the network, summarized by giving the sourcenode, target node, two qualifiers of the relationship, and refer-ences, is given in Table S1 . The nomenclature of all of the nodes
of the network before and after simplification is provided inTables S2 and S3 . The T-LGL survival signaling network incor-
porates the most unique interactions through which all knownderegulations in leukemic T-LGL are connected, in the contextof normal CTL activation and AICD signaling. Proteins, mRNAs,and small molecules (such as lipids) were represented as nodes.‘‘Cytoskeleton signaling’’, ‘‘Proliferation’’ and ‘‘Apoptosis’’ werealso included as nodes to summarize the biological effects of agroup of components in the signaling pathways and serve as the

indicators of cell fate. Because of the unknown etiology of
T-LGL leukemia (2), we used ‘‘Stimuli’’ as a node to indicate
antigen stimulation (12). This network contains 58 nodes and 123edges. The biological description of the T-LGL survival signalingnetwork is given in SI Text .
Translating the T-LGL Survival Signaling Network into a Predictive,
Discrete, Dynamic Model. To understand the dynamics of signaling
abnormalities in T-LGL leukemia, we translated the T-LGLsurvival signaling network into a Boolean model. Each networknode was described by one of two possible states: ON or OFF.The ON state means the production of a small molecule, theproduction and translation of a transcript, or the activation of aprotein/process whereas the OFF state means the absence of asmall molecule or transcript or the inhibition of a protein/process. The regulation of each component in the network wasdescribed by using the Boolean logical operators OR, AND, andNOT (see Table S4 ). OR represents the combined effect of
independent upstream regulators on a downstream nodewhereas AND indicates the conditional dependency of upstreamregulators to achieve a downstream effect. NOT represents theeffect of inhibitory regulators and can be combined with acti-vating regulations by using either OR or AND. The rules werederived from the regulatory relationships reflected in the net-work and from the literature. The detailed justification of thelogical rules for all nodes in the network is provided in SI Text .
As in the biological system, there is a time lag between the statechange of the regulators and the state change of the targets. Thekinetics of signal propagation is rarely known from experiments.Thus, we used an asynchronous updating algorithm (10, 11) thatsamples differences in the speed of signal propagation. Thedetailed algorithm is described in SI Text .
To reproduce how a population of cells responds to the same
signal and to simulate cell-to-cell variability, we performedmultiple simulations with the same initial conditions but differ-ent updating orders (i.e., different timing). The model wasallowed to update for multiple rounds until the node Apoptosisbecame ON in all simulations (recapitulating the death of allCTL) or stabilized in the OFF state in a fraction of simulations(recapitulating the stabilization of the long-term surviving CTLpopulation). The state of Stimuli was set to ON at the beginningof every simulation, recapitulating the activation of CTL byantigen. The states of the other nodes were set according to theirstates in resting T cells, as described in the SI Text . At the end
of the simulation, if the state of a node stabilized at ON even
though it was OFF at the beginning of the simulation, weconsider it as constitutively active. If the state of a nodestabilized at OFF even though it was in the ON state at thebeginning of the simulation, or it was experimentally shown tobe active after normal CTL activation, we consider it as down-regulated/inhibited. During simulations, the state of a node canbe fixed to reproduce signaling perturbations.
Constitutive Presence of IL-15 and PDGF Is Predicted to Be Sufficient
to Induce All of the Known Signaling Abnormalities in Leukemic T-LGL.
Zambello et al. (13) has demonstrated the presence of mem-
brane-bound IL-15 on leukemic LGL, suggesting a role of IL-15in the pathogenesis of this disease. In the course of studyingconstitutive cytokine production in LGL leukemia (14), we useda protein array as an experimental method. Using this array, wehad found high levels of PDGF in LGL leukemia sera (unpub-lished observation). PDGF exists in the form of homodimers orheterodimers of two polypeptides: PDGF-A and PDGF-B (15).In the current study, we examined the level of PDGF-BB levelin the sera of 22 T-LGL leukemia patients and 39 healthy donorsand found that PDGF-BB was significantly higher in patientserum compared with normal ( P/H110210.005) (Fig. 2 A). We
subsequently incorporated this deregulation into the networkmodel.
To investigate signaling abnormalities underlying long-term
survival of leukemic T-LGL, we first tested whether our modelcould reproduce the uncoupling of CTL activation and AICD byusing all known deregulations (summarized in Table S5 ). We did
not observe the activation of the node Apoptosis in any simu-lation. Second, we probed whether all of the deregulations haveto be individually initiated or whether a subset of them can causethe others. The effect of a single signaling perturbation can beidentified by keeping the state of the corresponding nodeaccording to its deregulation and tracking the states of othernodes until a stable (time-independent) state is obtained. IL-15,PDGF, and Stimuli are three nodes that have been suggested tobe abnormal in T-LGL leukemia without known upstreamregulators in the T-LGL survival-signaling network. To recapit-ulate the effect of their deregulations without masking the effectof the perturbation tested, the states of IL-15, PDGF, andStimuli were randomly set at ON or OFF at every round of

updating, i.e., in a random state, except when probing for the
effect of their own deregulations.
Through this analysis, we discovered a hidden hierarchy
among the known deregulations in leukemic T-LGL, with up-stream deregulations as the potential cause of downstreamderegulations. We present these regulatory relationships as ahierarchical network in Fig. 2 B. Details of the hierarchy analysis
are provided in SI Text . Surprisingly, we found that keeping the
state of IL-15 at ON was sufficient to reproduce all knownderegulations in leukemic T-LGL when setting a random statefor PDGF and Stimuli ( Fig. S1 ). To understand the effect of
PDGF and Stimuli individually upon the constant presence ofIL-15, we probed all of the possible states of PDGF and Stimuli.We determined that the presence of PDGF is needed for thelong-term survival of leukemic T-LGL. In contrast, the consti-tutive presence of Stimuli is not required after its initial activa-tion (Fig. 2 C). We concluded that based on the available
signaling information regarding T cell activation and AICD, theminimal condition required for our model to reproduce allknown signaling abnormalities in T-LGL leukemia (i.e., a T-LGL-like state) is IL-15 constantly ON, PDGF intermittentlyON, and Stimuli ON in the initial condition.
To test the unexpected prediction that PDGF signaling,
together with IL-15, maintains leukemic T-LGL survival, weinhibited PDGF receptor by using its specific inhibitor AG 1296.As shown in Fig. 2 D, AG 1296 induced apoptosis specifically in
T-LGL leukemia peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)but not in normal PBMCs ( n/H110053–4, P/H110210.03).
Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) Is Important for the Survival of Leuke-
mic T-LGL. The next question we asked was: Can we identify the
key mediators that determine the uncoupling of CTL activationand AICD in T-LGL leukemia? In our experimental system, theindication that a protein (small molecule or complex) is a keymediator in the finding that altering its amount or function caninduce apoptosis in leukemic T-LGL. Accordingly, a corre-sponding network node is a key mediator if its state stabilizesonce a T-LGL-like state is achieved, and altering its stateincreases the frequency of the ON state of Apoptosis. Thedetailed method to identify key mediators is provided in SI Text .
As summarized in Table S6 , experiments already suggested nine
key mediators. We first tested whether our model could identifythe corresponding nodes as key mediators. A rapid increase ofapoptosis frequency was observed after resetting and maintain-ing the states of all of the known key mediators individually totheir opposite states (from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON) afterreproducing a T-LGL-like state. Examples of simulation resultsare provided in Fig. S2 .
Based on this result, we systematically simulated the effect of
individually altering the states of all nodes that stabilize when aT-LGL-like state is achieved. A list of these nodes is provided inTable S7 . In addition to PDGF and its receptor, the model
predicted seven additional key mediators: SPHK1, NF
/H9260B, S1P,
SOCS, GAP, BID, and IL2RB, all exhibiting a similar dynamicsof inducing apoptosis in the model. Fig. 3 Ashows the effect of
inhibiting SPHK1 as an example. Recently, we found that thesphingolipid signaling is deregulated in leukemic LGL (8). Thus,we tested the effect of SPHK1 inhibition on leukemic T-LGLsurvival experimentally by using its chemical inhibitors, SPHK1inhibitor-I and -II (SKI-I and SKI-II) (16, 17). As shown in Figs.3BandC, both SKI-I and SKI-II significantly induced apoptosis
in T-LGL leukemia PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner but notin normal PBMCs ( n/H110054–6, P/H110210.03).
NF/H9260B Maintains the Survival of Leukemic T-LGL Through STAT3-
Independent Regulation of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1).
Our model predicts that NF /H9260B is constitutively active and is a key
mediator of the survival of leukemic T-LGL (Fig. 4 A). Consid-
ering its importance in regulating T cell proliferation, cytotox-icity, and survival (18), we studied the activity and function ofNF
/H9260B in T-LGL leukemia. As shown in Fig. 4 B, nuclear extracts
of normal PBMCs rarely exhibited NF /H9260B activity as assessed by
EMSA whereas NF /H9260B activity was detected in most of the
nuclear extracts of T-LGL leukemia PBMCs.
Next, we examined the effect of inhibiting NF /H9260B by using its
specific inhibitor BAY 11–7082 (19, 20). As shown in Fig. 4 C,
BAY 11–7082 inhibited the constitutive activity of NF /H9260Bi n
T-LGL leukemia PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner as as-
Fig. 2. The Boolean model of the T-LGL survival signaling network predicts
that constitutive presence of IL-15, and PDGF is sufﬁcient to induce all of theknown deregulations in T-LGL leukemia. ( A) PDGF-BB is elevated in T-LGL
leukemia patient sera compared with normal. Serum level of PDGF-BB from 39healthy donors (gray triangles) and 22 T-LGL leukemia patients (white dia-monds) was assessed by using ELISA. The ﬁgure shows a 1.4-fold increase ofmean serum level of PDGF-BB (black bar) in T-LGL leukemia patients comparedwith normal (

apoptosis in T-LGL leukemia PBMCs but not in normal PBMCs(n/H110056,P/H110210.009) (Fig. 4 D).
Based on the Boolean logical rule for NF
/H9260B (see Table S4 ),it can be activated by PI3K or tumor progression locus 2
(TPL2)/cancer Osaka thyroid. During simulations, however, wenoticed that the ON state of NF
/H9260B was only determined by the
constitutive activity of PI3K because resetting the state of PI3Kfrom ON to OFF was necessary and sufficient to induce the rapidinhibition of NF
/H9260B whereas altering the state of TPL2 did not
affect NF /H9260B activity (Fig. 5 A). We then subjected the T-LGL
leukemia PBMCs to PI3K specific inhibitor LY 294002 andtested the effect on NF
/H9260B activity. LY 294002 (25 /H9262M) signif-
icantly inhibited the activity of NF /H9260B as assessed by EMSA (Fig.
5B) and induced apoptosis in T-LGL leukemia PBMCs (data not
shown) as reported (4). BAY 11–7082 did not inhibit the activity
(phosphorylation) of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogen ho-molog (AKT), an immediate downstream target of PI3K in T-LGLleukemia PBMCs, as assessed by Western blot assay (Fig. 5 C).
We found that for simulations in which we reset the state of
NF
/H9260B from ON to OFF, the onset of apoptosis correlated tightly
with the rapid down-regulation of Mcl-1 (Fig. 4 A). It has been
shown that STAT3 transcriptionally regulates Mcl-1 in leukemicT-LGL (3). Interestingly, our model predicted that the initialMcl-1 down-regulation after NF
/H9260B inhibition was independent
of STAT3 activity (Fig. 4 A). Our experimental results confirmed
this prediction. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the amount of Mcl-1 after
BAY 11–7082 treatment did indeed decrease correspondingly tothe decreased NF
/H9260B activity whereas STAT3 activity remained
unchanged after NF /H9260B inhibition, as assessed by EMSA, even at
the highest dose of BAY 11–7082.

model, this apparent conflict can be resolved if T-bet is consti-

Fig. 5. NF/H9260B-mediated survival pathway in T-LGL leukemia involves PI3K and

‘‘NFKB* /H11005[(TPL2 or PI3K) or (FLIP and TRADD and IAP)] and not Apoptosis’’.
When a T-LGL-like state is achieved, the state of TRADD stabilizes at OFF (seeTable S7 ). Thus, the node that activates NF
/H9260B can only be TPL2 or PI3K, which
are known to be constitutively active in T-LGL leukemia (see Table S5 ). Rapid
inhibition of NF /H9260B (white squares) was observed after inhibiting PI3K (X) but
not after inhibiting TPL2 (gray triangles) (200 simulations). ( B) PI3K inhibition

tutively active. As shown in Fig. 6 A, when a T-LGL-like state was
achieved, the state of T-bet stabilized at ON, and there was arapid increase of IL-2 production when the state of T-bet wasreset to OFF. In agreement with the model’s prediction, T-betwas significantly elevated in T-LGL leukemia PBMCs comparedwith normal PBMCs at both mRNA and protein levels, asassessed by real-time PCR and Western blot assay (Figs. 6 Band
C). In addition, T-LGL leukemia PBMCs exhibited high T-bet
activity as assessed by EMSA whereas the T-bet activity wasalmost undetectable in normal PBMCs (Fig. 6 D).
Discussion
The long-term survival of competent CTL in T-LGL leukemia
offers a unique opportunity to reveal the key mediators of CTLactivation and AICD in humans. In this study, we curated thesignaling pathways involved in normal CTL activation, AICD,and the deregulations in leukemic T-LGL and compiled theminto a T-LGL survival signaling network. By formulating aBoolean dynamic model of this network, we were able to identifythe potential causes and key regulators of this abnormal survival.
Signaling pathways are complex and dynamic. However, ex-
perimental results are usually focused on limited interactions ofthe components in one pathway and neglecting the broadereffects in the same or other pathways. Integrating existingpathway information to infer cross-talk among pathways isdesirable, especially for studies in T-LGL leukemia where ex-perimental data are limited. Using network theory as a tool, weidentified the most unique interactions among known deregu-lated components in leukemic T-LGL in the context of CTLactivation and AICD and summarized these signaling events inthe form of a network. This served as an innovative platform tounderstand the abnormal CTL survival in T-LGL leukemia.
Multiple perturbations of signaling pathways in a disease can
result from deregulation of only a subset of these pathways.However, identifying such a subset is difficult experimentally. Inthis study, we assessed this question in T-LGL leukemia by usinga Boolean dynamic model. Through network simulations, werevealed the hierarchy among deregulated nodes in terms ofdetermining other signaling abnormalities in leukemic T-LGL.The simultaneously constitutive presence of IL-15 and PDGFwas shown to be sufficient to induce all know deregulations after
initial T cell activation.
Leukemic T-LGL are suggested to be antigen-primed (12),
long-term competent CTL (22), similar to terminally differen-tiated effector memory cells (T
EMRA ) (23). It is worth noting that
IL-15 has been shown to be important for CTL activation andgeneration of long-lived CD8 /H11001memory cells (24, 25). Both theCD8/H11001cells in the IL15 transgenic mice (26) and the IL15
transduced primary human CD8 /H11001cells (27) indeed showed
similar phenotypes as leukemic T-LGL. However, IL-15 alonecannot fully inhibit the onset of apoptosis in our model (Fig. 2 C).
Increased PDGF production occurs under inflammatory condi-tions (28), and it has been shown to exert an inhibitory effecttoward CTL activation (29). We had found that LGL leukemiais characterized by production of proinflammatory cytokines(14). Here, we showed an increased level of PDGF in T-LGLpatient sera. Our model and the following validation revealedthat both pro- and anti-T cell activation signals are neededsimultaneously to maintain the competency and survival of CTLin T-LGL leukemia. Our finding also suggests that provision ofIL-15 and PDGF may be a strategy to generate long-lived CTLnecessary for the development of virus and cancer vaccines.
Focusing on the effect of nodes on apoptosis in leukemic
T-LGL, we revealed nodes that determine the uncoupling ofCTL activation and AICD. We experimentally validated twopredicted key mediators: SPHK1 and NF
/H9260B, the inhibition of
which induces apoptosis in leukemic T-LGL. It is worth notingthat although NF
/H9260B has been suggested to inhibit apoptosis in
CTL (30), its function in maintaining long-term CTL survivalremains elusive. We validated the prediction that NF
/H9260Bi s
downstream of PI3K and prevents the onset of apoptosis inleukemic T-LGL through maintaining the expression of Mcl-1independent of STAT3, another regulator of Mcl-1 in T-LGLleukemia (3).
The confirmation of the constitutive NF
/H9260B activation led to
the validation of the constitutive T-bet activation in T-LGLleukemia predicted by our model. T-bet plays an important rolein coupling the effector and memory CD8 /H11001T cell fate (31). It
also inhibits the production of IL-2, which is known to be absentin leukemic T-LGL and in T
EMRA (23, 32). T-bet has been
related to multiple autoimmune diseases in humans (33–36).T-LGL leukemia has important overlaps with autoimmune
disorders, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (2). The overexpres-sion and constitutive activity of T-bet in leukemic T-LGL mayhelp to reveal the common pathogenesis between T-LGL leu-kemia and other autoimmune diseases.
With the exponential increase of signaling pathway information,
it is becoming more difficult to determine pathway interactions ina particular experimental system. In this study, we used networkanalysis and Boolean modeling to investigate the signaling abnor-malities in T-LGL leukemia. This systems biology approach wasable to maximize the use of the available pathway information andto identify the key mediators of CTL survival, highlighting theirimportance as potential therapeutic targets for T-LGL leukemia00.20.40.60.81

Abstract
We present a novel methodology to construct a Boolean dynamic model from time series
metagenomic information and integrate this modeling with genome-scale metabolic networkreconstructions to identify metabolic underpinnings for microbial interactions. We apply thisin the context of a critical health issue: clindamycin antibiotic treatment and opportunisticClostridium difficile infection. Our model recapitulates known dynamics of clindamycin anti-
biotic treatment and C.difficile infection and predicts therapeutic probiotic interventions to
suppress C.difficile infection. Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions reveal met-
abolic differences between community members and are used to explore the role of metab-
olism in the observed microbial interactions. In vitro experimental data validate a key result
of our computational model, that B.intestinihominis can in fact slow C.difficile growth.
Author Summary
The community of bacteria that live in our intestines (called the “gut microbiome ”) is im-
portant to normal intestinal function, and destruction of this community has a causativerole in diseases including obesity, diabetes, and even neurological disorders. Clostridum
difficile is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that causes potentially life-threatening
intestinal inflammation and diarrhea and frequently occurs after antibiotic treatment,which wipes out the normal intestinal bacterial community. We use a mathematical model
to identify how the normal bacterial community interacts and how this community
changes with antibiotic treatment and C.difficile infection. We use this model to identify
bacteria that may inhibit C.difficile growth. Our model and subsequent experiments indi-
cate that Barnesiella intestinihominis inhibits C.difficile growth. This result suggests that
B.intestinihominis could potentially be used as a probiotic to treat or prevent C.difficile
infection.

Introduction
Human health is inseparably connected to the billions of microbes that live in and on us. Cur-
rent research shows that our associations with microbes are, more often than not, essential for
our health [ 1]. The microbes that live in and on us (collectively our “microbiome ”) help us to
digest our food, train our immune systems, and protect us from pathogens [ 2,3]. The gut
microbiome is an enormous community, consisting of hundreds of species and trillions of indi-vidual interacting bacteria [ 4]. Microbial community composition often persists for years with-
out significant change [ 5].
When change comes, however, it can have unpredictable and sometimes fatal consequences.
Acute and recurring infections by Clostridium difficile have been strongly linked to changes in
gut microbiota [ 6]. The generally accepted paradigm is that antibiotic treatment (or some
other perturbation) significantly disrupts the microbial community structure in the gut, which
creates a void that C.difficile will subsequently fill [ 7–10]. Such infections occur in roughly
600,000 people in the United States each year (this number is on the rise), with an associated
mortality rate of 2.3% [ 11]. Each year, healthcare costs associated with C.difficile infection are
in excess of $3.2 billion [ 11]. An altered gut flora has further been identified as a causal factor
in obesity, diabetes, some cancers and behavioral disorders [ 12-17].
What promotes the stability of a microbial community, or causes its collapse, is poorly
understood. Until we know what promotes stability, we cannot design targeted treatments thatprevent microbiome disruption, nor can we rebuild a disrupted microbiome. Studying the sys-
tem level properties and dynamics of a large community is impossible using traditional micro-
biology approaches. However, network science is an emerging field which provides a powerfulframework for the study of complex systems like the gut microbiome [ 18–23]. Previous efforts
to capture the essential dynamics of the gut have made heavy use of ordinary differential equa-
tion (ODE) models [ 24,25]. Such models require the estimation of many parameters. With so
many degrees of freedom, it is possible to overfit the underlying data, and it is difficult to scaleup to larger communities [ 26,27]. Boolean dynamic models, conversely, require far less param-
eterization. Such models capture the essential dynamics of a system, and scale to larger systems.
Boolean models have been successfully applied at the molecular [ 28,29], cellular [ 20], and com-
munity levels [ 30]. Here we present the first Boolean dynamic model constructed from metage-
nomic sequence information and the first application of Boolean modeling to microbial
community analysis.
We analyze the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome, focusing on the effect of clindamy-
cin antibiotic treatment and C.difficile infection on gut microbial community structure. We
generate a microbial interaction network and dynamical model based on time-series data from
metagenome data from a population of mice. We present the results of a dynamic networkanalysis, including steady-state conditions, how those steady states are reached and main-
tained, how they relate to the health or disease status of the mice, and how targeted changes in
the network can transition the community from a disease state to a healthy state. Furthermore,knowing how microbes positively or negatively impact each other —particularly for key
microbes in the community —increases the therapeutic utility of the inferred interaction net-
work. We produced genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of the taxa represented in thiscommunity [ 31], and probe how metabolism could —and could not —contribute to the mecha-
nistic underpinnings of the observed interactions. We present validating experimental evidence
consistent with our computational results, indicating that a member of the normal gut flora,Barnesiella , can in fact slow C.difficile growth.

Methods
Data Sources
Buffie et al. reported treating mice with clindamycin and tracking microbial abundance by 16S
sequencing [ 32]. Mice treated with clindamycin were more susceptible to C.difficile infection
than controls. The collection of 16S sequences corresponding to these experiments was ana-
lyzed by Stein et al.[24]. First, Stein et al. aggregated the data by quantifying microbial abun-
dance at the genus level. Abundances of the ten most abundant genera and an “other ”group
were presented as operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts per sample. We use the aggre-
gated abundances from Stein et al. as the starting point for our modeling pipeline ( Fig 1 ).
This processed dataset consisted of nine samples and three treatment groups (n = 3 replicates
per treatment group). The first treatment group (here called “Healthy ”)r e c e i v e ds p o r e so f C.dif-
ficile at t = 0 days, and was used to determine the susceptibility of the native microbiota to inva-
sion. The second treatment group (here called “clindamycin treated ”) received a single dose of
clindamycin at t = -1 days to assess the effect of the antibiotic alone, and the third treatment
group (here called “clindamycin+ C.difficile treated ”) received a single dose of clindamycin (at t
= -1 days) and, on the following day, was inoculated with C.difficile spores ( S1A Fig ). Under the
clindamycin+ C.difficile treatment group conditions, C.difficile could colonize the mice and pro-
duce colitis; however this was not possible under the first two treatment group conditions.
Interpolation of Missing Genus Abundance Information
The gut bacterial genus abundance dataset included some variation in terms of time points in
which genera were sampled. That is, genus abundances were measured between 0 to 23 days;
however, not all samples had measurements at all the time points ( S1A Fig ). Particularly, the
healthy population only included time points at 0, 2, 6, and 13 days and Sample 1 of clindamycin+C.difficile treated population was missing the 9 day time point. Missing abundance values for
these 4 points were estimated using an interpolation approach ( S1B Fig ). For healthy samples,
the 16 and 23 day time points could not be interpolated as the last experimentally identified timepoint for these samples is at 13 days. The assumption of the approximated polynomial for these
samples is that extrapolated data points are linear using the slope of the interpolating curve at
the nearest data point. Because genera abundances are fairly stable across time in this treatmentgroup (i.e. the slope of most of the genera abundances is approximately zero), extrapolating two
time points was deemed reasonable. A principal component analysis was completed on the inter-
polated data ( Fig 2A ) and shows that the interpolated time series bacterial genus abundance data
clusters by experimental treatment group in the first two principal components. Furthermore,the results of the binarization for the healthy population suggest that interpolation did not have
any concerning effects on the 16 and 23 day time points ( S2 Fig ).
Natural cubic spline interpolation was used to estimate genus abundances at missing time
points in some samples. A cubic spline is constructed of piecewise third order (cubic) polyno-
mials which pass through the known data points and has continuous first and second deriva-
tives across all points in the dataset. Natural cubic spline is a cubic spline that has a secondderivative equal to zero at the end points of the dataset [ 33]. Natural splines were interpolated
such that all datasets had time points at single day intervals through the 23 day time point
(S1B Fig ).
Network Modeling Framework
We use a Boolean framework in which each network node is described by one of two qualita-
tive states: ON or OFF. We chose this framework because of its computational feasibility and
Network Model of the Gut Microbiome

capacity to be constructed with minimal and qualitative biological data [ 34]. The ON (logical
1) state means an above threshold abundance of a bacterial genus whereas the OFF (logical 0)state means below-threshold genus absence. The putative biological relationships among gen-
era are expressed as mathematical equations using Boolean operators [ 29,34]. We inferred
putative Boolean regulatory functions for each node, which are able to best capture the trendsin the bacterial abundances. These rules, (edges in the interaction network) can be assigned a
direction, representing information flow, i.e. effect from the source (upstream) node to the tar-
get (downstream) node. Furthermore, edges can be characterized as positive (growth promot-ing) or negative (growth suppressing). An additional layer of network analysis is the dynamic
Fig 1. Dynamic analysis workflow. Time course genus abundance information was acquired from metagenomic sequencing of mouse gastrointestinal
tracts under varying experimental conditions. Missing time points from experimental data were estimated such that genus abundances existed at the s ame
time points across all treatment groups. Next, genus abundances were binarized such that Boolean regulatory relationships could be inferred. A dyna mic
Boolean model was constructed to explore gut microbial dynamics, therapeutic interventions, and metabolic mediators of bacterial regulatory rela tionships.

model, which is used to express the behavior of a system over time by characterizing each node
by a state variable (e.g., abundance) and a function that describes its regulation. Dynamic mod-
els can be categorized as continuous or discrete, according to the type of node state variable
used. Continuous models use a set of differential equations; however, the paucity of knownkinetic details for inter-genus and/or inter-species interactions makes these models difficult toimplement.
Binarization
Genus abundance data was binarized (converted to a presence-absence dataset) to enable infer-ence of Boolean relationships for modeling applications. We adapted a previously developed
approach called iterative k-means binarization with a clustering depth of 3 (KM3) for this pur-
pose [ 35]. This approach was employed because binarized data is able to maintain complex

oscillatory behavior in Boolean models constructed from this data, whereas other binarization
approaches fail to maintain these features [ 35].
Briefly, this approach uses k-means clustering with a depth of clustering dand an initial
number of clusters k=2d. In each iteration, data for a specific genus Gare clustered into k
unique clusters C1
G,...,Ck
G, then for each cluster, Cn
G, all the values are replaced by the mean
value of Cn
G. For the next iteration, the value of dis decreased and clustering is repeated. This
methodology is repeated until d= 1. This approach, with d= 3 (called here as KM3 binariza-
tion) has previously been demonstrated as a superior binarization methodology to other binari-
zation approaches for Boolean model construction because it conserves oscillatory behavior
[35]. These analyses were performed using custom Python code based on a previously written
algorithm [ 35] and is available in the supplemental materials.
Because KM3 binarization has a stochastic component (the initial grouping of binarization
clusters), we employed KM3 binarization on the entire bacterial genus abundance time seriesdataset 1000 times. The average binarization for each sample ( S2 Fig ) was used to determine
the most probable binarized state of each genus in each sample at each time point ( S3 Fig ). A
principal component analysis of the most probable binarized genus abundances for each sam-ple demonstrates that as with the continuous time series abundances ( Fig 2A ), binarized bacte-
rial genus abundance data cluster by experimental treatment group ( Fig 2B ). For inference of
Boolean rules from the binarized genus abundances ( S3 Fig ), the consensus of two of three
samples for each treatment population was used as the binarized state of each genus at eachtime point in each sample ( Fig 2C ).
Inference of Boolean Rules from Time Series Genus Abundance
Information
The Best-fit extension was applied to learn Boolean rules from the binarized time series genus
abundance information [ 36]. For each variable (genus) Xiin the binarized time series genus
abundance data, Best-fit identifies the set of Boolean rules with k variables (regulators) that
explains the variable ’s time pattern with the least error size. The algorithm uses partially defined
Boolean functions pdBf (T,F), where the set of true (T) and false vectors (F) are defined as T=
{X02{0, 1}k:Xi(t+ 1) = 1} and F={X02{0, 1}k:Xi(t+ 1) = 0}. Intuitively, the partial Boolean
function summarizes the states of the putative regulators that correspond to a turning ON (T) or
turning OFF (F) of the target variable. The error size εofpdBf(T,F) is defined as the minimum
number of inconsistencies within X0that best classifies the T and F values of the dataset. The
Best-Fit extension works by identifying smallest size X0forXi. For more detailed information
refer to [ 36]. In line with this, we considered the most parsimonious representation of the rules
with the smallest ε. If the most parsimonious rule was self-regulation, we also considered rules
with the same εthat included another regulator. If multiple rules fit these criteria for a given Xi,
it implied that they can independently represent the inferred regulatory relationships. In caseswhere the alternatives had the same value of (non-zero) ε, we explored combinations (such as
appending them by an OR rule) and used the combination that best described the experimentally
observed final (steady state) outcomes. For example, we combined the two alternative rules forBlautia with an OR relationship. In the case of Barnesiella , we chained three rules ("Other",
"Lachnospiraceae_other", "Lachnospiraceae") by an OR relationship, and "not Clindamycin" by
an AND relationship to incorporate the loss of Barnesiella in the presence of clindamycin ( Fig
2C). This was also done for rules for “Lachnospiraceae ”,“Lachnospiraceae_other ”and“Other ”
and all four nodes attained the same rule. There are six nodes with multiple inferred (alternative)
rules: “Barnesiella ”,”Blautia ”,”Enterococcus ”,”Lachnospiraceae ”,”Lachnospiraceae_other ”,a n d ”-
Other ”had 4, 2, 5, 4, 4, and 4 rules, respectively. The six other nodes had a single inferred rule.

The network in Fig 2C represents the union of all of the alternative rules produced by Best-Fit,
or in other words, –it is a super-network of all alternative rules. Any alternative networks would
be a sub-network of what we show. A strongly connected component between the nodes inhib-ited by clindamycin is a feature of the vast majority of these sub-networks. We used the imple-mentation of Best-Fit in the R package BoolNet [ 37].
Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis is performed by applying the inferred Boolean functions in succession until a
steady state is reached. Boolean models and discrete dynamic models in general focus on statetransitions instead of following the system in continuous time. Thus, time is an implicit vari-able in these models. The network transitions from an initial condition (initial state of the bac-
terial community) until an attractor is reached. An attractor can be a fixed point (steady state)
or a set of states that repeat indefinitely (a complex attractor). The basin of attraction refers tothe set of initial conditions that lead the system to a specific attractor. For the network under
consideration, the complete state space can be traversed by enumerating every possible combi-
nation of node states ( 2
12) and applying the inferred Boolean functions (or “update rules ”)t o
determine paths linking those states. The state transition network describes all possible com-
munity trajectories from initial conditions to steady states, given the observed interactions
between bacteria in the community.
We made use of two update schemes to simulate network dynamics: synchronous (deter-
ministic) and asynchronous (stochastic). Synchronous models are the simplest update method:
all nodes are updated at multiples of a common time step based on the previous state of the sys-tem. The synchronous model is deterministic in that the sequence of state transitions is definitefor identical initial conditions of a model. In asynchronous models, the nodes are updated indi-
vidually, depending on the timing information, or lack thereof, of individual biological events.
In the general asynchronous model used here, a single node is randomly updated at each timestep [ 38]. The general asynchronous model is useful when there is heterogeneity in the timing
of network events but when the specific timing is unknown. Due to the heterogeneous mecha-
nisms by which bacteria interact, we made the assumption of time heterogeneity without spe-cifically known time relationships. Synchronous and asynchronous Boolean models have the
same fixed points, because fixed points are independent of the implementation of time. How-
ever, the basin of attraction of each fixed point (i.e. the initial conditions that lead to each fixedpoint) may differ between synchronous and asynchronous models ( S2 Table ). For identifica-
tion of all of the fixed points in the network (the attractor landscape), the synchronous updat-
ing scheme was used. However, for the perturbation analysis, the asynchronous updatingscheme was used because it more realistically models the possible trajectories in a stochasticand/or time-heterogeneous system. The simulations of the gut microbiome model were per-
formed using custom Python code built on top of the BooleanNet Python library, which facili-
tates Boolean simulations [ 39]. Our custom Python code is available in the supplemental
materials.
Perturbation Analysis
To capture the effect of removal (knockout) or addition (probiotic; forced over abundance) of
genera, modification of the states/rules to describe removal or addition states were performed.
These modifications were implemented in BooleanNet by setting the corresponding nodes toeither OFF (removal) or ON (addition) and then removing the corresponding updating rules
for these nodes for the simulations. By examining many such forced perturbations, we can
identify potential therapeutic strategies, many of which may not be obvious or intuitive,

particularly as network complexity increases. We used asynchronous update when simulating
the effect of perturbations on the microbial communities. In each case we performed 1000 sim-
ulations and report the percentage of simulations that achieve a certain outcome.
Generating Genus-Level Genome-Scale Metabolic Reconstructions
To generate draft metabolic network reconstructions for each of the ten genera in the paper,we first obtained genome sequences for representative species by searching the “Genomes ”
database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Complete genomes for
the first ten (or if less than ten, all) species within the appropriate genus were downloaded.During the process of reconstructing genus-level metabolic reconstructions, some genera were
underrepresented (fewer than 10 species genomes) in the NCBI Genome database, including
Akkermansia ,Barnesiella andCoprobacillus (S3 Table ). The search result order is based on
record update time, and so it is quasi-random. Genomes were uploaded to the rapid annota-
tions using subsystems technology (RAST) server for annotation [ 40]. Draft metabolic network
reconstructions were generated by providing the RAST annotations to the Model SEED service[41]. Metabolic network reconstructions were downloaded in “.xls”format. Genus-level meta-
bolic reconstructions were produced by taking the union of all species-level reconstructions
corresponding to each genus, as has been done previously [ 42]. The one exception was C.diffi-
cile, which was produced by taking the union of three strain-level reconstructions.
Subsystem Enrichment Analysis
Subsystems were defined as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) map with
which each reaction was associated [ 43,44]. These associations were determined based on
annotations in the Model SEED database [ 41]. To quantify enrichment, the complete set of
unique reactions from all genus-level reconstructions was pooled, and the subsystem annota-
tions corresponding to those reactions were counted. To determine enrichment for a given sub-
set of the community (either a single genus-level reconstruction, or a set of reconstructionscorresponding to a subnetwork), the subsystem occurrences were counted within the subset.
The probability of a reconstruction containing Ntotal subsystem annotations, with Mor more
occurrences of subsystem I, was determined by taking the sum of a hypergeometric probability
distribution function (PDF) from Mto the total occurrences of subsystem Iin the overall popu-
lation. Enrichment analysis was performed in Matlab [ 45].
Identifying Seed Sets and Defining Metabolic Competition and
Mutualism Scores
To quantify metabolic interactions, we started by utilizing the seed set detection algorithm
developed by Borenstein et al.[46,47]. The algorithm follows three steps:
1. The genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction is reduced into simple one-to-one
edges, such that for each reaction, each substrate and product pair forms an edge (e.g. A+B
!Cwould become A!CandB!C).
2. The network is divided into strongly connected components, those groups of nodes for
which two paths of opposite directions (e.g. A!BandB!A) exist between any two
nodes in the group.
3. Nodes (and strongly connected components with five or fewer nodes) for which there are
exclusively outgoing edges are defined as “inputs ”to the model, or seed metabolites.
Network Model of the Gut Microbiome
PLOS Computational Biology | DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004338 June 23, 2015 8 / 25
The rationale is that metabolites that feed into the network, but cannot be produced by any
reactions within the network, must be obtained from the environment.
Competition metrics were generated following the process of Levy and Borenstein [ 46]. For
a given pair of genera, the competition score is defined as:
CompScoreij¼jSeedSeti\SeedSetjj
jSeedSetijð1Þ
Here SeedSet iis the set of obligatory input metabolites to the metabolic network reconstruc-
tion for genus i, and | SeedSet i| is the number of metabolites contained in SeedSet i. The competi-
tion score indicates the fractional overlap of inputs that genus ishares with genus j, and so
ranges between zero and one. The higher the score, the more similar the metabolic inputs tothe two networks, making competition more likely.
For a given pair of genera, the mutualism score is defined as:
MutualismScore
ij¼jSeedSeti\:SeedSetjj
jSeedSetijð2Þ
Here ¬ SeedSet jis the set of metabolites that can be produced by the metabolic network for
species j(i.e. all non-seed metabolites). The mutualism score indicates the fractional overlap of
inputs that genus iconsumes which genus jcan potentially provide. The mutualism score
ranges between zero and one. The higher the score, the more potential there is for nutrientsharing between species. While the score does not measure “mutualism ”per se (it cannot nec-
essarily distinguish between other interactions such as commensalism or amenalism [ 48]), for
simplicity, we will refer to these scores as the competition and mutualism scores.
All metabolic reconstructions, seed sets, competition scores and mutualism scores are avail-
able in the supplemental materials. Seed set generation was performed using custom Matlab
scripts, which are available in the supplement. [ 45]. Statistical tests were performed in R [ 49].
Co-culture and Spent Media Experiments
Barnesiella intestinihominis DSM 21032 and Clostridium difficile VPI 10463 were grown anaer-
obically in PRAS chopped meat medium (CMB) (Anaerobe Systems, Morgan Hill, CA) at 37
C. To prepare B.intestinihominis spent medium, B.intestinihominis was grown in CMB until
stationary phase (44 hours). The saturated culture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was fil-
ter sterilized (0.22 μM pore size). Growth curves were obtained by inoculating batch cultures in
96-well plates and gathering optical density measurements (870 nm) using a small plate readerthat fits in the anaerobic chamber [ 50]. Single cultures were inoculated from overnight liquid
culture to a starting density of 0.01. The co-cultures were started at a 1:1 ratio, for a total start-
ing density of 0.02. Optical density was measured every 2 minutes for 24 hours, and the result-ing growth curves were analyzed in Matlab [ 45]. Maximum growth rates were calculated by
fitting a smooth line to each growth curve, and finding the maximum growth rate from among
the instantaneous growth rates over the whole time course: [log(OD
t+1)—log(OD t)] / [t +1-t].
The achieved bacterial density —area under the growth curve (AUC) —in a culture was calcu-
lated by integrating over the growth curve in each experiment using the “trapz() ”function in
Matlab. It can be thought of as representing the total biomass produced over time. The simply
additive null model was calculated by fitting a Lotka-Volterra model [ 24] to the single cultures
for both B.intestihominis andC.difficile . The null model of co-culture (assuming zero interac-
tion between species) was simulated by using the parameters from single culture, and summing
the predicted OD870 values.

Results
Processing of a Microbial Genus Abundance Dataset for Network
Inference
To capture the dynamics of inter-genus interactions in the intestinal tract we employed a pipe-
line ( Fig 1 ) which translates metagenomic genus abundance information into a dynamic Bool-
ean model. This approach involves three steps: 1) discretization (binarization) of genus
abundances, 2) learning Boolean relationships among genera, and 3) translation of genus asso-
ciations into a Boolean (discrete) dynamic model.
Construction of a Dynamic Network Model from Binarized Time Series
Microbial Genus Abundance Information
Boolean rules ( S1 Table ) were inferred from the time series binarized genus abundances using
an implementation of the Best-fit extension [ 36] in the R Boolean network inference package
BoolNet [ 37](see Methods ). A network of 12 nodes and 33 edges was inferred ( Fig 2D ). The
inferred interaction network has a clustered structure: the cluster (subnetwork) containing the
twoLachnospiraceae nodes and Barnesiella is strongly influenced by clindamycin whereas the
other subnetwork is largely independent of the first, except for the single edge between Barne-
siella andC.difficile (Fig 2D ). In fact, Lachnospiraceae nodes, Barnesiella and the group of
“Other ”genera form a strongly connected component; that is, every node is reachable from
every other node. Most nodes of the second subnetwork are positively influenced by C.difficile ,
with the exception of Coprobacillus , for which no regulation by other nodes was inferred, and
Akkermansia , which is inferred to be regulated only by Coprobacillus . These latter two genera
are transiently present (around day 5) in the clindamycin treatment group, but they do notappear in the final states of any of the treatment groups (see S1 Fig ). This network structure is
consistent with published data in which the dominant Firmicutes (Lachnospiraceae ) and Bac-
teroidetes (Barnesiella ) are devastated by antibiotic administration [ 51,52]. Furthermore, the
clustered structure ( Fig 2D ) supports the established mechanism of C.difficile colitis: loss of
normal gut flora, which normally suppresses opportunistic infection (clindamycin cluster), and
the presence of C.difficile at a minimum inoculum ( C.difficile cluster) [ 10,53]. The network
clusters have a single route of interaction between Barnesiella andC.difficile .
The negative influence of Barnesiella onC.difficile is in agreement with recently published
findings in which Barnesiella was strongly correlated with C.difficile clearance [ 54]. The role of
Barnesiella as an inhibitor of another pathogen (vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE)) has
been shown in mice [ 55], which is also visible in the network model as an indirect relationship
between Barnesiella andEnterococcus (Fig 2D ). Related species of Bacteroidetes have been
shown to play vital roles in protection from C.difficile infection in mice [ 56]. Furthermore, the
network structure shows that Lachnospiraceae positively interacts with Barnesiella , leading to
an indirect suppression of C.difficile . Interestingly, the two Lachnospiraceae nodes and the
“Other ”node form a strongly connected component, suggesting a similar role in the network,
particularly in promoting growth of Barnesiella , which directly suppresses C.difficile . In sup-
port of this finding, Lachnospiraceae has been shown to protect mice against C.difficile coloni-
zation [ 52,57]. Therefore, the structure of the network is both a parsimonious representation of
the current data set, and is supported by literature evidence.

We applied dynamic analysis using the synchronous updating scheme (see Methods )t o
determine all the possible steady states of the microbiome network model. In a 12 node net-
work, there are 212possible network states. We employed model simulations using the syn-
chronous updating scheme to visit all possible network states and identify all fixed points ofthe model. Exploration of the steady states of this network reveals 23 possible fixed point
attractors ( S4 Fig ). Three of the identified attractors ( Fig 3A ) are in exact agreement with the
experimentally identified terminal time points of binarized genus abundances ( Fig 2C ). These
attractors make up a small subset of the entire microbiome network state space ( S2 Table ).
The attractor landscape can be divided into six groups based on abundance patterns they
share ( S4 Fig ). Group 1 is made up of a single attractor wherein all genera are absent (OFF). The
second group attractor consists of the experimentally defined healthy state (Attractor 2) and gen-
era in the C.difficile subnetwork which can be abundant (ON) independent of the clindamycin
subnetwork. The third grouping has the clindamycin treated steady state (Attractor 7) and gen-era in the C.difficile subnetwork that can survive in the presence of the clindamycin. Group 4
contains the clindamycin plus C.difficile steady state (Attractor 12) and its subsets in which one
or both of the source nodes Mollicutes andEnterobacteriaceae are absent. Group 5 contains
attractors in which clindamycin is absent and C.difficile is present. Even if clindamycin is absent,
our model suggests that C.difficile can thrive if Lachnospiraceae andBarnesiella are absent, i.e.
these states represent a clindamycin-independent loss of Lachnospiraceae andBarnesiella . Lastly,
group 6 attractors have both clindamycin and C.difficile as OFF. Blautia andEnterococcus are
always abundant in these attractors. Indeed, because of the mutual activation between Blautia
andEnterococcus they always appear together. Attractors in this group may also include the
abundance (ON state) of the source nodes Mollicutes andEnterobacteriaceae .
Perturbation Analysis
We next explored the perturbation of genera in the gut microbiome network model. We con-
sidered the clinically relevant question of which perturbations might alter the microbiome
steady states produced by clindamycin or clindamycin+ C.difficile treatment after clindamycin
treatment was removed. Thus, we considered the clindamycin-treated steady state (Attractor 7inS3 Fig ) and the clindamycin+ C.difficile treated steady state (Attractor 12) as initial condi-
tions and assumed that clindamycin treatment was stopped. Our simulations, employing asyn-
chronous update (see Methods ), indicate that for both initial conditions, only the state of
clindamycin changes after the treatment is stopped; these steady states become Attractor 1 and
Attractor 19, respectively ( S4 Fig ). In other words, the steady states remain identical in the
absence of clindamycin. We next explored the effect of addition (overabundance; Fig 3B , left
column) and removal (knockout; Fig 3B , right column) of individual genera, simultaneously
with the stopping of clindamycin treatment, on the model predicted steady states. For the per-
turbation analysis, the model was initialized from the clindamycin treated steady state ( Fig 3B ,
top row) or the clindamycin+ C.difficile steady state ( Fig 3B , bottom row). From the clindamy-
cin treated state, addition of Lachnospiraceae or“Other ”nodes restores the healthy steady
state; however, no removal restore the healthy steady state ( Fig 3B ). From the clindamycin+ C.
difficile state, addition of Barnesiella ,Lachnospiraceae ,o r“Other ”nodes lead to a shift toward
the healthy steady state (suppression of C.difficile ).
Generating Genus-Level Metabolic Reconstructions
Species-level reconstructions from the genus Enterobacteriaceae contained the most reactions
on average (1335), while those from Mollicutes contained the least (485) ( S3 Table ). The Barne-
siella andEnterococcus reconstructions contained the most unique reactions ( S4 Table ) and,
Network Model of the Gut Microbiome

interestingly, also displayed more overlap in reaction content between each other (503 reac-
tions) than was observed between any other pair of reconstructions ( S5 Table ).Lachnospira-
ceae andBarnesiella had the next highest degree of overlap (424 reactions). Mollicutes and
Coprobacillus had the least degree of overlap (363 reactions) ( S5 Table ). Note that the meta-
bolic reconstructions produced by the SEED framework are draft quality, and as such, may
lack the predictive power of well-curated metabolic reconstructions.
Subsystem Enrichment Analysis
Enrichment analysis was performed for the 99 unique subsystem annotations that were observed
in the community. 22 subsystems displayed interesting enrichment patterns with respect to the
structure of the interaction network ( Fig 4 ). The subsystems for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and
nucleotide sugars metabolism are enriched in all taxa, highlighting the fact that all taxa contain

relatively full complements of reactions within those subsystems. Interestingly, C.difficile is
highly enriched for reactions in cyanamino acid metabolism compared to all other genera.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis and cyanoamino acid metabolism subsystems are differ-
entially enriched between C.difficile and both Barnesiella andLachnospiraceae . Between Barne-
siella andEnterococcus ,Barnesiella is more highly enriched for d-glutamine and d-glutamate
metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, LPS biosynthesis. With respect to Enterococ-
cus,Barnesiella is less highly enriched in pyrimidine metabolism, and phenylalanine, tyrosine,
and tryptophan biosynthesis.
Fig 4. Subsystem enrichment analysis highlights metabolic differences between taxa. The p-values from the enrichment analysis are log-transformed
and negated, such that darker regions indicate greater enrichment. The enrichment analysis quantifies the likelihood that a given subsystem (row) w ould be
as highly abundant as observed within a given metabolic reconstruction (column) by chance alone. A subset of 22 interesting subsystems is shown here.
Subsystems of interest include those for which all taxa are enriched, such as glycolysis, and nucleotide sugars metabolism, highlighting the fact th at all taxa
contain relatively full compliments of reactions within those subsystems. Similarly, subsystems for which a single genus differs from the remainin g genera are
interesting, such as cyanoamino acid metabolism, where C.difficile is highly enriched for reactions in that subsystem. Some subsystems are differentially
enriched between Barnesiella and Lachnospiraceae , and C.difficile such as lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and cyanoamino acid metabolism.

Generating Metabolic Competition and Mutualism Scores
The metabolic reconstructions were used to explore the potential metabolic underpinnings of
the inferred interaction network. Competition scores were generated for all pairwise relation-
ships between the genera considered in the model (self-edges were excluded). The two Lachnos-
piraceae genera were treated as metabolically identical, and the “Other ”group was excluded. We
grouped pairs of genera into five groups based on being connected by a positive or negative edge,
a negative or positive path (meaning an indirect relationship), or no path. A positive relationshipwas found between competition score and edge type in the interaction network (i.e. positive
edges tend to have a higher competition score), which was not statistically significant, perhaps
due to the small sample size (p-value = 0.058 by one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test) ( S5A Fig ).
The mutualism score did not display any obvious trends with respect to the network structure(S5B Fig ). All pairs with inferred edges exhibited relatively high competition scores and low
mutualism scores ( S5C Fig ).Barnesiella , a key inhibitor of C.difficile in the interaction network,
holds the second smallest competition score with C.difficile (seeFig 5A ).Barnesiella andC.diffi-
cilealso have the highest mutualism score among all interacting pairs in the network ( S5C Fig ).
The positive relationship between edge type and competition score suggests that more meta-
bolic similarity between genera tends to foster positive interaction. The converse is also true,where less metabolic similarity tends to foster negative interactions ( S5A Fig ). Here, “positive/
negative interaction ”is derived from the Boolean model, where a positive edge between species
A and B indicates that if A is ON at time t, then B is likely to turn ON at t+1.
Co-culture and Spent Media Experiments
Barnesiella intestinihominis was chosen as a representative species for the genus Barnesiella for the
in vitro experiments. C.difficile grew more slowly in B.intestinihominis spent media (n = 16, p-
value<0.005, by one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test) ( Fig 5B ). The co-culture with both B.intesti-
nihominis andC.difficile grew more slowly than C.difficile alone (n = 16, p-value <0.05, by one-
sided Wilcoxon rank sum test) ( Fig 5B ).C.difficile area under the growth curve (AUC), a measure
of the achieved bacterial density over the experime nt, was not statistically different between growth
in fresh media and B.intestinihominis spent media (n = 16, p-value = 0.22 by one-sided Wilcoxon
rank sum test). However, the co-culture displa yed a much lower AUC than expected under a null
model of interaction (in which the two species do not interact) ( Fig 5C ). Examining the co-culture
growth curve, it maintained a consist e n t l yl o w e rd e n s i t yt h a nan u l lm o d e l( Fig 5D ).
Discussion
Here we have developed a novel strategy for generating a dynamic model of gut microbiota com-
position by inferring relationships from time series metagenomic data ( Fig 1 ). To our knowledge,
this is the first Boolean dynamic model of a microbial interaction network and the first Boolean
model inferred from metagenomic sequence information. Metagenomic sequencing is a power-ful tool that tells us the consequences of microbial interaction —changes in bacterial abundance.
Bacterial interactions are, in fact, mediated by the many chemicals and metabolites the bacteria
use and produce. In a network sense these relationships are a bipartite graph; bacterial generaproduce chemicals/metabolites, which have an effect on other bacteria. Because there is no com-prehensive source for the bacterial metabolites and their effect on other bacterial genera, we infer
the effects of genera on each other from the relative abundances of genera in a set of microbiome
samples, and we employ genome-scale metabolic reconstructions to gain insight into these rela-tionships ( Fig 6B ). Binarization of the microbial abundances clarifies these relationships and is
the starting point for the construction of a dynamic network model of the gut microbiome. Inter-
estingly, principal component analysis demonstrates that the time series data clusters by

experimental treatment group, suggesting that our initial assumption of binary relationships
does not lead to significant information loss ( Fig 2A and 2B ).

We analyze the topological and dynamic nature of the gut microbiome, focusing on the
effect of clindamycin antibiotic and C.difficile infection on gut microbial community structure.
We generate a microbial interaction network and dynamic model based on time-series data
from a population of mice. We validate a key edge in this interaction network between Barne-
siella andC.difficile through an in vitro experiment. Consistent with the literature, our model
affirms that solely inoculating a healthy microbiome with C.difficile is insufficient to disrupt
the healthy intestinal tract microbiome. Additionally, our results demonstrate that clindamycin
treatment has a tremendous effect on the microbiome, greatly reducing many microbial genera,and that during the time C.difficile is present, a certain subset of bacteria come to dominate the
microbiome ( S1andS2and2CFigs).
Our dynamic network model reveals the steady state conditions attainable by this microbial
system, how those steady states are reached and maintained, how they relate to the health or
disease status of the mice, and how targeted changes in the network can transition the
Fig 6. Computational models can bring us closer to true interaction networks. A) Potential inhibitory mechanisms include direct inhibition of C.difficile
byBarnesiella (e.g. via competition for scarce resources, or toxin production), or indirect inhibition (e.g. through a host antimicrobial response). B) A great
deal has been published on the topic of network inference from complex data sets, and more can be done to improve inference methods. Particularly for
microbial interaction networks, it is essential to identify, not only the nature of the interactions, but also the underlying mechanisms. Metagenom ic genus
abundance information can be used to infer causal relationships between bacteria; however, other information sources are required to determine the exact
nature of these interactions. Each individual network edge may have very different underlying causes (metabolic, physical interaction, toxin-bas ed, etc.).
Including more tools in the pipeline, such as metabolic network reconstructions, bioinformatics tools, etc., will help elucidate these mechanisms , allowing far
more rapid hypothesis generation, leading to a more focused effort in the wet lab.

community from a disease state to a healthy state. Furthermore, we examine genome-scale
metabolic network reconstructions of the taxa represented in this community, examine broad
metabolic differences between the taxa in the community, and probe how metabolism could —
and could not —contribute to the mechanistic underpinnings of the observed interactions.
Network Structure
The first feature that stands out in the inferred interaction network is its clustered structure.
Clindamycin has a strong influence on the subnetwork containing the two Lachnospiraceae
nodes and Barnesiella . The other subnetwork contains C.difficile and other genera that become
abundant during C.difficile infection ( Fig 2D ). Also worth noticing are the two contradicting
edges in the network, between Coprobacillus andBlautia , and the self-edges for Blautia (Fig
2D). These arise from rules in the Boolean model that are context-dependent. Such context-
dependent rules can manifest as opposite edge types, depending on the state of other nodes inthe network. Context-dependent interactions have been demonstrated in many microbial pair-
ings, and nutritional environments can even be designed to induce specific interaction types
[58]. It is possible that subtle environmental changes over the course of the experiment altered
conditions in a way that flipped the Coprobacillus -Blautia interaction. Because the interaction
network is derived from time-series data, it is possible to estimate causality, and therefore,
derive a directed graph. A directed network with clear, causative interactions can be used tostudy community dynamics. This is in contrast with association networks, which are often
derived from independent samples, and cannot determine direction of causality [ 48,59–61].
Such networks are more limited in utility because they cannot be used to predict system behav-ior over time, or system responses to perturbations [ 24,62]. Note that the inferred network
structure represents a set of hypotheses as to potential interactions among genera. Determining
whether or not the interactions truly occur requires further experimentation, similar to the
experimentation completed to validate the edge between Barnesiella andC.difficile .
Experimental Validation of Barnesiella Inhibition of C.difficile
We experimentally validated a key edge in the interaction network, and showed that Barnesiella
can in fact slow C.difficile growth. C.difficile was grown alone, in co-culture with B.intestini-
hominis , and in B.intestinihominis spentmedia. C.difficile grew more slowly in both co-culture
and spent-media conditions. Though moderate, the effect was statistically significant ( Fig 5B ).
The fact that C.difficile growth rate was inhibited under spent-media conditions indicates that
B.intestinihominis -mediated inhibition does not require B.intestinihominis to“sense ”the
presence of C.difficile . Further, C.difficile growth on B.intestinihominis spent media demon-
strates that the two species have different nutrient requirements. Whether the reduction in
growth rate is a result of nutritional limitations ( e.g.C.difficile resorts to a less preferred carbon
source) is unknown, but unlikely given the AUC data.
The AUC —a summation of the OD over the entire time course —is a measure of the total
bacterial density achieved over the course of the experiment. It can be thought of as a single
metric combining growth rate and biomass production over time. Examining the AUC for allconditions showed that C.difficile AUC did not significantly change between fresh media and
spent media ( Fig 5C ). Thus, C.difficile was able to produce comparable overall biomass despite
a reduction in growth rate, further demonstrating that nutrient availability was sufficient in the
spent media condition. The AUC for the co-culture was much lower than expected in a simu-lated null model ( Fig 5C ). Apparently, in co-culture, the total community biomass production
capacity is reduced from what would be expected in a scenario without species interaction.
Thus, there is a measurable negative interaction between B.intestinihominis andC.difficile in

co-culture that impacts biomass production. This can be observed over the full time-course of
the co-culture, where the overall density is consistently lower than what would be expected in a
null model ( Fig 5D ).
Network Dynamics and Perturbation Analysis
Computational perturbation analysis showed that forced overabundance of Barnesiella led to a
shift from the “disease ”state (clindamycin+ C.difficile treatment group) to a state highly simi-
lar to the original healthy state (loss of C.difficile) . This result is particularly interesting from a
therapeutic design standpoint. In this case, the model results indicate that Barnesiella may
serve as an effective probiotic. Model-driven analysis can be used to identify candidate organ-
isms for probiotic treatments. Recent work by Buffie et al. performed a proof-of-concept study
in which they used statistical models to identify candidate probiotic organisms, which werethen tested on a murine model of C.difficile infection [ 54]. This model-driven approach can be
favorably contrasted with the brute-force experimental approach in which successive combina-
tions of microbes are tested until a curative set is found [ 56]. The model-driven approach
requires far fewer experiments, and saves time and resources. While the computational model
presented here differs from that used by Buffie et al., the integration of computational models
in probiotic design has been shown to be a feasible, effective approach. Improved tools, such asthe perturbation analysis presented here, will surely accelerate the probiotic design process andshorten the path to the clinic.
Metabolic Competition Scores Point towards a Non-metabolic
Interaction Mechanism
Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions can be used to estimate the interactions
between microbes in a complex community based purely on genome sequence data. Our use ofgenus-level metabolic network reconstructions (a union of several species-level reconstruc-
tions) may not reflect the unique, species-level interactions and heterogeneity within a commu-
nity. This higher-level model will only capture broad trends and the possible extent ofmetabolic capacity within a genus. Furthermore, the draft status of these models precludes theeffective application of flux balance analysis (FBA) to estimate interactions among genera. This
is due to the established lack of precision in draft reconstructions in predictions of growth rates
and substrate utilization patterns [ 63], and the sensitivity of interaction models to metabolic
environment and model structure [ 58,64]. Future efforts to infer metabolic interactions using
FBA and well-curated metabolic networks could provide deeper insights into specific metabo-
lites that are shared (or competed for) between specific microbial pairs.
The application of competition scores demonstrated here ( S5A Fig ) could potentially be
used to quickly establish a rough expectation (notice the spread of competition scores for the
species pairs not connected by a path through the network) for community structure —based
solely on genomic information —that can then be tested experimentally. Interestingly, the fact
that higher competition score is associated with more positive interactions inferred from the
Boolean model relates to previous work that demonstrates that higher competition scores wereassociated with habitat co-occurrence [ 46]. In this same work, the authors suggest that this
effect is due to habitat filtering; that is, microbes with similar metabolic capabilities tend to
thrive in similar environments. It has been shown experimentally that microorganisms from
the same environment tend to lose net productivity in batch co-culture, indicating similar met-abolic requirements [ 65]. Thus, it appears that metabolically similar organisms tend to co-
locate to similar niches, and over evolutionary time, co-localized organisms tend to develop
positive relationships with each other.

Understanding this relationship between competition score and interaction type leads to the
conclusion that negative interactions are probably not caused by metabolic competition. Of all
the genus competition scores with C.difficile ,Barnesiella showed the second lowest ( Fig 5A ). In
other words, Barnesiella is among the least likely to share a similar metabolic niche with C.diffi-
cile, which fits with the broad trend mentioned above. The fact that the competition score
between C.difficile andBarnesiella is so low strongly suggests that the negative interaction
between them is due, not to competition for scarce resources (although it does not completelyexclude the possibility), but rather to some non-metabolic mechanism. The similarity in reaction
content between Barnesiella andEnterococcus indicates similar network structure ( S5 Table ),
and yet, Enterococcus does not inhibit C.difficile in the inferred interaction network ( Fig 2D ).
Either the differences that are present between Barnesiella (65 unique reactions) and Enterococ-
cus(36 unique reactions) are hints at the mechanism of interaction, or metabolism does not play
a significant role in C.difficile inhibition in the environment of the gut. For example, enrichment
analysis showed that that, with respect to Enterococcus ,Barnesiella is more highly enriched for
d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis and LPS biosyn-
thesis. With respect to Enterococcus ,Barnesiella is less enriched in pyrimidine metabolism, and
phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. The possible role of LPS is discussed fur-ther on. The possible roles of these other metabolic pathways in C.difficile inhibition is unclear.
There is experimental evidence that Barnesiella (and other normal flora) may combat path-
ogen overgrowth through non-metabolic mechanisms. As a first step, it has been shown thatVRE can grow in sterile murine cecal contents —indicating the presence of sufficient nutrition
to support VRE —but is inhibited in saline-treated cecal contents —indicating that live flora are
needed to suppress VRE growth, and that this suppression is not through nutrient sequestra-tion [ 66]. Further, the presence of B.intestinihominis has been demonstrated to prevent and
cure VRE infection in mice [ 55], and is strongly correlated with resistance to C.difficile infec-
tion in mice [ 54]. Clearly, Barnesiella plays a key role in pathogen inhibition, and pathogen
inhibition can be caused by mechanisms other than nutrient competition.
This non-metabolic mechanism may be direct or indirect ( Fig 6A ). We demonstrated in
vitro thatB.intestinihominis can inhibit C.difficile growth rate ( Fig 5C and 5D ). The fact that
C.difficile grows on B.intestinihominis spent media at all indicates that the metabolic require-
ments of the two species are different, which is consistent with our computational results sup-
porting the hypothesis that C.difficile andBarnesiella do not compete metabolically ( Fig 5B ).
Further, C.difficile is moderately inhibited both in co-culture with B.intestinihominis and in B.
intestinihominis -spent media, indicating a direct mechanism of inhibition. In further support
of a direct mechanism, it has been shown that Clostridium scindens inhibits growth of C.diffi-
cilethrough the production of secondary bile acids [ 54]. Perhaps Barnesiella works through an
analogous mechanism in vivo , enhancing the moderate inhibition observed in vitro .
In support of an additional indirect mechanism of bacterial interaction, Buffie and Pamer,
in a recent review, hypothesized that the normal flora (of which Barnesiella is a member) may
prevent pathogen overgrowth by stimulation of a host antimicrobial response [ 67](Fig 6A ).
Specifically, they point out that Barnesiella can activate host toll-like receptor TLR signaling,
which activates host antimicrobial peptide production. For example, LPS and flagellin have
been shown to stimulate the host innate immune response through toll-like receptor (TLR) sig-naling and production of bactericidal lectins [ 68,69].Barnesiella shows enrichment for LPS
biosynthesis pathways ( Fig 4 ). However, this mechanism did not seem to be responsible for
inhibition of VRE by Barnesiella [55]. An indirect, host-mediated mechanism is further sup-
ported by the fact that members of the normal gut flora can interact differently with pathogens
depending on the host organism [ 54]. Regardless, any indirect mechanism is in addition to the
direct inhibitory mechanism observed in vitro . Both direct and indirect mechanisms may play
Network Model of the Gut Microbiome

a role in vivo , and further work is needed to clearly discern the underlying process that allows
Barnesiella to play this protective role.
We demonstrate that dynamic Boolean models capture key microbial interactions and
dynamics from time-series abundance data in a murine microbiome. We show that thiscomputational approach enables exhaustive in silico perturbation, which leads to fast candidate
selection for probiotic design. We further describe the use of genome-scale metabolic network
reconstructions to explore the metabolic potential attributed to community members, and toestimate metabolic competition and cooperation between members of the microbiome com-
munity. Analysis of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions indicates that Barnesiella
likely inhibits C.difficile through some non-metabolic mechanism. We present empirical in
vitro evidence that B.intestinihominis does in fact inhibit C.difficile growth, likely by a non-
metabolic mechanism, and our findings are in good agreement with published results. We
present this work as a demonstration of the use of dynamic Boolean models and genome-scalemetabolic reconstructions to explore the structure, dynamics, and mechanistic underpinnings
of complex microbial communities.

Abstract
Two types of distinct cardiac progenitor cell populations can be identified during early heart development: the first heart
field (FHF) and second heart field (SHF) lineage that later form the mature heart. They can be characterized by differential
expression of transcription and signaling factors. These regulatory factors influence each other forming a gene regulatory
network. Here, we present a core gene regulatory network for early cardiac development based on published temporal andspatial expression data of genes and their interactions. This gene regulatory network was implemented in a Booleancomputational model. Simulations reveal stable states within the network model, which correspond to the regulatory states
of the FHF and the SHF lineages. Furthermore, we are able to reproduce the expected temporal expression patterns of early
cardiac factors mimicking developmental progression. Additionally, simulations of knock-down experiments within ourmodel resemble published phenotypes of mutant mice. Consequently, this gene regulatory network retraces the early stepsand requirements of cardiogenic mesoderm determination in a way appropriate to enhance the understanding of heart
development.

Introduction
The heart is the first functional organ to develop in mammals.
After the end of gastrulation, cardiogenic progenitor cells
constitute the cardiac crescent in the anterior mesoderm of the
murine embryo. At this stage the cardiogenic mesoderm splits
from a common cardiovascular progenitor cell population [1,2]
into two areas of differential gene expression: the so-called first
heart field (FHF) and the second heart field (SHF). Cells of theFHF build the primary heart tube and later mainly contribute to
the left ventricle, most of the atria and provide a minority of cells
of the right ventricle. Cells of the SHF mainly contribute to the
right ventricle, the outflow tract and the atria [3,4].
Underlying regulatory factors control these differentiation
processes. The induction of mesoderm depends on canonical
Wnt signaling [5]. After mesoderm formation cardiogenic
precursor cells are characterized by the expression of the
transcription factor Mesp1 [6]. Endodermal signals such as
Bmp2 were also described as being crucial for cardiogenesis
[7,8,9]. These signals activate a variety of transcription factors of
the cardiogenic mesoderm like Nkx2.5 or GATA factors [7,8,10].
Some of the cardiac transcription factors can be assigned to one ofthe two heart fields. The transcription factors Isl1, Foxc1/2, Tbx1
and the ligand Fgf8 determine the area of the SHF, while the
transcription factor Tbx5 is only expressed in the FHF[11,12,13,14]. It is thought that intrinsic wiring among these
cardiac factors determines the progression of cardiac differentia-tion and the division into subdomains of differential geneexpression. Heart development can severely be impaired in casea regulatory factor of cardiogenesis is missing. Several studiesanalyzed specific interactions within gene regulation of earlymammalian heart development using knock out or knock downapproaches of individual factors. A deeper understanding of thecardiac gene regulatory network requires the implementation ofthis network as a computational model and its subsequent analysisby computational simulations.
Expression of a gene is regulated by input signals given by
transcription factors binding to the regulatory region of the
gene. The strength of transcription, e.g. the amount of primarytranscript, can be depicted as a function depending on theconcentration of these regulatory transcription factors. Thisfunction often follows a sigmoidal behaviour, which is governedby cooperativity in a first stage and controlled by saturation atlater stages resulting in a switch-like behavior. This propertyensures defined levels of gene expression for a wide range ofconcentration levels. This sigmoidal function of gene expressioncan be approximated as a step function [15]. A commonapproximation of the possible states of a gene is therefore toconsider a gene to be active or inactive [15]. These two states
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46798
of a gene correspond to a present and to an absent gene
product and can be encoded as Boolean logical values: true (1)and false (0). Dependencies between genes, e.g. whether a
transcription factor acts as a transcriptional activator, repressor
or both, can then be captured by Boolean functions which map
the state of a gene regulatory network to a succeeding state.
These functions allow a Boolean model to exhibit dynamicalbehavior in simulations. Boolean logic network models have
been used to model e.g. endomesodermal territories in the sea
urchin [16], the hrp regulon of Pseudomonas syringae [17], and the
bistable lac operon in E. coli [18]. Every Boolean model has a
finite number of states, as the state of each gene is representedby one of two possible values. For k genes this results in 2
k
possible state combinations. It follows, that starting a simulationfrom an initial state and following synchronous state transitions
according to the Boolean functions, the model eventually ends
up in recurring states, a cycle. A degenerated cycle may consistof a single Boolean state. These recurring states are called
attractors. They can correspond to observed expression profiles
or phenotypes in gene regulatory networks [19,20,21].
We here introduce a Boolean model for the early cardiac gene
regulatory network of the mouse, containing known core genes
required for cardiac development and FHF/SHF determination.
The model is based on published temporal and spatial expressionpatterns of relevant transcription factors and growth factors and
includes known regulatory interactions taking into account
whether a transcription factor acts as an activator or repressor
on a given target gene. We are able to show that this
computational model is able to reproduce different states observedduring cardiac development. Model simulations demonstrate that
stable states of gene expression representing either the FHF or the
SHF are encoded within the wiring of gene interactions. Thereby,we provide an insight into the functional properties of the cardiac
gene regulatory network. This will be an important basis for
further enlargements of the network and for in-silico predictions of
genetic interactions.
Results
A Gene Regulatory Network for Early Murine
Cardiogenesis
For constructing a gene regulatory network of early cardiac
development we collected published data. An overview of cardiac
genes and their interactions is provided in Figure 1 and Table S1.
The expression of genes and their interactions take place in atemporal and spatial frame, as marked by colored boxes in
Figure 1. The network is characterized by early signaling events
during gastrulation resulting in cardiac specification and subse-quent signaling activities at the cardiac crescent stage which
separate the cardiac progenitor cell population into the territories
of the FHF and the SHF lineages. Furthermore, signaling from the
endoderm was also included into our model.
Early canonical Wnt signaling is required for the activation of
the pan-mesodermal transcription factor Brachyury [5,22] and for
the cardiac specific expression of the transcription factor Mesp1[10]. Mesp1 subsequently activates various cardiac factors,
initiating the cardiac crescent stage. Mesp1 upregulates the
expression of genes of both heart fields, e.g. Nkx2.5, GATA4,
Tbx1 and Tbx5 [8,10]. At the same time, Mesp1 inhibits expression
of genes of other developmental fates (not included into themodel), e.g. endodermal genes and the mesodermal gene Brachyury
which later supports posterior mesoderm formation and axial
development [10,23,24]. In the FHF, cardiac transcription factors
like Nkx2.5, GATAs and Tbx5 build an intertwined positivefeedback circuit to stabilize their expression. They activate
downstream regulatory genes like Hand genes or myocardin . Finally,
regulatory factors upregulate a set of differentiation genes. Genesbeing specific for terminal differentiation such as myosin light chain
genes (MLC) ormyosin heavy chain genes (MHC) code for structural
proteins and constitute the end of the developmental processesdescribed by the regulatory network (Figure 1, FHF area).Similarly, a network of molecular interactions exists in the SHF(Figure 1, SHF area). Furthermore, the endoderm has been shownto influence cardiogenesis, especially by the signaling factors Bmp2and Dkk1. In addition, in the heart looping stage the regulatoryfactors Isl1, Tbx1 and Fgf8 are also expressed in the pharyngealendoderm. There, Shh activates Tbx1 through the Forkheadtranscription factor Foxa2. Shh might also signal to the SHF andregulate gene expression during later stages [12].
A Boolean Model of the Cardiac Regulatory Network
We implemented the core cardiac genes and their interactions
(Fig. 2A) as a Boolean model. The interactions of the involvedgenes and signaling factors were gained from published data andare enlisted in detail in Table S2. The corresponding Booleanfunctions are given in Figure 2B. This computational modelrepresents the core regulatory interactions of the gene regulatorynetwork of cardiogenesis as presented in Figure 1.
As introduced, cardiac development also depends on signals
derived at particular time points of development from other tissuessuch as the endoderm and thus are not included in the corecardiac gene regulory network. Those are represented in ourmodel by four genes: exogen BMP2 I, exogen BMP2 II, exogen CanWnt
I, exogen CanWnt II . Bmp2 signaling for example from the
endoderm is important for the induction of cardiogenic mesoderm.In order to represent the required activation of Bmp2 at thecorrect time point, the cardiac progenitor cell state, we modeled atemporal delay by the two genes exogen BMP2 I and exogenBMP2 II. Similarly, exogen CanWnt I and exogen CanWnt II areused to activate canonical Wnt signaling at the cardiac crescentstate in the SHF. This represents the described canonical Wntsignaling in the SHF at E7.5 [25].
Expectations of the Boolean Model
Simulations of the computational Boolean model are expected
to reproduce gene expression profiles as closely as possible and inthe same temporal sequence as they appear during cardiogenesis in
vivo. Therefore, the temporal and spatial expression patterns of
genes included in the model were collected from publications(Table S3). According to the collected data, expected attractorsrepresenting the FHF and SHF as well as the expectations fortransient states were defined (Figure 3). Furthermore, as genes arestably expressed in a certain area the model should not onlyreproduce a gene expression profile, but exhibit also stability ofthese states. Thus, we expect the expression profiles of the FHFand of the SHF to be represented in attractors of the network
model.
The expected gene expression profiles for a FHF attractor and
for a SHF attractor are given in Figure 3A and Figure 3B,respectively. In the FHF the genes Bmp2 ,Nkx2.5 ,Gatas and Tbx5
are expected to be active, while genes which usually only appear inthe SHF are inactive. In the SHF canWnt ,Tbx1 ,Fgf8,Foxc1/2 ,
Gatas, Nkx2.5 and Isl1are active, while Tbx5 is expected to be
inactive. Figure 3C summarizes the initial states, transition statesand the attractors of the FHF and the SHF.Boolean Model of Cardiac Regulatory Network

The Network Model Exhibits Stable States for the FHF
and the SHF and Reproduces Temporal Development
To analyze the cardiac network, we simulated all possible initial
state combinations (215= 32768 states for all genes) with the
cardiac network model. This analysis detects all possible Booleanattractors of the Boolean model (Figure 4A). Our simulations leadto three attractors. One attractor appears only for 1% of the initialstates and contains no active cardiac genes. Another attractorappears in 49% of the cases. In this state the genes Bmp2, Tbx5,
GATA and Nkx2.5 are active, while other genes are inactive. This
attractor resembles the gene expression in FHF cells (comparewith Figure 3A) and will be called the FHF attractor from now on.An additional attractor appears for 50% of all initial states andcorresponds to the SHF gene expression state (as specified in
Figure 3B). We call this the SHF attractor. This finding indicates
that the wiring of the network determines gene expression in thefirst and second heart field.
Next, we analyzed the temporal sequence of network states
leading to the FHF and the SHF attractors. For this purpose weincluded relevant biological information to define an appropriateinitial setting of the network. At the beginning of gastrulation,canonical Wnt signaling is active and initiates the determination ofthe mesodermal and cardiac cell lineage [26]. None of the othercardiac specific genes included in our network are active at thattime. Therefore, we defined an initial state in which only canonicalWnt signaling is active for further simulations with our networkmodel (compare expectation for the initial state in Figure 3C).Furthermore, both heart fields are induced by endodermal Bmpsignaling after the induction of mesoderm. We modeled this by theexternal signals exogen BMP2 I and exogen BMP2 II which
initiate Bmp signaling at the appropriate time point.
The initial state with active cardiac canWnt and exogen
(endodermal) BMP2 leads to a FHF attractor (Figure 4B, leftpanel). After gastrulation, the SHF receives additional canonicalWnt signaling while the FHF is unaffected. Therefore, weadditionally specified this external signal by exogen CanWnt I
and II for the setup which re-activates canonical Wnt signaling atthe cardiac crescent state. The initial state with active canWnt,
exogen BMP2 and exogen CanWnt leads to a SHF attractor
(Figure 4B, right panel).
Setups giving rise to both FHF and SHF contain an initial state
with active canWnt signaling and active exogen BMP2 I. The
difference between both setups is the additional activation of
exogen CanWnt I in the setup leading to the SHF. The use ofexternal signals allows us to compare the intrinsic states of thenetwork during the simulations to a temporal developmentalprocess in the developing organism, which integrates signals fromnon-cardiac tissues.
The state transitions of the network, which occur during the
simulation, can be compared to a temporal process in thedeveloping organism. From the initial state on (marked by timepoint t = 1) we follow the state transitions towards the finalattractors for the two setups differing in exogen CanWnt I
activation (Figure 4B). There are three state transitions leading to
the FHF attractor. Following an active canonical Wnt signalingMesp1 and Dkk1 are expressed at time point t = 2. TransientMesp1 expression is described in cardiac precursor cells duringgastrulation [6,27,28]. Mesp1 activates a variety of cardiacregulatory factors [8,29]. The network state at t = 2 of thesimulation resembles the gastrulation stage in vivo (compare transit
1 in Figure 3C). Cardiac regulatory genes Nkx2.5, GATAs, Isl1 and
Tbx5 are activated at t = 3 of the simulation. Active genes of this
state resemble the expression in the common cardiovascularprogenitor cell population where Isl1, Tbx5, GATAs and Nkx2.5are present [1,2,30]. The expected expression for this state isdefined in transition state 2 in Figure 3C. After one additional
transition the FHF resembling attractor appears (Figure 4B,
without exogen CanWnt I, t = 4).
In the setup with active exogen CanWnt I, cardiac canonical
Wnt signaling is reactivated at the state of the commoncardiovascular progenitor cell (Figure 4B, with exogen CanWnt

I, t = 3). States leading to the common cardiovascular progenitors
are identical in comparison to the setup without exogen CanWnt I.Canonical Wnt signaling leads to the activation of SHF genes andthereby to the inhibition of the FHF transcription factor Tbx5.The SHF attractor is constituted at time points t = 4 and t = 5. In
summary, the tracing of state transitions in the simple Boolean
model substantiates the literature derived expectations.
To verify that canonical Wnt signaling is the signaling event that
drives cells towards a SHF fate, we eliminated the influence ofexogen CanWnt II in the model by keeping exogen CanWnt II = 0throughout the simulation. This is in line with investigations byKlaus et al. [31] and Lin et al. [25] which showed that Wnt/a ˆ-
catenin dependent transcription is upregulated at E7.5 in thesecond heart field. For both initial setups the network attains aFHF attractor, passing the same transition states as for the
wildtype without exogen canWnt (Figure 4B, left side). Itdemonstrates that in our network model cardiac canonical Wntsignaling which is induced from non cardiac tissue is sufficient toestablish the SHF attractor.
The Boolean Model Reproduces Knock-out and
Overexpression Phenotypes
For most of the genes involved in the presented cardiac network,
knock-out mice have been studied with respect to cardiacdevelopment. To analyze whether our model will produceattractors comparable to knock-out phenotypes, the correspondinggene was kept off at all time points of simulation.

Without Wnt signaling no mesoderm is formed, which is the
prerequisite for cardiogenesis [5]. For this, we set canWnt = 0,
simulating the ablation of cardiac canonical Wnt signaling
(Figure 5A). In the simulations of both setups Mesp1 is not
activated resulting in absence of cardiac mesoderm at time t = 2
and thus further cardiac factors are not activated. The predictions
of the model simulations are consistent with knock-out experi-
ments in mice, where upon ablation of canonical Wnt signaling no
mesoderm forms [5]. We also simulated overexpression of cardiac
canonical Wnt signaling by constantly activating Wnt signaling
(canWnt = 1) (Figure 5B). It is known that a sequence of different
levels of canonical Wnt signaling are required for proper heart
development [26]. In both initial setups, mesoderm is induced
upon Wnt overexpression as indicated by Mesp1 activation(Figure 5B, t = 2). In the setup without exogen canonical Wnt
signaling, some of the cardiac genes are activated after expression
of Mesp1, but no defined heart field is established, leading to an
attractor without activated cardiac genes. In contrast, starting by
the setup with non-cardiac canonical Wnt signaling, the simulation
soon reaches the SHF attractor. In our model a FHF attractor is
not formed, while the SHF attractor is reached one time step
earlier. Conditional overexpression of b-catenin (a key transducer
of canonical Wnt signaling) disrupts primary heart tube formation,
a FHF derived structure and leads to an expanded Isl1 expression
in the SHF [25,31].
The mesodermal gene Mesp1 induces the expression of many
cardiac genes. In the mouse embryo Mesp2 can compensate for
some Mesp1 functions. Since Mesp2 is not an explicit part of thenetwork model, but merely is represented by Mesp1, model
simulations switching off Mesp1 (Mesp1 = 0) resembles a double
knock-out of Mesp1 and Mesp2 in the mouse embryo [28]. These
double knock-out mutant embryos do not form cardiac mesoderm.
In our model, switching of Mesp1 leads for the setup without
exogen canonical Wnt signaling to an attractor without any
expression of cardiac genes. For the setup with exogen CanWnt
signaling, no cardiac genes are active in the appropriate time
frame when a common cardiac progenitor cell should be
established (Figure 5C, with exogen CanWnt I, t = 3). If the time
window for differentiation of the cells passes, some other fate will
be adopted. In our simulations, the network reaches the SHF
attractor after a number of further state transitions due to a lack of
genes for alternative fates and a lack of further signaling inputfrom other tissues. Since our model does not exhibit cardiac gene
expression within two time steps past the gastrulation state, it is in
accordance with the reported in vivo results.
Dkk1 has been demonstrated to induce cardiac marker genes
together with Mesp1. Without Mesp1, Dkk1 inhibits their
expression [8]. The knock-out simulation of Dkk1 in the presented
cardiac gene regulatory network model exhibited a delay of
Nkx2.5 activation by one transition state. Besides this, the
attractors and state transitions are are identical in comparison to
the undisturbed network (Figure 5D). This simulation result
demonstrates that in our model Dkk1 is not important for the
correct specification and differentiation of cardiac mesoderm into
FHF and SHF lineages. As shown in [32], Dkk1 and Dkk2 double
mutant mice have no immediate effect on heart development.

genes to be active. In (A) a state defined as FHF state with the according gene activity and in (B) the expected SHF state are presented. Colored genesare active, while gray genes are inactive. In (C) states are listed which are expected to appear during a simulation course. In the initial state of thenetwork which corresponds to early mesoderm development, only canonical Wnt signaling is expected to be present, while genes for differentiationof cardiogenic precursor cells are still inactive. A simulation of the network model is expected to pass transition steps one and two. These correspon d
to transient states of early cardiogenic mesoderm expressing Mesp1 and to the common cardiac progenitor cell population. Finally, the simulation is
expected to result in either the FHF or the SHF state. Genes which are expected to be expressed at a certain state are listed in green, and genes whichshould not appear in a state are shown red.

Later, these double mutant mice exhibit defects in proliferation
and hypertrophy in the heart. These defects affect the heart laterthan it is displayed in our network model and may result from alater impact of Dkks on heart development. Furthermore, genesregulating proliferation are not integrated into the network modeland can not be detected in our simulations.

In the presented model of the cardiac gene regulatory network
we collected and integrated knowledge about major regulatoryfactors required for heart development and their interactions. Theconstruction of a Boolean model of the cardiac regulatory networkallowed us to show that the interactions within the network lead tostable regulatory states representing the FHF and SHF lineages atE7.5 of murine development and indicates a robustness within thenetwork wiring.

All runs resulted in one of the three attractors shown. 49% of the simulations resulted in an attractor for the FHF (indicated in purple), 50% in anattractor mimicking the SHF state (indicated in blue) and 1% of the simulations yield an attractor without activation of core cardiac genes.

expressions and end in the attractors for FHF and SHF lineages.

The Boolean Model Describes Early Cardiac Development
We show that the computational model presented here is
sufficient to describe basic regulations of early heart developmentin mice. Simulations of this model reproduce temporal behavior ofheart developmental processes reflecting important stages as thecanonical Wnt expression phases [26], a common cardiacprogenitor cell stage [1,2] and the FHF and SHF phenotypes[3]. The model furthermore predicts the behaviour of the networkupon particular disturbance. Switching off initial canonical Wntsignaling for example (Figure 5A; Wnt = 0) leads into a ’’no heartfield‘‘ attractor. This simulation result is consistent with thecomplete ablation of b-catenin in mice, when mesoderm is not
formed [5]. Moreover, the transcription factor Mesp1 markscardiac progenitor cells. Upon switching off Mesp1 in our model,either no heart field is developed or after activation of somecardiac factors and six state transitions a SHF phenotype isreached. After gastrulation, at about t = 3 or t = 4 cardiac genesare not expressed in the simulation. At this stage usually a cardiac
fate is established. As Mesp1 expression, which is required for
cardiogenic induction, is not present and further network wiringwhich could direct the network towards another attractor were notincluded in the network the simulation ends in a SHF attractor.Nevertheless, these results indicate that cardiac formation isimpaired upon Mesp1 ablation. This corresponds to the findingthat Mesp1 ablation in mouse leads to severe defects of theformation of cardiogenic mesoderm. Upon ablation of Mesp1 andMesp2 no cardiac mesoderm is detected at all [27,28]. Further-more, Dkk1 knock-out in our network model revealed no defect indifferentiation towards FHF and SHF fates and has barely animpact on the activation of other cardiac factors. This iscomparable to Dkk1/Dkk2 double mutant mice, which do notshow defects in heart fate decision at the early stages ofdevelopment which the presented cardiac gene regulatory networkmodel covers [32]. Therefore, known in-vivo knock-out experi-ments can be reproduced with the here presented mathematicalnetwork model.
The stable state of the FHF is an example of intertwined
positive feedback regulation, as the factors involved activateeach other `s expression. The stabilization of the SHF is less
clear. In our computational model, it is mediated by canonicalWnt signaling. Canonical Wnt signaling has been shown to actin the SHF from E7.5 [25]. A conditionally ablated b-catenin (a
mediator of canonical Wnt signaling) mutant mouse leads toshortened SHF derived right ventricle and outflow tract.Furthermore, SHF specific gene expression, especially Isl1, isdiminished in the outflow tract and in the splanchnic mesoderm[25,31]. Analyses of a Mesp1-induced gain-of-function mutantofb-catenin [31] shows that the formation of the linear heart
tube (usually promoted by FHF cells) was disrupted and theexpression of Isl1 was expanded. This observation is inagreement with the overexpression study in our Boolean model(Figure 5B; Wnt = 1) which lacks the formation of a FHF state.Together, these results indicate that canonical Wnt signaling is amajor regulator of SHF identity.Wiring within the Network Results in Robustness
Our analyses demonstrate an important property of the network
wiring: robustness. Robustness ensures that aberrations in thetemporal appearance or in amounts of transcription factorexpression between cells do not alter the cell’s next stableregulatory state.
Our simulations show that there are stable states of the network,
which resemble the gene expression patterns of the FHF and SHF,respectively. This analysis investigated all possible initial states andall transitions towards the attractors. The simulation of all possibleinitial states has limited biological relevance, because most of theseinitial states will not appear in a mouse embryo in vivo .
Nevertheless, the experiment shows that these attractors are anintrinsic property of the Boolean network. The results can serve asa measure of the stability against random fluctuations in geneexpression. Thus, most possible aberrations in states will eventuallylead to a FHF or SHF attractor through a self-stabilizingmechanism contained in the wiring of the Boolean network.
Afterwards, for the progression of differentiation to a succeeding
stable regulatory state this robustness needs to be overruled e.g. by asignalfromexternaltissue.Thissignalcanbetransmittedbysignalingligands for example. The cardiac network model e.g. containscanonical Wnt signaling starting tosignal from non-cardiac tissue in adefined time frame. This signal affects the target cells to arrive at astable state, resembling the SHF. This state is only stable as long ascanonical Wnt signaling is present. If the canonical Wnt signaldiscontinues, differentiation is directed to some other stableregulatory state. Thus, robustness of a stable regulatory state isrequired within the network, but also needs to be disabled by definedsignals in order to assure directed development.
Suitability of the Choosen Model to Simulate Cardiac
Development
Commonly, time dependent processes are modeled with
differential equations, which relate the change of a compound toits value. These models describe networks of genes and require theknowledge of concentrations for each involved species and kineticrates for each specified interaction [33,34,35]. Changes in timeand space further require additional parameters and can bemodeled using partial differential equations [36,37] or stochasticapproaches for low molecule numbers [38]. Differential equationsand stochastic approaches can accurately represent biological
systems if the quantitative data is available, which is rarely the case
for large systems [39]. In contrast, many approaches for modelinggene regulatory networks are based on Boolean networks. Booleanmodels were used for describing the cell cycle [40] or regulation ofsegment polarity genes in Drosophila melanogaster [41]. Evensmall Boolean networks with only a few genes show dynamicbehavior, which resembles experiments [42]. Another example fora Boolean representation is the lac operon [18]. It demonstratesactivation and repression of gene transcription with bistability byBoolean logic. These examples for Boolean models of generegulatory networks allow for a qualitative investigation and aresuitable for the analysis of larger networks [43,44].Figure 5. Knock-down or overexpression simulations of canonical Wnt signaling, Mesp1 and Dkk1. For knock-down or overexpression a
gene is set to 0 or 1, respectively, throughout the simulation. Apart from that, the simulation is performed as in Figure 4B, starting from the definedinitial state and receiving signals as in the setup without non-cardiac canonical Wnt signaling or as in the setup with non-cardiac canonical Wnt
signaling. (A) Canonical Wnt signaling is switched off (canWnt = 0). This leads in both setups to attractors lacking active cardiac genes. (B) Upon
canonical Wnt overexpression (canWnt = 1), no FHF but a SHF forms. (C) If Mesp1 is switched off (Mesp1 = 0), no FHF builds. In the SHF setup, majorcardiac regulator genes are inactive after three state transitions. (D) Upon Dkk1 knock-out, attractors and transitions states stay the same. Activ ation
of Nkx2.5 is delayed by one step compared to the undisturbed simulation.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0046798.g005Boolean Model of Cardiac Regulatory Network

Abstract
Background: In breast cancer, overexpression of the transmembrane tyrosine kinase ERBB2 is an adverse prognostic
marker, and occurs in almost 30% of the patients. For th erapeutic intervention, ERBB2 is targeted by monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab in ad juvant settings; however, de novo resistance to this antibody is still a serious issue, requiring
the identification of additional target s to overcome resistance. In this st udy, we have combined computational
simulations, experimental testing of simulation results, an d finally reverse engineering of  a protein interaction network
to define potential ther apeutic strategies for de novo trastuzumab resistant breast cancer.
Results: First, we employed Boolean logic to model regulatory interactions an d simulated single and multiple protein
loss-of-functions. Then, our simulation results were tested  experimentally by producing single and double knockdowns
of the network components and measuring their effects on G1/S  transition during cell cycl e progression. Combinatorial
targeting of ERBB2 and EGFR did not af fect the response to trastuzumab in de novo resistant cells, which might be due
to decoupling of receptor activation an d cell cycle progression. Furthermore, ex amination of c-MYC in resistant as well
as in sensitive cell lines, using a specific chemical inhibi tor of c-MYC (alone or in co mbination with trastuzumab),
demonstrated that both trastuzu mab sensitive and resistant cells responded to c-MYC perturbation.
Conclusion: In this study, we connected ERBB signalin g with G1/S transiti on of the cell cycle via two major cell signaling
pathways and two key transcript ion factors, to model an interaction network th at allows for the identification of novel
targets in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant breast cancer . Applying this new strategy, we found that, in contrast to
trastuzumab sensitive breast cancer cell s, combinatorial targeting of ERBB rece ptors or of key signaling intermediates
does not have potential for treatment of de novo trastuzumab resistant cells. Instead,  c-MYC was identified as a novel
potential target protein in breast cancer cells.Published: 1 January 2009

Background
Anticancer drugs which are in clinical use show their effect
by acting as non-selective anti-proliferative agents whichkill also the proliferating normal cells in the tumor micro-environment [1]. The past few decades witnessed thedevelopment of targeted therapies including monoclonalantibodies, which aim at targeting certain antigens
expressed on the surface of cancer cells with high specifi-
city. In particular, adding trastuzumab, a recombinanthumanized monoclonal antibody directed against theectodomain of the receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB2, to reg-imens containing existing chemotherapeutic agents hassignificantly improved clinical outcomes for breast cancer
patients. However, de novo and acquired resistance to tar-
geted therapeutics are common and the next challengesfor the contemporary cancer researchers [2].
The ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is composed
of four receptors that have the ability to form homo- andheterodimers, and couple binding of extracellular growth
factors to intracellular signal transduction pathways [3,4].
ERBB2, the main player of the ERBB network, does notshow any ligand binding activity, but has high dimeriza-tion affinity [5,6]. The abnormal activation of ERBB recep-tors through gene amplification, mutations, or proteinoverexpression has been linked to breast cancer prognosis
[7]. Trastuzumab is administrated to ERBB2-overexpress-
ing breast cancer patients [8,9]. The drug shows its effectby inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity(ADCC), disrupting the downstream signaling of ERBB2and also resulting in G1/S cell cycle arrest [10]. However,the response rate to trastuzumab is rather low, with a
range from 12% to 34% having been reported for a
median duration of 9 months [11,12]. Hence, at least twothird of the patients are de novo resistant. On the cellular
level, this might be caused by cancer cells being able toovercome cell cycle arrest despite targeting the ERBB2receptor. Therefore, additional targets have to be identi-
fied, which should avoid bypass of cell cycle arrest mech-
anisms.
The cell cycle of eukaryotic organisms is tightly regulated
by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their activa-tion partners, cyclins [13], which lead cells through thewell-ordered G1-, S-, G2-, and M-phases. It has been
shown that ERBB2 regulates G1/S transition during cell
cycle progression by modulating the activity of the CyclinD, Cyclin E/CDK complex, the c-MYC oncogene, and thep27 kinase inhibitor [7,14]. The restriction points withindifferent cell cycle phases represent key checkpoints,where the critical decisions are made for the cells to
divide. At the G1/S restriction point of the cell cycle, cells
are committed to enter S phase where DNA replicationtakes place [15]. This process is regulated by Cyclin D/CDK4/6 and Cyclin E/CDK2 complexes, which phospho-rylate and thereby inactivate tumor suppressor retinoblas-
toma protein pRB [16-18]. Hyperphosphorylation of pRB
results in the release of the E2F transcription factor thatthen initiates the transcription of essential genes for DNAreplication [19]. In both normal and tumor cells, pRBoscillates between an active (hypophosphorylated) statein early G1 and an inactive (hyperphosphorylated) state
in the late G1, S and G2/M phases [18]. Therefore, phos-
phorylation and subsequent inactivation of pRB repre-sents a key event governing cell proliferation.
There have been few studies which applied systems biol-
ogy approaches to identify novel markers [20] and to
define drug target networks in human cancer and other
pathologies [21]. In this study, we focused on the regula-tion of pRB through ERBB-receptor signaling at a networklevel in a de novo trastuzumab resistant cell system to iden-
tify new potential perturbation points leading to cell cyclearrest. Instead of single candidate gene approach, whichgenerally examines the role of a single protein considering
it either in conjunction with a second protein or regard-
less to other proteins, we applied a systems biologyapproach to identify the role of each component in thecontext of protein interaction networks. This strategy ismotivated by the fact that cells react to perturbation of asingle protein by taking advantage of using alternative
ways to keep the system robust. In drug resistance, these
alternative ways allow bypassing the inhibitory effect ofdrug treatment. Therefore, in order to find the uncommonperturbations to which cells cannot find an efficient wayto react, we first integrated published data to build theprotein network for ERBB-receptor regulated cell cycle
progression, then combined qualitative dynamical mode-
ling and robust experimental approaches, and finally pre-dicted suitable and efficient targets for individual orcombinatorial treatments in de novo trastuzumab resist-
ance in breast cancer as a model system.
We used the Boolean logical framework for the dynamical
modeling and analysis of the biological network. Thisframework simplifies the regulatory activity of proteins byconsidering them as all or none devices. More precisely,each protein is defined as being either active (value 1) orinactive (value 0) depending on its abundance or activitylevel. We selected 18 proteins connecting ERBB receptor
signaling to the G1/S transition of cell cycle, and defined
logical rules to describe their regulations with regard to lit-erature information. Modeling and loss of function simu-lations of the network proteins were performed using themodeling and simulation software GINsim [22,23]http://
gin.univ-mrs.fr/GINsim .
Experimental perturbations of each network element
using RNAi and following measurements of their effectson the output protein allowed us to compare simulations
BMC Systems Biology  2009, 3:1 http://www.biomedcent ral.com/1752-0509/3/1

with the experimental results. Quantitative measurements
of protein abundance and activation states using reverse
phase protein arrays (RPPA) [24,25] enabled us to reverseengineer the interactions of proteins in the cell system weused, and to compare the experimental network data withpublished results of single protein analysis. Utilizing spe-cific inhibitors against potential targets alone or in combi-
nation with trastuzumab, we further validated the RNAi
experiments and finally defined potential future therapeu-tic strategies.
Results
Characterization of the de novo trastuzumab resistant cell
system
We first identified a suitable de novo trastuzumab resistant
cell system as prerequisite for studying the ERBB-receptorregulated network. This cell system should have highERBB2 expression but be resistant to trastuzumab treat-ment. To this end, we first analyzed several breast carci-noma cell lines and the normal epithelial MCF-12A cell
line for their expression of ERBB family receptors at
mRNA and protein levels, respectively (Figure 1A and 1B).HCC1954 cells, like SK-BR-3 and BT474 cells, expresshigh levels of EGFR (ERBB1) and ERBB2 receptors, buthave low levels of ERBB3. ERBB4 receptor expression wasnot detected in the HCC1954 cell line.
Next, we examined the response to trastuzumab treatment
of breast carcinoma cells with high ERBB2 expression(HCC1954 and SK-BR-3) as compared to cells with lowERBB2 level (MCF-7) in a viability assay (Figure 1C). Cellswere treated with or without trastuzumab and cell viabil-
ity was assayed over time to observe the effect of the drug.
We further tested different concentrations of trastuzumabto rule out the possibility that the resistance of cell systemcould have been due to insufficient amounts of trastuzu-mab being present in the assay (Additional file 1, Figure1A). While SK-BR-3 cells responded to trastuzumab start-
ing from day two, HCC1954 cells were resistant, as they
did not show any response to the drug over four days.
Lastly, we verified the resistance of HCC1954 cells to tras-
tuzumab in 3-D cell culture (Figure 1D). After eight daysof treatment, HCC1954 cells were still growing in a largecluster-like structure that was similar to untreated
HCC1954 cells, whereas SK-BR-3 cells were sensitive to
trastuzumab also in 3-D culture. We could exclude thatthe resistance phenotype of HCC1954 cells was due to ahigher or lower ERBB2 expression level compared to sen-sitive SK-BR-3 cells (Additional file 1, Figure 1B). Further-more, to rule out the potential impact of possible
mutations in the ERBB2 protein on resistance phenotype
of the HCC1954 cells, the ERBB2 gene sequence was veri-
fied by sequencing and no mutation was found. Hence,HCC1954 cells were chosen as a de novo trastuzumab
resistant model cell system in this study.
Determination of experimental output
Next, we characterized HCC1954 cells with regard to G1/
S progression by measuring the levels of pRB phosphor-ylation, and of cell cycle proteins by comparing MOCK
(only lipofectamine transfection reagent) and CDK4
siRNA transfected cells. After synchronization, we stimu-lated the cells with EGF. Starting from "0 hour (no EGF)",cells were lysed at different time points and proteins ofinterest were detected with specific antibodies (Figure2A). CDK4 knockdown was efficient, as no residual pro-
tein was visible on the blot. Due to Dif-3 treatment, which
degrades Cyclin D1 at both mRNA and protein levels [26],the level of Cyclin D1 was low at 0 h while it increasedupon continuous EGF stimulation. After 6 h of EGF stim-ulation, Cyclin D1 expression remained constant until 24hours in both MOCK-treated cells and after CDK4 knock-down. For the MOCK control, a gradual increase in the
Cyclin E1 level was observed, starting from EGF stimula-
tion (0 hour) to 18 hours. In contrast, Cyclin E1 expres-sion did not change from 0 h to 18 h after CDK4knockdown. Surprisingly, we observed a reduction also ofCDK2 in the CDK4-siRNA treated cells, starting at 6 h.This might be due to the partnering of CDK2 with Cyclin
E1, whose level did not increase in case of CDK4 knock-
down.
We found the phosphorylation of pRB (Ser 807/811), our
marker for G1/S transition, to be delayed and the pRBexpression level to be decreased after CDK4 knockdown,
as compared to the MOCK control. Hence, we next quan-
tified the phosphorylation level of pRB (Figure 2B) in thesame lysates using reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA).The phosphorylation level of pRB was found to be low inthe growth-arrested cells and induction of pRB phosphor-ylation from 6 to 12 hours did not occur abruptly for
CDK4 knockdown compared to MOCK. These data dem-
onstrate that phosphorylation of pRB at the transitionpoint can be quantified by RPPA as an output of EGF stim-ulation.
Literature-based Boolean ne twork of G1/S transition
The initial network of G1/S transition was built by extract-
ing information from the literature about interactions
between proteins involved in receptor tyrosine kinase-reg-ulated cell cycle progression (Additional file 1, Table 1).The resulting network encompasses 18 proteins, includ-ing EGF as stimulus, homo- and heterodimers of ERBBfamily members, tyrosine kinase receptor IGF-1R, key
transcription factors (ER- α and c-MYC), key signaling
intermediates (AKT1 and MEK1), and G1/S transition cyc-lins, CDKs and CDK inhibitors (Figure 3). Upon activa-tion, members of the ERBB family of tyrosine kinases

form homo- and heterodimers. For HCC1954 cells, six
different such dimers are possible as ERBB4 is not
expressed in this cell line. The dimers ERBB1/ERBB2,
ERBB1/ERBB3 and ERBB2/ERBB3 were represented asspecific nodes in the network. Homodimers were implic-itly represented by the corresponding protein nodes. Sinceno ligand is known for ERBB2 homodimers [27] and asERBB3 homodimers have a defective tyrosine kinase
domain [28], the corresponding nodes are unable to acti-
vate the ERBB targets AKT1 and MEK1. The effects of thecombinations of interactions on the activity of each pro-tein was defined in terms of logical rules using theBoolean operators AND , OR, and NOT . Table 1 lists these
Boolean rules for the network components, and data sup-porting the rules is provided in the Additional file 1, Table
1. We then utilized the modeling and simulation software
GINsim [23] to implement these rules into a computa-tional model. Figure 3 shows the resulting logical regula-tory graph for the ERBB receptor-regulated G1/S transitionprotein network. Normal arrows denote positive regula-tions, which are either through phosphorylation, tran-
scriptional activation, or physical interaction (e.g,.
complex formation). Blunt-ended arrows denote negativeregulations. The numbers associated with each edge refersto the respective publications providing experimentaldata in support of the corresponding regulatory interac-
tion (Additional file 1, Table 1).
Simulation of loss-of-functions
For loss-of-function simulations, we performed in silico
knockdowns of the network proteins by fixing the level ofthe perturbed element to "0", meaning that the corre-sponding protein was always "inactive" (Additional file 1,
Figure 2). Each simulation was performed for specific ini-
tial protein states, matching the biological and experi-mental conditions (for several proteins, we consideredboth possible values). For example, the initial states ofp21 and p27, both of which being CDK inhibitors, wereset to "1" because, in G0/G1 arrested cells, the expressionlevels of these inhibitors are high and their levels decrease
(due to their degradation in proteasomes) once cells
progress through S phase [29]. To represent continuousEGF simulation, the initial values of ERBB nodes were setto "1". Since the cells had been synchronized with Dif-3,which degrades Cyclin D1, the initial level of Cyclin D1was set to "0". Using the resulting initial states, we com-
puted all possible state transitions and iterated until we
finally obtained a unique "stable state" in which the levelof each protein was fixed (details about knockdown sim-ulations can be found in Materials and Methods section).Proof of principle experiments for the determination of G1/S transition poin t in trastuzumab resistant HCC1954 cells Figure 2

Table 2 summarizes the outcomes of the simulations. Out
of 17 loss-of-function simulations, a significant decreaseof pRB phosphorylation (pRB is predominantly in itshyphophosphorylated form and cells do not progressthrough G1/S transition: pRB = 0) was predicted forCDK4, Cyclin D1, and CDK6 loss of functions. For the
ERBB1_2 and ERBB1_3 knockdowns, we obtained two
possible stable states characterized by pRB = 0 and 1 thatshould be resolved with experimental results. The loss-of-function simulations for all other network proteinsresulted in the preservation of pRB phosphorylation (pRB= 1), thus tentatively enabling G1/S transition.
Furthermore, we have also simulated the loss-of-function
of multiple proteins (all double and many triple knock-downs) (Additional file 2, Table 1). We have observedthat if one protein knockdown gives pRB = 0, the combi-nation of any other protein knockdown with this one alsogives pRB = 0 (e.g. ER- α knockdown gives pRB = 0 and ER-
α+AKT1 knockdown also gives pRB = 0) and we have ver-
ified this experimentally as well (Additional file 2, Table2). We have also simulated the knockdown of all threereceptors at the same time (ERBB1_2_3) and it resulted in2 stables states with pRB = 1 or 0 (Additional file 2, Table1).Assessment of siRNA knockdown efficiency and specificity
for experimental testing of simulations
In order to validate the simulations having been per-
formed for various possible loss of functions, we utilizedRNAi to experimentally induce knockdown of the corre-sponding proteins. First, we validated the siRNAs accord-ing to their knockdown efficiency at both mRNA and
protein levels by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respec-
tively (Figure 4A and 4B). We obtained at least 70%knockdown at mRNA level for all the network proteins(Figure 4A) and for most a similar knockdown also at theprotein level (Figure 4B), both in single and combinato-rial RNAi settings [24]. Because of the high level of
sequence conservation among ERBB family receptors
[27], it was imperative to test for a potential cross-reactiv-ity of ERBB receptor siRNAs (Figure 4C and 4D). To thisend, we compared the effects of the pools of four siRNAsfor every gene with those of individual siRNAs. Neitherpools nor individual siRNAs were found to have cross-reactivity (Figure 4C and 4D).
In the combinatorial RNAi settings, the levels of the ERBB
proteins in the EGFR/ERBB2, EGFR/ERBB3, and ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers were efficiently downregulated (Fig-ure 4B). While the EGFR level was drastically reducedwhen we applied double knockdown of EGFR/ERBB2,
EGFR/ERBB3, and ERBB2/ERBB3 (Figure 4B), the EGFR
protein was stable in the single knockdown with EGFRsiRNA although this treatment resulted in more than 80%knockdown at the mRNA level (Figure 4A). However,knockdown of the ERBB2 receptor resulted in a substan-tial decrease of EGFR at the protein level. With respect to
the qRT-PCR results, we can exclude that this effect could
be due to a cross-reaction of the ERBB2 siRNA (Figure4C). Therefore, we hypothesize an indispensable partner-ing of ERBB2 and EGFR in ERBB2 overexpressing cells(Figure 4D), and assume that the EGFR receptor protein isefficiently stabilized that way. This hypothesis was sup-
ported by similar observations made in ERBB2 overex-
pressing SK-BR-3 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 havinglow ERBB2 expression (Additional file 1, Figure 3).
Experimental validation of loss-of-function simulations
Next, we designed a series of in vitro experiments using the
validated conditions described above to assess the results
from loss of function simulations. Lysates of three biolog-
ical replicates were analyzed with RPPA using four techni-cal replicates of each. The signal intensity ofphosphorylated pRB was measured in the near-infraredrange (NIR) for each knockdown at two time points (0 hand 12 h). As a negative control, we utilized MOCK sam-
ples which had not been stimulated with EGF. Results
were compared to MOCK samples (reference sample),which had been stimulated with EGF, and the significanceof the impact on pRB phosphorylation was tested usingTable 1: Boolean rules for the ac tivation of each component of
the network presented in Figure 3.

e-mail: dina.petranovic@chalmers.seProgrammed cell death (PCD) is an essential cellular mechanism that is evolutionary con-
served, mediated through various pathways and acts by integrating different stimuli. Many
diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancers are found to be caused by, or
associated with, regulations in the cell death pathways.Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is
a unicellular eukaryotic organism that shares with human cells components and pathways
of the PCD and is therefore used as a model organism. Boolean modeling is becoming
promising approach to capture qualitative behavior and describe essential properties of
such complex networks. Here we present large literature-based and to our knowledge ﬁrst

that accumulation of Bax in silico humanized yeast shows apoptotic markers and that VCP
is essential target of Akt Signaling. The presented Boolean model provides comprehen-

INTRODUCTION
Apoptosis is a complex process which is strictly under control of
several regulatory networks. Any kind of malfunctioning in these
controlling systems due to insufﬁcient or excessive apoptosis sig-
nal can potentially lead to threatening diseases such as various
types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore keep-
ing this process tightly regulated is important for the cell. Even
though apoptosis is often studied in multicellular organisms, the
discovery of yeast apoptosis in 1997 ( Madeo et al., 1997 ) attracted
the attention of the wide research community ( Frohlich et al.,
2007 ;Owsianowski et al., 2008 ;Madeo et al., 2009 ;Carmona-
Gutierrez et al., 2010b ). As in other multicellular organisms the
apoptosis in yeast is triggered by both internal and external sig-
nals. In yeast, the external signals can include acetic acid ( Ludovico
et al., 2001, 2002 ), salts, metal ions, ethanol, osmotic stress, heat
stress ( Madeo et al., 2009 ), lipids ( Aerts et al., 2008 ;Low et al.,
2008 ;Garbarino et al., 2009 ), mating pheromone ( Zhang et al.,
2006 ), different pharmacological molecules, and drugs ( Almeida
et al., 2008 ). Internal signals can include, ammonium, NO, ROS
(that can be generated within the cell by mitochondria and the
ER, and also induced by H 2O2addition ( Madeo et al., 1999 )
and other factors), damage (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) as a
consequence of aging and mutations ( Mazzoni et al., 2005 ;Wein-
berger et al., 2005 ;Hauptmann et al., 2006 ), as well as expressionof heterologous proteins, such as human pro-apoptotic proteins
(Eisenberg et al., 2007 ). Many proteins residing in the cytoplasm,
nucleus, mitochondria, ER, peroxisomes, and lysosomes have been
identiﬁed as the regulators of apoptosis. For example, proteoly-
sis is one of the main steps that leads to execution of cell death
and, a yeast metacaspase Yca1p has been shown to be central
for most (but not all) cell death scenarios ( Madeo et al., 2002,
2009 ). Besides degradation of proteins, degradation of nucleic
acids is also carried out during apoptotic death and one of the two
important caspase-independent mediators is Nuc1p (homolog
of endonuclease G; Buttner et al., 2007 ). The second is Aif1p
(apoptosis-inducing factor; Wissing et al., 2004 ) that is together
with Nuc1p released from the mitochondrion and translocated
to the nucleus during the initiation and execution of apopto-
sis. The regulation of apoptosis in the nucleus, is achieved via
pro-apoptotic factor Nma111p (nuclear mediator of apoptosis;
Fahrenkrog et al., 2004 ) a serine protease that cleaves an anti-
apoptotic factor (inhibitor of apoptosis, IAP) Bir1p, which is
the only known IAP in yeast, and its anti-apoptotic mechanisms
(known to be YCA1-independent) are not well characterized ( Wal-
ter et al., 2006 ). T o understand how large and complex network
of apoptosis process is regulated it should be studied as a whole
allowing identiﬁcation of the properties essential for biological
function ( Janes et al., 2005 ). T o complement experimental studies

Kazemzadeh et al. Boolean model of yeast apoptosis
mathematical models are often use permitting systematic analysis
of the network components either individually or jointly (Wolken-
hauer, 2002; Stelling, 2004). In Boolean networks (BN) introduced
by Kauffman (1969) these assumptions are made based on activa-
tion/inhibition effects of one node on another downstream node.
The Boolean “on” state (or 1 state or “true” state) can be translate
to biological active state of speciﬁc species, while “off” state (or
0 state or “false” state) corresponds to inactive state. With sim-
ple logical rules (AND, OR, and NOT) it is possible to capture
system’s behavior in a discrete manner without being dependent
on experimental measurements such as molecular concentration
or kinetic rates. This type of model implementation is becom-
ing more common in biology (Handorf and Klipp, 2012) and
examples include various model organisms and processes, rang-
ing from cell cycle models of simple ﬁssion yeast (Davidich and
Bornholdt, 2008), to complex dynamic analysis of mammalian
cell cycle (Fauré et al., 2006), study of mammalian neurotrans-
mitter signaling pathway (Gupta et al., 2007), investigation of
irreversible mammalian apoptosis and stable surviving (Mai and
Liu, 2009), and model of apoptosis in human (Schlatter et al.,
2009). In each of these studies different extensions of Boolean
modeling is implemented giving clear indication of the grow-
ing application of logic based modeling in qualitative studies of
biological networks where there is not much quantitative data
available.
We describe here a model based on Boolean network approach
that consists of two parts: in the ﬁrst part construction and
the evaluation of the yeast apoptosis Boolean model is intro-
duced and in the second part we propose the use of established
model for study of human apoptotic proteins in yeast. Simplic-
ity of BN allowed us to construct the model that integrates vast
amount of heterogeneous knowledge that currently exists for yeast
apoptosis. The major purpose of this study is to understand the
emergence of systems properties. Extensive analysis of the state
space in combination of different input signals generated series
ofin silico experiments. Simulating knock out experiments we
were able to test the function of speciﬁc feedback structures in
apoptotic network. The results were compared with the exist-
ing experimental data and the model was used to explore several
hypotheses in order to better understand certain apoptotic mech-
anisms and to suggest new strategies for further experimental
studies.
RESULTS
NETWORK TOPOLOGY
The constructed yeast apoptosis network contains 73 species
and 115 reactions ( T able 1 ). Six species do not have succes-
sor (Sink/Output) or predecessor (Source/Input; T able 2 ). In the
schematic diagram ( Figure 1 ) species are represented as nodes and
reactions as edges. Species include: processes, proteins, and small
molecules (metabolites or signals) and Reactions include activa-
tion (green arrow) and inhibition (red arrow). Nine nodes depict
inputs to the model and are colored blue. Seventeen elements are
active in nucleus and are shown in gray, 12 mitochondria species
are shown in yellow, and 34 orange boxes represent species resid-
ing in cytoplasm. System has only one output node which is called“Apoptosis” and it is in dark blue. Filled blue circles are used as
an “AND” gates between two or more reactions to indicate the
necessity of presence of two species for activation or inhibition of
a reaction ( Figure 1 ).
Network is activated via input signals corresponding to the fol-
lowing species: Acetic Acid, Heat, H 2O2, Adozelesin, Mg2C, Cu2C,
Salt (NaCl), mating, and osmotic stress.
MODEL PROPERTIES
Like many molecular mechanisms in living cells, apoptosis can be
approximated as an outcome of sequential regulation steps which
do not occur all at the same time. As a result, upon induction,
the state of the cell changes with passing time. In order to cap-
ture this feature, each reaction was assigned activation time scale
implicating occurrences of different scenarios in sequential order.
By introducing time delays to the logical function, it is possible
to describe dynamic behavior of the given process using logical
networks (Thomas and D’Ari, 1990).
For this study we used Cell Net Analyser (CNA; Klamt et al.,
2006) which provides the function to capture signal propagation
in a time series to get a snapshot of the network and discrim-
ination of signaling events. This approach has been successfully
used to model human apoptotic network revealing new feedback
loops (Schlatter et al., 2009). T o describe dynamic behavior of
the yeast apoptosis ﬁve timescales tD[0, 2, 4, 5, 6] are assigned.
These timescales are constants and indicate at which timescale
each node gets activated or inhibited. Simulation of the network
attDxcomprises of all interactions with timescale txbut not
interactions with tx. This gives the possibility of separation of
different functional groups such as different signaling pathways
or feedback loops. It should be noted that speciﬁed timescales do
not refer to real time but are only indicators of sequential regu-
latory steps (difference between timescale tD0 and tD2 is equal
to difference between timescales tD2 and tD4 ortD4 and tD5
or between tD5 and tD6). Timescales are not assigned based
on speed of reactions (how fast or slow reactions are), they are
assigned based on the sequence of events. T o allow ﬂexibility in
our model and facilitate changes and insertions of new events
timescales 1 and 3 are reserved and not used in the current net-
work structure. First timescale tD0 is assigned to genes which
are already present and constantly active in cell (27 reactions).
Values for all input arcs to stimuli species are set to 1 at second
timescale tD2 (53 reactions). Further interactions are activated
at time tD4 (17 reactions). Although yeast apoptosis does not
contain any feedback loops time point tD5 is reserved for feed-
back loops which get activated in response to osmotic and heats
shock and will lead to apoptosis. Considering impact of feed-
back loops on system behavior it is reasonable to assign them a
separate timescale. Finally interaction occurring at the very end
are assigned timescale tD6 (18 reactions). Details on each reac-
tion, their time points and species involved in reactions are in
T able 3 .
The model simulated the induction of apoptosis both in the
independent mode (assessing each individual stimulus separately)
as well as in the additive mode, where the activation of all inputs
were set at the same time ( T able 4 ).

PREDICTIONS WITH THE CONTINUOUS MODEL
Based on qualitative knowledge we have constructed a discrete
Boolean model of yeast apoptosis. While it can capture its essen-
tial behavior, the question remained how this model can be used to
predict the qualitative behavior of the system. In order to address
this question we expanded the model by transforming the discrete
Boolean model into a continuous model using Odefy (Wittmann
et al., 2009; Krumsiek et al., 2010; see Materials and Methods).
In order to test the continuous model and its predictive capac-
ity, we performed three independent case-studies: (i) inductionof apoptosis by activation of Hog1p by heat stress, (ii) inhibition
by Bir1p of acetic acid-induced apoptosis, and (iii) induction of
apoptosis with H 2O2by activation of Stm1p. We show here that
the behavior that emerges from speciﬁc interactions in the model
is in agreement with published experimental data.
ACTIVATION OF HEAT STRESS-INDUCED APOPTOSIS WITH Hog1p
We simulated the activation of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase that is a key component of the HOG pathway (Albertyn
and Hohmann, 1994; Van Wuytswinkel et al., 2000; Hohmann,
2002; de Nadal et al., 2004), which is an osmoregulatory sig-
nal transduction cascade (Hohmann, 2009). Upon stress, Hog1p
(encoded by HOG1/YLR113W) regulates the expression of almost
600 genes by phosphorylating several different transcription fac-
tors (Hohmann, 2002; Westfall et al., 2004). The activity and
nuclear localization of Hog1p is regulated by its phosphorylation
state, and that in turn is regulated by the kinase MAPKK Pbs2p and
the phosphatases Ptc1p, Ptc2p, Ptc3p, Ptp2p, and Ptp3p (Brewster
et al., 1993; Ferrigno et al., 1998; Warmka et al., 2001; Y oung et al.,
2002). Besides the induction by osmotic stress, the HOG path-
way can be induced by heat stress, viaa Sho1p-dependent sensory
mechanism (Winkler et al., 2002), thus we used heat stress as an
input to activate the HOG pathway and simulate the cell death
response. Heat stress activates Slt2 which then activates Rlm1.
Consequently Rlm1 triggers expression of Slt2 and PTP2 form-
ing a feedback loop. On the other hand heat shock inhibits activity

of PKA leading to release the inhibition effect of PKA on MSN2-
4. MSN2-4 activates Sdp1 which then along with PTP2 inhibit
Slt2. We started by setting all other stimuli to zero and then by
transforming the Boolean apoptosis model into Hill Cube contin-
uous model we performed the simulations. Steady states predicted
from continuous Hill Cube ( Figure 2 ) and synchronous Boolean
(Figure 3 ) model are in perfect agreement with each other for all
nodes apart from the nodes corresponding to the feedback loops
in response to heat and osmotic stress. Feedback loop in heat acti-
vated pathway includes activation of Rlm1 by Slt2 and expression
of Slt2 by Rlm1. Osmotic shock induced Hog1 activates Rlm1
to regulate Slt2 which was inhibited by osmotic shock and PTP2.
Unknown Hog1 dependent transcription factor triggers transcrip-
tion of PTP3 and PTP2 resulting in dephosphorylation of Hog1
phosphotyrosine which inhibits Hog1 activities. All nodes in our
model were connected to activation of apoptosis viathe heat shock
pathway and were indeed activated in our simulation and are col-
ored in red; other pathways are colored in blue indicating that they
are not activated during the simulation ( Figure 2 ). Model predicts
that upon heat induction, concentration of Hog1p changes trough
time never reaching its maximum level of concentration and as an
intensity of stimulus decreases level of Hog1p also decreases. Oursimulations also proposed that the maximal level of activation of
Hog1p during heat stress is 70% of the total activation and as the
heat stimulus continues over time its activity decreases and reaches
a plateau at 40% of total activation ( Figure 4 ).
This model prediction is in agreement with an experimental
measurement performed by Winkler et al. (2002) which shows the
induced activity of Hog1p upon heat induction ( Figure 4 ). The
difference between the maximal activity values and the lag phase of
the activation is due to the fact that we did not use any quantitative
data as input to the model.
INHIBITION OF ACETIC ACID-INDUCED APOPTOSIS WITH Bir1p
Even though there are several genes and pathways that are involved
in yeast pro-apoptotic response, there are only few anti-apoptotic
genes. For many years Bir1p (encoded by BIR1/YJR089W) was
thought to be the only apoptotic inhibitor in yeast, but recently
a TSC22-protein family was found and two of the proteins
with TSC22-motif have been shown to have anti-apoptotic roles
Sno1p and Fvy10p (Khoury et al., 2008). Bir1 belongs to the
IAP family and phylogenetic analysis (Uren et al., 1998) showed
similarity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe BIR1, human survivin,
and Caenorhabditis elegance BIR-1 and BIR-2 proteins. Y east’s

Table includes time scale scenario upon induction of all stimuli.T stands for differ-
ent time steps. As an example if Acetic Acid is inducted to the cell at time point 0
it is expected to cause DNA Fragmentation at next time step and eventually ends
to apoptosis in last step.
Bir1p has been previously intensively studied in chromosome seg-
regation (as a component of the Aurora kinase complex (chromo-
some passenger complex, CPC; Ruchaud et al., 2007) but recently
studies of its role as a negative regulator of apoptosis have gained
momentum. It has been shown that Bir1p is a target for degrada-
tion by Nma111p (Owsianowski et al., 2008), an apoptotic serine
protease and yeast cells lacking Bir1 are more sensitive to apopto-
sis, while overexpression of Bir1 reduces apoptosis (Walter et al.,
2006).When building the model we assumed that addition of
acetic acid induces cytochrome crelease from mitochondria
and its translocation to the cytosol. Another assumption is that
the execution of apoptosis is Yca1p-dependent (encoded by
YCA1/MCA1/YOR197W) in this context and that the activation
of the caspase is downstream from the cytochrome ctransloca-
tion (Ludovico et al., 2001, 2002). Thus, taking these assumptions
into account acetic acid was used as an inducer in the simula-
tions with direct induction of apoptosis. The model conﬁrmed
experimental evidence that Bir1 is indeed apoptosis inhibitor in
yeast (Walter et al., 2006) and as acetic acid is applied as a pulse
stimulus (that is then decreasing over time) and cytochrome c
present in the cytosol increases, the decrease of Bir1p due to
Nma111p degradation promotes apoptosis that then reaches the
maximum ( Figure 5A ). We then performed an artiﬁcial and bio-
logically irrelevant simulation: after apoptosis has occurred and
no more inducer was present (acetic acid is not added again and
the previously added amount has been “used”) the eventual the-
oretical accumulation of Bir1p did inhibit apoptosis and revert it
to zero. Obviously this scenario is biologically implausible, since
once the cell has undergone apoptosis it cannot be revived, but
has a purpose to show mathematical correctness of the developed
model.
Additionally, we have converted discreet apoptosis model to
continuous model with constant presence of Bir1 in order to
test if this type of model would predict the same outcome as
the experimental approach in which Bir1p is overexpressed and
provides protection from induction of apoptosis. The continu-
ous model was created taking into account translocation effect
of each element from one compartment to another. This effect
has been applied to translocation of Nuc1 from mitochondria to
nucleus, MCD1 from nucleus to mitochondria, Stm1 from cytosol
to nucleus Aif1 (from mitochondria to nucleus, NMA111 from
cytosol to nucleus, Ste20 from cytosol to nucleus, and cytochrome

cfrom mitochondria to cytosol. Initially, in this model, translo-
cation of each species is modeled as one node in order to rep-
resent the re-localization which introduced self-regulatory loops
to the system which is impossible since to our knowledge yeast
apoptosis regulatory network does not have such loops. One
solution implies intuitive approach in deﬁning single variable
for single species to mimic the effect of transferring from one
compartment to another. T echnically this was solved by intro-
ducing two variables for a single species representing both com-
partments they can belong to. This approach, also, conﬁrmed
experimental ﬁnding (Walter et al., 2006) that constant pres-
ence of Bir1, inhibits apoptosis, validating Bir1 anti-apoptotic role
(Figure 5B ).
ACTIVATION OF H 2O2-INDUCED APOPTOSIS WITH Stm1p
It has been shown that degradation of short-lived pro-apoptotic
proteins via proteasomal – ubiquitine pathway plays important
role in mammalian apoptosis (Drexler, 1997). One of the yeast
proteasomal substrates – Stm1 (YLR150W) was identiﬁed in the
study by Ligr et al. (2001) as an activator of the cell death process.
Conserved orthologs of Stm1 are detected in several species (highlyconserved ortholog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and a putative
ortholog in Drosophila melanogaster (Nelson et al., 2000) suggest-
ing that regulation of apoptosis via this protein can be evolutionary
conserved process.
We have in silico tested two scenarios conﬁrming the role of
Stm1 in apoptosis (Ligr et al., 2001). Accumulation of Stm1 will
induce apoptotic behavior followed by DNA fragmentation which
is a known marker of cell death, while the Stm1 knock out will
promote survival and consequently deterring DNA fragmentation
(Figures 6A,B ).
IN SILICO HUMANIZED YEAST APOPTOSIS
S. cerevisiae is a model organism that has conserved genes, pro-
teins and pathways that are similar to the ones in the human cells.
This allows for using yeast as a host in which human genes can be
expressed, so called “humanized yeast” (Winderickx et al., 2008)
and subsequently the physiological roles and molecular mecha-
nisms can be studied. In order to test if our system could be used
in a similar way ( in silico humanized yeast) and provide reliable
simulations and predictions, we inserted three human genes with
complete downstream pathways into our initial yeast apoptosis

of Bax has been linked to the release of cytochrome cfrom mito-
chondria (Manon et al., 1997). Y east cells with Bax expression
accumulate ROS and show other apoptotic hallmarks such as DNA
fragmentation (Madeo et al., 1999).
Since members of this protein family were previously success-
fully expressed in yeast, we ﬁrst validate the “humanized” yeast
model by inserting Bcl-xL, Bax, Bad, and Bcl-2 genes (Sato et al.,
1994; Greenhalf et al., 1996; Madeo et al., 1999). As an input signalhuman Akt signaling was used (Akt Signaling), as an extrinsic
regulatory switch (since this signaling cascade is not present in
yeast). The Akt Serine/Threonine-kinase promotes cell survival by
phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (member of the
Bcl-2 family), which is the cause of dissociation of BAD from the
Bcl-2/Bcl-X complex, and promotion of cell survival (Datta et al.,
1997). Besides cell survival, Akt signaling is related to the cell cycle,
metabolism, and angiogenesis and therefore a target for anticancer
drug development (Falasca, 2010; Hers et al., 2011).
Upon activation of Akt Signaling at the ﬁrst time step ( tD0,
node value Akt Signaling D1), Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are activated in
the following step ( tD4, node value Bcl-xL D1 and Bcl-2D1)
and remain active throughout the simulation and as the inhibitors
of apoptosis promote the survival (node value Apoptosis D0;
T able 5 ). Simulation results suggest the anti-apoptotic role of two
Bcl-2 family members: Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL which is consistent with
experimental ﬁndings (Kharbanda et al., 1997).
DUAL FUNCTIONALITY OF VCP IN SURVIVAL AND APOPTOSIS
The evolutionary conserved Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is
a mammalian ortholog of yeast Cdc48, which is the ﬁrst apoptotic
mediator found in S. cereivisae (Braun and Zischka, 2008). VCP is

the member AAA-ATPase family which is ubiquitously expressed
(Braun and Zischka, 2008). It consists of four domains: N-terminal
domain, two ATPase domains D1 and D2 and C-terminal domain
(Wang et al., 2004). The major ATPase activity of VCP is carried

continues simulation.on by D2 domain (Wang et al., 2004; Song et al., 2003). VCP is
involved in different cellular process such as protein degradation,
membrane fusion and chaperone activity (Braun and Zischka,
2008). Role of VCP/Cdc48 in ﬂuctuating number of death cell
in various types of disease naming cancer and protein deposition
diseases is not well understood. Increase in expression of VCP
is correlated to the development of cancer and metastasis there-
fore detecting the level of VCP expression is proposed as cancer
progression marker. Also VCP is known as detector of aggregated
proteins causing neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson and
Alzheimer (Hirabayashi et al., 2001; Mizuno et al., 2003; Ishigaki
et al., 2004). It has been observed that yeast cell carrying mutation
of Cdc48 is showing morphological markers of apoptosis (Madeo
et al., 1997) and that depletion of this protein has apoptotic effect
in other organisms as well (Imamuraab et al., 2003).
It had been shown that VCP can both promote or inhibit apop-
tosis (Braun and Zischka, 2008). Deletion of VCP triggers ER stress
which is followed by unfolded protein response and cell death via
ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway – a highly conserved
pathway between mammalian and yeast cells (Braun and Zischka,
2008). Wild type VCP has pro-apoptotic role in the cells undergo-
ing apoptosis upon ER stress which in turn triggers ER-associated
apoptotic pathway. Finally VCP can trigger survival pathway in
response to NFkB which is a pro-survival molecule in cells with
over expressed level of VCP/Cdc48(Braun and Zischka, 2008).
The dual functionality of VCP in survival and apoptosis mech-
anism makes it an attractive candidate to be inserted in initial
yeast apoptosis Boolean network. Since VCP includes expression
of a handful of heterologous proteins, its in vivo insertion to
yeast plasmid would be difﬁcult to perform and thus represents a

good candidate for further investigation and exploration of model
capabilities.
In our model, yeast Cdc48 was replaced with human VCP gene
and its downstream pathway effector caspases (caspases 3, 6 and
7), initiator caspases (caspase9 and 12), IAP family, IkB-alpha
inhibitory protein which when degraded by proteasome cause the
release, and nuclear translocation of active NFkB (represented in
the model as NFkB_Cyt and NFkB_Nuc) and gp130/Stat3 pathway
(represented as a single node).
Upon activation of Akt Signaling pro-survival role of VCP is
observed (node Survival D1 at tD6,T able 3 ). This is achieved
when IkB ais dissociated from NFkB (node NFkB/IkB aD1 at
tD4), which in turn gets activated (node NFkB D1,tD5)
and is translocated to the nucleus (nodes NFkB_Cyt D1 and
NFkB_NucD1,tD6) inducing survival of the cell (node Sur-
vivalD1,tD6). Simultaneously, activation of NFkB, promotes
activity of IAP family of proteins which inhibits the activity of both
effector and initiator caspases (nodes c-3-6-7 D0 and c-9-12D0,
tD[0,4,5,6], thus disabling apoptosis-dependent caspase pathway.
As an independent, but parallel process, activation of VCP via
Akt Signaling activates gp130-Stat3 (node gp130-Stat3 D1,tD4)
pathway and consequently leads to survival ( T able 6 ).
This result suggests that yeast carrying mammalian VCP gene
exhibits the same behavior as it is known from the human
apoptotic model (Vandermoere et al., 2006).
DISCUSSION
In this work we have constructed a Boolean model for the bio-
chemical network that controls apoptosis pathway in budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Firstly, we presented the Boolean
model describing only yeast pro and anti-apoptotic genes and val-
idated the model by further analyzing the role of Stm1p, Bir1p,
and Hog1p. Even though construction of the yeast apoptosis net-
work involved certain simpliﬁcations (nodes have only two states
and rules are describing network dynamics) we were able to model
more complex network than using dynamic modeling approach
that requires knowledge of kinetic parameters for all molecular
processes. This approach was able to suggest general design prin-
cipals of yeast apoptosis. One of the advantages of constructing
mathematical models in biology is that we are able to simulateT able 6 | Summary of simulations upon insertion of VCP pathway.

scenarios that are not feasible in real experiments. In the case
of Bir1 pwe were able to in silico revive a cell already reaching
apoptosis. These examples are important to understand general
mechanisms of the constructed network. A study of proteasomal
substrate Stm1p suggested that Stm1p seems to be an effector of
H2O2and the presence of Stm1p with an inducer leads to apopto-
sis in our model, and in Stm1p knock out survival is promoted and
DNA fragmentation is avoided, irrespective of the presence of the
inducer. Despite the limitation of BN in terms of giving quanti-
tative predictions of the system dynamics they allow investigation
of the large networks and their systematic exploration resulting
in better understanding of cellular processes. Example of Hog1p
study showed that our model was capable of reproducing the pat-
tern of Hog1p activation, but was not able to quantitatively predict
the maximal Hog1p activity.
In the second stage, we extended the initial model by inserting
two pathways of human apoptosis (VCP and Bcl-2 family), hereby
creating a “humanized” in silico yeast. Humanized yeast strains are
used in experimental molecular biology where the human proteins
(causing, or associated with diseases) are expressed and studied
in vivo (in yeast in this case).
Conservation of many apoptotic mediators and mechanisms
among the Eukarya provides the possibility of inserting genes
from other organisms into yeast ( in vivo ) or in the yeast apop-
totic network ( in silico ). We validated constructed humanized
yeast model by insertion of Bcl-2 family which have been pre-
viously successfully expressed in yeast. The model was able to
reproduce well-known pro and anti-apoptotic phenotypes con-
ﬁrming that yeast expressing Bax accumulated ROS and showed
other apoptotic markers like DNA fragmentation. T o test whether
or not speciﬁc pathways playing role in neurodegeneration and
cancer can be elucidated by our Boolean model and can we con-
sequently take advantage of a simple system like yeast to explore
hypothesis generated for higher organisms, we in silico expressed
evolutionary conserved VCP and its downstream components in
existing yeast apoptosis network. VCP is important player in can-
cer cell survival and can be used as a target for cancer therapy. It

also serves as detector of aggregated proteins that are known to
be cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s. Our model showed that cell survival is mediated
by VCP via the degradation of IkB athat leads to translocation
of NFkB to nucleus. This result is in agreement with experi-
mental ﬁndings that VCP is an essential target in the Akt sig-
naling pathway suggesting that presented model in combination
with experimental approach would represents a promising plat-
form to study complex cellular processes involved in cancer and
neurodegeneration.
Exploiting the advantages of BN models that enables extrac-
tion of system level properties of large networks and extensive
state exploration and converting discrete model to continuous
model our results suggested that in contrast to human apoptotic
network yeast apoptosis is linear process whose regulation does
not involve any complex feedback loops. Analysis of the second
model showed that with certain adjustments Boolean model of
yeast apoptosis can be adapted for studies of apoptosis in higher
organisms.
Our results show that even without kinetic and qualitative data,
it is possible to build models that can simulate relevant states of
yeast physiology and regulations and can contribute to further
understanding of biology. Since yeast is a preferred model organ-
ism for many studies of fundamental processes in a Eukaryal cell,we argue that in silico studies of yeast will be an important contrib-
utor to the understanding of complex cellular regulations, such as
cell death pathways and that the applications will extend toward
study of regulations or causes of human diseases such as cancer
and neurodegeneration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
APOPTOSIS NETWORK SETUP
Based on the extensive literature study and databases search ( Sac-
charomyces Genome Database-SGD; Cherry et al., 2011) the apop-
tosis network consisting of 73 nodes and 115 edges is constructed.
These nodes are selected based on their interactions and their sub-
strates involved in apoptosis. Cell Designer (Funahashi et al., 2003)
was used to visualize genes and their connection. Cell Designer
allowed us to represent network using comprehensive graphical
notation. Moreover, Cell Designer is able to connect to online data
bases such as KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), BioModels (Li
et al., 2010) and PubMed which expands its connectivity, visual-
ization and model building. The most prominent advantage of Cell
Designer is its ability to support SBML (Systems Biology Markup
Language; Hucka et al., 2003) format. Creating SBML ﬁle avoids
creating logic rule ﬁle which is more error prone when rules have
to be deﬁned by user in simple text and it is not in form of easily
drawing boxes.

COMPUTATION OF LOGICAL STEADY STATES
Identiﬁcation of Logical Steady States (LSSs) in a Boolean net-
work is an important task as they comprise the states in which a
gene-regulatory network resides most of the time. Strong biolog-
ical implication can be carried out by LSSs of the network. LSSs
can even be linked to phenotype (Kauffman, 1969). CNA (Klamt
et al., 2006) is used to calculate all possible LLSs based on speciﬁed
initial value for each gene and signal ﬂow in network. LSSs are used
to evaluate the network behavior under perturbation and changes
in network structure.
IDENTIFYING NETWORK WIDE DEPENDENCY
Considering a pair of nodes (a, b) dependency is deﬁned as the
inﬂuence of node aon node band vice versa, node ainﬂuences
node bas follow: a is atotal activator of bif there is an activat-
ing path between aand b,ais a total inhibitor of bis there is
an inhibition path from atobor a is an ambivalent effecter of
b meaning that there is an intermediate node which is involved
in a negative feedback loop. Using CNA the interaction matrix

and 9).CONVERSION OF DISCRETE TO CONTINUOUS MODEL USING SQUAD
In order to convert the schematic network into Boolean model
we used SQUAD (Mendoza and Xenarios, 2006), a user friendly
graphical software which is suitable for modeling signaling net-
work where kinetic reactions are not available. Simulation in
SQUAD consists of three steps: (1) the network is ﬁrst loaded
from the SBML ﬁle. Components of the network are presented as
nodes and value of each node represents the state of that node.
SQUAD converts the network to discrete dynamic model. Using
Boolean algorithms all steady sates in network are calculated. (2)
network is converted to a continues dynamic model generating
sets of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and steady states
achieved in pervious step. (3) SQUAD allows perturbation in order
to understand the role of each node within the network.
Using Reduced Order Binary Decision Diagram (ROBDD), it
is possible to calculate steady states (Di Cara et al., 2007). ROBDD
is a memory efﬁcient data structure which is widely used in elec-
tronic ﬁeld and has been proven to work for large binary networks.
Moreover, ROBDD computes steady states for large networks
(n>50) in matter of seconds. Another advantage of this algorithm
is its ability to identify the cyclic steady states. These oscillating

Abstract
Cytokinesis in fission yeast is controlled by the Septation Initiation Network (SIN), a protein
kinase signaling network using the spindle pole body as scaffold. In order to describe
the qualitative behavior of the system and predict unknown mutant behaviors we decidedto adopt a Boolean modeling approach. In this paper, we report the construction of anextended, Boolean model of the SIN, comprising most SIN components and regulators asindividual, experimentally testable nodes. The model uses CDK activity levels as controlnodes for the simulation of SIN related events in different stages of the cell cycle. Themodel was optimized using single knock-out experiments of known phenotypic effect as atraining set, and was able to correctly predict a double knock-out test set. Moreover, themodel has made in silico predictions that have been validated in vivo , providing new insights
into the regulation and hierarchical organization of the SIN.
Introduction
Schizosaccharomyces pombe , commonly referred as fission yeast, has long been used as a model
organism for the study of conserved, essential functions in the eukaryotic cell. It has proved
highly informative in the study of the cell cycle, particularly the control of the G2/M transition.
Like many somatic higher eukaryotic cells, it divides by binary fission. Cytokinesis in fissionyeast is controlled by the Septation Initiation Network (SIN), a protein kinase signaling net-work, which uses the spindle pole body (SPB; the functional counterpart of the centrosome in
yeast), as a scaffold from which to initiate signaling. Elements of the SIN signaling architecture
have been conserved throughout evolution. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the corresponding
pathway is known as the mitotic exit network (MEN), and controls both cytokinesis and
mitotic exit. In higher eukaryotes the equivalent signaling network is the hippo pathway, which
regulates cell growth and proliferation [ 1,2].

Abstract
Understanding the etiology of metastasis is very important in clinical perspective, since it is
estimated that metastasis accounts for 90% of cancer patient mortality. Metastasis resultsfrom a sequence of multiple steps including invasion and migration. The early stages ofmetastasis are tightly controlled in normal cells and can be drastically affected by malignantmutations; therefore, they might constitute the principal determinants of the overall meta-
static rate even if the later stages take long to occur. To elucidate the role of individual muta-
tions or their combinations affecting the metastatic development, a logical model has beenconstructed that recapitulates published experimental results of known gene perturbationson local invasion and migration processes, and predict the effect of not yet experimentallyassessed mutations. The model has been validated using experimental data on transcrip-tome dynamics following TGF- β-dependent induction of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transi-
tion in lung cancer cell lines. A method to associate gene expression profiles with differentstable state solutions of the logical model has been developed for that purpose. In addition,we have systematically predicted alleviating (masking) and synergistic pairwise geneticinteractions between the genes composing the model with respect to the probability ofacquiring the metastatic phenotype. We focused on several unexpected synergistic geneticinteractions leading to theoretically very high metastasis probability. Among them, the syn-ergistic combination of Notch overexpression and p53 deletion shows one of the strongesteffects, which is in agreement with a recent published experiment in a mouse model of gutcancer. The mathematical model can recapitulate experimental mutations in both cell lineand mouse models. Furthermore, the model predicts new gene perturbations that affect theearly steps of metastasis underlying potential intervention points for innovative therapeuticstrategies in oncology.

Author Summary
We provide here a logical model that proposes gene/pathway candidates that could abro-
gate metastasis. The model explores the mechanisms and interplays between pathwaysthat are involved in the process, identifies the main players in these mechanisms and gives
some insight on how the pathways could be altered. The model reproduces phenotypes of
published experimental results such as the double mutant Notch
+/+/p53-/-. We have also
developed two methods: (1) to predict genetic interactions and (2) to match transcrip-
tomics data to the attractors of a logical model and validate the model on cell line
experiments.
Introduction
Understanding the etiology of metastasis is very important in clinical perspective. Despite theprogress with treatment of the primary tumours, the chances of survival for a patient decreasetremendously once metastases have developed [ 1]. It is estimated that metastasis accounts for
90% of cancer patient mortality [ 2]. It is now understood that the metastatic process follows a
sequence of multiple steps, each being characterised by a small probability of success: 1) infil-tration of tumour cells into the adjacent tissue, 2) migration of tumour cells towards vessels, 3)intravasation of tumour cells by breaching through the endothelial monolayer, 4) travelling in
the circulatory or in the lymphoid system, 5) extravasation when circulating tumour cells re-
enter a distant tissue, and 6) colonisation and proliferation in distant organs [ 3]. The early
stages of invasion and migration are tightly controlled in normal cells and can be drastically
affected by malignant mutations. It has been shown indeed that primary and secondary
tumours have a common gene signature [ 4] that mediates the initial stages of metastasis while
extravasation and colony formation by a (tumour) cell does not require malignant gene alter-
ations [ 5], supporting the idea that the later stages of metastasis are affected by the anatomical
architecture of the vascular system [ 6].
Here, we focus on the ability of cancer cells to infiltrate and migrate into the surrounding
tissue. The first step towards the formation of secondary tumours is acquiring the ability to
migrate. In order to gain motile capacity, epithelial cells need to change their morphology
through Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process which occurs during develop-ment (EMT type 1), wound healing (EMT type 2) and under pathological conditions such as
cancer (EMT type 3) [ 7,8]. EMT type 3 is characterised by both loss of E-cadherin ( cdh1) and
invasive properties at the invasive front of the tumour [ 9]. Gene expression of E-cadherin is
inhibited by the transcription factors Snai1/2, Zeb1/2 and Twist1, while gene expression of N-
cadherin ( cdh2) is induced by the same transcription factors [ 8,10,11]. These transcription
factors activate other genes that initiate EMT [ 11–13] and are induced by several signalling
pathways including TGF- β, NF- κB, Wnt and Notch pathways [ 8,14,15]. On the contrary, the
transcription factor p53 has been shown to inhibit EMT via degradation of Snai2 [ 16]; how-
ever, a p53 loss of function (LoF) alone is not sufficient to induce EMT [ 17]. After the switch of
E-cadherin to N-cadherin expression, the cell-cell contacts are weakened [ 18,19] and cancer
cells can pass the basal membrane to infiltrate the surrounding tissue [ 20]. The process of local
invasion can be active since tumour cells can secrete Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) that
dissolve the lamina propria [ 21]. MMPs are also able to digest other components of the extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) and thereby to release growth factors and cytokines that are attached to
the ECM [ 21,22] which in turn activate the tumour cell ’s ability to propagate the dissolvement
of the lamina propria. Finally, after dissolving the lamina propria and invading the (local)

stroma, cancer cells can migrate to distant sites by intravasation and extravasation of the vascu-
lar system [ 2]. To gain insight in the regulation of the metastatic process, several groups have
developed mathematical models of various aspects of it [ 23–29](S1 Text ).
Our aim is to understand the role of gene alterations in the development of metastasis. In
many (experimental or in silico ) models, EMT is described as a very important step in acquir-
ing metastasis and even considered to be synonymous to appearance of metastasis [ 30–32].
Due to EMT role in metastasis, much research has been performed to elucidate its regulation.The regulation of EMT is known to be complex and simple intuition is not sufficient to com-
prehend how genetic alterations (mutations and copy number variations) affect it. Logical
modelling can give qualitative insight on how they could affect EMT and subsequentlymetastasis.
Previously, we have constructed a detailed map of molecular interactions involved in EMT
regulation which is freely available at [ 33], and based on its structural analysis, we hypothesized
a simple qualitative mechanism of EMT induction through upregulation of Notch and simulta-
neously deletion of p53. This prediction has been experimentally validated in a mouse model of
colon carcinoma [ 31].
In the present study, we significantly extend the biological context and provide a mathemat-
ical framework for the description of the necessary conditions for having metastasis, going
beyond the regulation of EMT only. We take into consideration the gained motility and ability
to invade as determinants of the metastatic process. For this purpose we largely extended andre-designed the signalling network including more molecular players and phenotypes, and
translated the network into a formal mathematical model, allowing prediction of the metastasis
probability and the systematic analysis of mutant properties. Therefore, this work represents asignificant progress with respect to the previous results, allowing reconsideration of the qualita-
tive hypothesis suggested before using a formal mathematical modelling approach.
First, we introduce a logical model that recapitulates the molecular biology of the early steps
in metastasis. The construction of the influence network and the choice of the logical rules areboth based on knowledge derived from scientific articles. The final readouts of the model are
the phenotype variables CellCycleArrest ,Apoptosis and the aggregated phenotype Metastasis
that combines the phenotypes EMT ,Invasion andMigration .
We have chosen those final read-outs, as we believe that a metastatic phenotype depends on
the occurrence of EMT, invasion and migration. In addition, apoptosis is of importance to the
system as during healthy conditions, the cells undergo apoptosis when the cells detach fromthe basal membrane [ 34]. Suppressing apoptosis during migration is a required key feature.
Our interest in cell cycle arrest is due to results of the mouse model [ 31] that show decreased
proliferation. We try to model this feature in our logical model by looking at the regulation ofcell cycle arrest. We did not focus on other phenotypes (or cancer hallmarks) such as prolifera-
tion explicitly, senescence, or angiogenesis. These are often considered in cancer studies but
they were out of the scope of this work, which focused on depicting early invasion modes andnot specifically on how tumour growth is regulated. The model inputs have been selected torepresent external signals necessary for the metastasis initiation pathways. The Boolean model
that we show here describes a possible regulation of the metastatic potential of a single tumour
cell and not of multiple cells or a tissue.
We provide a simplified version of the model where some genes are grouped into modules
(or pathways) allowing an analysis based on pathways rather than individual genes. Both ver-
sions of the models are validated by reproducing the phenotypic read-outs of published experi-mental mouse and cell line models.
We then analyse the two models and formulate several types of predictions: at the level of
individual genes, e.g. exploring the individual role of each EMT inducer in metastasis; and at
Modelling of Metastasis Process

the level of pathways, e.g. investigating the functional role of each pathway in triggering metas-
tasis. The logical models can suggest a systematic mechanistic explanation for the majority of
experimentally validated mutations on the local invasion and migration processes. Moreover,we were able to establish a link between the solutions of the mathematical model and the geneexpression data from cell lines in which EMT was transiently induced. In addition, we have
applied this method to the analysis of transcriptomes of tumour biopsies.
Lastly, we investigate how genetic interactions between different gene mutations can affect
the probability of reaching a metastatic outcome. Our analysis predicts the effect of single
mutations and the genetic interactions between two single mutations with respect to several
cellular phenotypes. Our model proves an exceptionally efficient synergetic effect of increasedactivity of Notch in combination with a decreased activity of p53 on metastasis in accordance
with our previous work [ 31].
Materials and Methods
The influence network
The construction of the influence network is based on scientific articles that describe the inter-
actions between nodes of the model. We first selected the main genes or proteins that may con-
tribute to activating EMT, regulating early invasion and triggering metastasis. We then
searched for experimentally proven physical interactions that would link all these players, andsimplified the detailed mechanisms into an influence network. For example, it has been shown
experimentally that AKT protein phosphorylates and stabilises MDM2, which in turn inhibits
p53 by forming a complex, leading to protein degradation of p53. We simplified the biochemi-cal reactions by a negative influence from AKT to p53. The influence network is then translated
into a mathematical model using Boolean formalism (see below for details). We verified the
coherence of the network by comparing the outcome of the perturbed model to the observedphenotypes of mutants found in the literature. The final model is the result of several iterationsthat led to the accurate description of most of the published mutants related to the genes
included in our model. Once the model was able to reproduce most of the published mutant
experiments, we simulated mutants and conditions not yet assessed experimentally and pre-dicted the outcome.
The Boolean formalism
From the influence network recapitulating known facts about the processes, we develop a math-
ematical model based on the Boolean formalism. To do so, we associate to a node of the influ-
ence network a corresponding Boolean variable . The variables can take two values: 0 for absent
or inactive (OFF), and 1 for present or active (ON). The variables change their value according
to a logical rule assigned to them. The state of a variable will thus depend on its logical rule ,
which is based on logical statements, i.e., on a function of the node regulators linked with logi-cal connectors AND (also denoted as &), OR (|) and NOT (!). A state of the model corresponds
to a vector of all variable states. All possible model states are connected into a transition graph
where the nodes are model states and the edges correspond to possible transitions from onemodel state to another. The transition graph is based on asynchronous update, i.e., each vari-able in the model state is updated one at a time as opposed to all together in the synchronous
update strategy. Attractors of the model refer to long-term asymptotic behaviours of the sys-
tem. Two types of attractors are identified: stable states , when the system has reached a model
state whose successor in the transition graph is itself; and cyclic attractors , when trajectories in
the transition graph lead to a group of model states that are cycling. In this model, no cyclic
attractors were found for the wild type case. However, we do not guarantee the non-existence
Modelling of Metastasis Process
PLOS Computational Biology | DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004571 November 3, 2015 4 / 29
of cyclic attractors in some of the perturbed cases, as perturbations of the model may create
new dynamics.
The logical rules
A logical rule is written for each variable of the model, corresponding to a node in the influencenetwork, in order to define how its status evolves (ON or OFF). In this rule, the variables of the
input nodes are linked by logical connectors according to what is known about their combinedactivities. There are several cases to consider: (1) The simplest logical rule that can be assigned
is when a variable depends on the activity of a single input: for instance, the transcription factor
Twist induces the transcription of the cdh2 gene (see Table 1 ); (2) In the case of an input that
has a negative effect on the activity of its target, the Boolean operator “NOT ”or“!”is used:
EMT is, for example, activated by CDH2 but inactivated by CDH1, thus for EMT to be activate,
CDH1 should be OFF and CDH2 should be ON. The complete logical rule for the activation ofEMT will be EMT = 1 (ON) if CDH2 &! CDH1 (see Table 1 ); (3) In some cases, a gene can be
activated by two independent genes reflecting two different conditions and thus inputs are

Computing phenotype probabilities using MaBoSS
MaBoSS is a C++ software for simulating continuous/discrete time Markov processes, defined
on the state transition graph describing the dynamics of a Boolean network. The rates up
(change from OFF to ON) and down (from ON to OFF) for each node are explicitly providedin the MaBoSS configuration file together with logical functions, which allows working with
physical time explicitly. All rates are set to be 1 in this model since it is difficult to estimate
them from available experimental facts. Probabilities to reach a phenotype are computed as theprobability for the phenotype variable to have the value ON, by simulating random walks onthe probabilistic state transition graph. The probabilities for the selected outputs are reported
for each mutant based on predefined initial conditions (which can be all random). Since a state
in the state transition graph can combine the activation of several phenotype variables, not allphenotype probabilities appear to be mutually exclusive. For example, Apoptosis phenotype
variable activation is always accompanied by activation of CellCycleArrest phenotype variable
(because p53 is a transcription factor of p21, responsible for cell cycle arrest, and the miRNAs,activated by the p53 and its family members, lead to a cell cycle arrest), and activation of the
Metastasis phenotype variable is only possible when all three EMT ,Invasion andMigration
phenotype variables are activated.
With MaBoSS, we can predict an increase or decrease of a phenotype probability when the
model variables are altered, which may correspond to the effect of particular mutants or drug
treatments. If mutation A increases the Apoptosis probability when compared to the Apoptosis
probability in wild type, we conclude that mutant A is advantageous for apoptosis. All modelsare available in MaBoSS format in S1 File .
Module activity
The pathway activity (synonymously, module activity) score in a tumour sample is defined as
the contribution of this sample into the first principal component computed for all samples on
the set of the module target genes, as it was done in [ 35]. This way, we test target gene sets
selected from MSigDB [ 36] and KEGG [ 37] databases together with few tens of gene sets
assembled by us from external sources. The gene lists for each module is provided in S5 Table .
Differential activity score of each module was estimated by t-test between metastatic and non-
metastatic groups and significantly active/inactive modules were selected according to p-value<0.05 condition.
Transcriptomics data for tumour samples
We conducted our study on the publicly available data of human colon cancer from TCGA
described in [ 38]. By excluding rectal cancers from the original dataset, the remaining 105
tumour samples were included in our analysis, classified into two groups ( ‘metastatic ’M1 = 17
tumours and ‘non-metastatic ’M0 = 88 tumours) according to clinical information about
metastasis appearance during cancer progression.

Transcriptomics data for cell lines
We used gene expression data generated from A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line that was
treated with TGF- β1 ligand at eight different time points [ 39]. In short, gene expression was
measured for three replicates at each time point using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus2.0 Array. For more information about treatment and growth protocols see [ 40].
Matching transcriptomics data to logical steady states on EMT-induced
cancer cell lines
We followed the following six steps to link transcriptome data to the stable states of the model
(described in detail in S2 Text ): (1) We first matched the genes of the model with their HUGO
names. For phenotypes such as Apoptosis ,Migration orInvasion , the genes coding for CASP9,
CDC42, and MMP2 were used as biomarkers, respectively. These readouts were selected as themost representative of the process; they were chosen based on the changes of the expression of
a list of candidate genes we explored throughout the experiments. (2) We averaged the genes
over the 3 replicates for time point T0 (initiation of experiment with no TGF- β), for T8 (identi-
fied as the beginning of EMT), for T24 (EMT in process) and for T72 (last point). (3) Using
several methods (binarization algorithms available in [ 41]), we identified a threshold of expres-
sion and binarized the data accordingly. Among our list of genes, only 11 of them have signifi-cant expression dynamics along the experiment: cdh1,cdh2,ctnnb1 ,egfr,mapk1 ,mmp2 ,
smad3 ,snai2 ,tgfb1 ,vimandzeb1. The other genes were either always ON or always OFF
throughout the 72 hours of experiments because the expression is either above or below thethreshold we set. (4) We associated a label (phenotype) to the 9 stable states of the logical
model based on the activity status of the phenotype variable. (5) The similarity matrix was
computed according to the following rule: for each stable state and for each time point, if agene is ON (= 1) or OFF (= 0) in both the vector of discretized expression data and the vectorof the stable state, we set the entry in the similarity matrix to 1, otherwise, it is set to 0. (6) For
each time point and each stable state, we then summed up the corresponding similarity matrix
row, and set an expression-based phenotypic (EBP) score for each stable state. The highest EBPscore for each time point corresponds to the phenotype that is the closest to the studied sample
and is representative of the status of the cells.
Non-linear principal component analysis by elastic maps method
The non-linear principal manifold was constructed for the distribution of all single and double
mutants of the model in the space of computed model phenotype probabilities, using elasticmaps method and ViDaExpert software [ 42–44]. We preferred using a non-linear version of
principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualisation in this case, because it is known to
better preserve the local neighbourhood distance relations and allows more informative visualestimation of clusters compared to the linear PCA of the same dimension [ 42]. For data analy-
sis, only those “mixed ”phenotypes were selected whose probability expectation over the whole
set of single and double mutants was more than 1%. It resulted in a set of 1059 single and dou-
ble mutants embedded into 6-dimensional space of phenotype probabilities for which the prin-cipal manifold was computed.
Synthetic interactions with respect to metastatic phenotype
The results of double mutants were used to quantify the level of epistasis between two model
gene defects (resulting either from gain-of-function mutation of a gene or from its knock-out
or loss-of-function mutation) with respect to metastatic phenotype. The level of epistasis was

quantified using the simplest multiplicative null model applied for the event of not having
metastasis: ε= (1-p 12)-(1-p 1)(1-p 2), where p 1and p 2are the probabilities of having metastasis
in single mutants, and p 12was the probability of having metastasis in the double mutant.
Therefore, negative values of the epistasis score E correspond to synergistic interactions whentwo gene defects amplify each other ’s effect stronger than expected in the multiplicative model.
On the contrary, positive values correspond to alleviating effect, when the effect of one gene
defect could be masked (sometimes, even reduced to zero) by the second mutation. For geneticnetwork visualisation, we kept the most significant interactions with ε<-0.2 or ε>0.3 values.
These thresholds were chosen because at these levels we observed gaps in the distribution of ε
values. The complete list of interactions together with p
1,p2,p12andεvalues can be found as a

Construction of an influence network regulating EMT, invasion and cell
migration
Mesenchymal cells are characterised by their increased motility, loss of cdh1 (coding for E-cad-
herin) expression, increased expression of cdh2 (coding for N-cadherin), and presence of
vimentin (Vim) [ 7,10,45]. The EMT program can be initiated by the transcription factors
snai1 ,snai2 ,zeb1,zeb2 andtwist1 . They are considered to be the core regulators of EMT as
each has been shown to down-regulate cdh1 [46–50]. In turn, the genes coding for these core
EMT-regulators are subjected to regulation by other signalling pathways. The TGF- βpathway
has been reported to be able to induce EMT [ 7,51], but other pathways are also involved in
EMT including Wnt, Notch and PI3K-AKT pathways [ 52–56].
Furthermore, microRNAs regulate the Snai and Zeb family members. For example, miR200
targets snai2 ,zeb1 andzeb2 mRNA [ 57–59] whereas miR203 targets snai1 andzeb2 mRNA
[59], and miR34 targets snai1 mRNA [ 60]. The transcription of these microRNAs is under the
control of p53 [ 61–64]. The miR200 expression can also be induced by p63 and p73 proteins,
while miR34 is only induced by p73 but is down-regulated by p63 [ 65–67]. The microRNAs
can be down-regulated by the EMT-inducers Snai1/2, and Zeb1/2 [ 59,60,68]. Note that the
proteins p63 and p73 have been identified as members of the p53 protein family since their
amino acid sequences share high similarity with that of p53 [ 69]. They are able to bind to the
promoters of the majority of the p53-target genes and therefore have overlapping functions incell cycle arrest and apoptosis [ 70,71]. The p53-family members are involved in cross-talks
with Notch and AKT pathways: p63 protein is inhibited by the Notch pathway, p53 by AKT1
and AKT2 [ 69,72–76] while p73 is down-regulated by p53 (itself negatively regulated by p73),
AKT1, AKT2, and Zeb1 [ 69,72,77].
The PI3K-AKT pathway has been considered to be important in evading apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest by modulating the TRAIL pathway, down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes andphosphorylating p21 [ 78–80]. More recently, AKT has been assigned additional but important
roles in the development of metastasis. AKT1 suppresses apoptosis upon cell detachment
(anoikis) of the ECM [ 34]. The different isoforms of AKT seem to have opposing roles in the
regulation of microRNAs: AKT1 inhibits miR34 and activates miR200 while AKT2 inhibitsmiR200 and activates miR34 [ 81]. Another opposing role for both AKT isoforms has been
found in migration. AKT1 inhibits migration by phosphorylating the protein Palladin; phos-
phorylated Palladin forms actin bundles that inhibit migration. AKT2 increases the proteinPalladin stability and upregulates β1-integrins stimulating migration [ 82,83] or by inhibiting
TSC2 that, in turn, activates RHO [ 84]. Furthermore, AKT1 inhibits cell cycle arrest while
AKT2 activates it [ 85,86] (all these effects are shown implicitly in Fig 1A ).

Extracellular stimuli are also included in the logical model. Growth factors (GF) are soluble
ligands that can be excreted locally or from longer distances and are able to activate the
PI3K-AKT, and MAPK pathways [ 87,88]. Another extracellular stimulus might be the extracel-
lular microenvironment (ECMicroenv) with components that are not soluble including theextracellular matrix. The ligands for the TGF- βpathway can be imbedded in the extracellular
matrix [ 89–91] and the ligands for the Notch pathway are transmembrane proteins from adja-
cent neighbouring cells [ 92,93].
These mechanisms are depicted in an influence network ( Fig 1A ). The network is composed
of nodes and edges, where some nodes represent biochemical species (proteins, miRNAs, pro-
cesses, etc.) and others represent phenotypes, and edges represent activating (green) or inhibi-tory (red) influences of one node onto other node. Each edge is annotated and supported by
experimental papers (see S1 Table ). Throughout the article, we will use the general term “phe-
notypes ”to refer to “phenotype variables ”, which correspond to the four outputs: CellCycleArr-
est,Apoptosis ,Metastasis (depending on EMT ,Migration andInvasion ), and Homeostatic
State (HS) as presented below.
Mathematical modelling of the influence network
Construction of a logical model and its stable states. The network of Fig 1A is translated
into a logical model using GINsim software [ 94]: a logical rule is assigned to each node of the
network ( Table 1 , and Materials and Methods ). Once the logical rules are set for each node of
the network, the Boolean model can simulate solutions or outcomes that correspond to attrac-
tors in the state transition graph (see Materials and Methods for details). The model, for the
wild type condition (i.e. no mutations or gene alterations), counts nine stable states for all com-
binations of inputs ( Table 2 ). To each stable state, a phenotype is assigned based on the genes
that are activated (variable is ON, thus equal to 1). The phenotypes identified are: CellCycleArr-
esttogether with Apoptosis ;CellCycleArrest together with EMT ;Metastasis (depending on three
other processes: EMT ,Migration andInvasion ); and a stable state with only Cdh1 ON. This
state corresponds to a state where metastasis is inhibited by Cdh1 activity. We refer to it as thehomeostatic state (HS). It is a particular state of an epithelial cell that is not explicitly repre-sented as a phenotype variable in this mathematical model. Four out of the nine stable states
lead to Apoptosis , in the presence of DNA damage and absence of growth factors (GF). Two sta-
ble states show an EMT phenotype alone (without inducing Metastasis ). In these stable states,
Invasion andMigration are not activated because TGF- βpathway is not initially ON. The last
two stable states lead to Metastasis in the presence of growth factors. GF activates the ERK path-
way that switches off the p53-family targets and permits the triggering of events leading tometastases. Indeed, several studies have shown the importance of ERK in migration [ 95–97].
Testing robustness of the model with respect to small changes in the logical rules. We
systematically checked the effect of changing the logical operators of the model from “OR ”to
“AND ”, and vice versa, onto the resulting model phenotype probabilities. More specifically, we
generated model variants with one change of a logical operator in one logical rule, two changes
in the same logical rule, or one single change in two different logical rules, leaving the rest oflogical operators the same as in the wild type model. Therefore, we considered all model vari-ants different from the wild type model by at most two different logical operators. The analysis
resulted in 8001 model variants.
We first show that the distributions of phenotype probabilities after these changes are con-
centrated around the wild type probability values ( S6 Fig ).
Metastasis appeared to be the least robust model phenotype, which confirms the fact that
there are some necessary conditions that need to be met to lead to metastasis (illustrated by
Modelling of Metastasis Process

AND operators in the logical rules). If approximately 49% of changes in the logical rules have
minor or no effect onto the Metastasis phenotype probability, some modifications in some
rules changed the Metastasis phenotype to zero (implicating p63, p73, AKT1 variables of the
model and, to a lesser extent, CTNNB1, miR34, p53). Most of the rules that concern these vari-ables are indeed more stringent. A change from an AND gate to an OR gate for the case of p63or AKT1 has an important impact on the metastasis process. For instance, if p63 is more pres-
ent, because it is inactivated with fewer constraints, it can block more easily migration and
thus, metastasis. These logical rules should be considered more carefully than the othersbecause a mistake in defining these rules can have more drastic effects on the model properties
than any other modifications.
We also performed a reproducibility analysis of individual logical stable states in the models
differing from the wild type model by one or two changes in the same logical rule or one
change in two logical rules as presented above. The wild type model is characterized by nineTable 2. The nine stable states of the mathematical model. The label of the columns corresponds to the phenotypic outputs.

stable states, including the homeostatic state (HS) (see Table 2 ). 8001 model variants men-
tioned above are characterized by 68726 stable states counted in total. Hence, in average, each
model variant is characterized by 8 or 9 stable states, which might be different from the wildtype model. In total, we have counted 1176 distinct stable states in all the 8001 model variants,observed with different frequencies ( S6 Table ). The nine stable states of the wild type model are
robustly reproducible, being the most frequently observed stable states, and accounting for
59% of all observed stable states in different model variants. Another 13% of observed stablestates differ from one of the wild type stable states by only one change in the Boolean variable
values (DIST_TO_WT = 1). Some modifications of logical rules for CTNNB1 or NICD lead to
very rarely observed atypical but very different from the wild type stable states (DIS-T_TO_WT = 12). Based on all these analyses, we conclude that the nine wild type model stable
states are robust and “typical ”with respect to moderate random modifications of the logical
rules and fragile to few targeted modifications.
Model reduction into a modular network. To make our modelling more insightful, we
reduced the complexity by lumping variables into modules corresponding to signalling path-
ways: the TGF- βpathway (TGFb_pthw consisting of TGFbeta, SMAD), Notch pathway
(Notch_pthw, includes activated Notch intracellular domain (NICD), the WNT pathway(WNT_pthw consisting of DKK1, CTNNB1), the p53 pathway (p53, consisting of p53), the
p63-p73 proteins (p63_73 consisting of p63 and p73), the miRNA (miR34, miR200, miR203),
the EMT regulators (EMT_reg including Twist1, Zeb1, Zeb2, Snai1, Snai2, Cdh2, Vim), E-cadherin (Ecadh with Cdh1), growth factors (GF), the ERK pathway (ERK_pthw: ERK), p21 is
included in the CellCycleArrest phenotype, AKT1 module and AKT2 module. In the reduced
model ( Fig 1B ), the inputs (ECMicroenv and DNAdamage) and (final and intermediate) out-
puts ( Migration ,Invasion ,Metastasis , and Apoptosi s) are conserved. The reduced model pro-
duces the same stable states (for the wild type conditions) as those of the initial model ( Fig 1A ,
seeS4 Text ).
Validation of the Boolean model. We simulated the genetic perturbations that corre-
spond to published experimental settings and verified that the stable states of the mathematical
model correspond to the experimental observations. An overexpression or gain of function
(GoF) of a gene is simulated by forcing the value of the node to ON and a deletion or loss offunction (LoF) by forcing the value of the node to OFF. We first simulated not only previously
described mutants but also mutants that have not yet been experimentally validated (see S4
Table ). The mathematical model is able to reproduce the experimental results of almost all
described mutants. In few cases, there is a discrepancy between the mathematical and the bio-
logical model due to three reasons described below: 1) Metastasis in our logical model is
defined as colonisation of tumour cells into distant organs through migration in the systemicand/or lymphatic vessels. A limitation of the cell line model is that a metastatic output cannot
be measured. 2) Dosage-dependent effects cannot be modelled using the logical formalism. For
example, our model predicts metastasis in a kras GoF while the mouse model does not develop
distant metastatic tumours. A possibility for the difference is that in the mouse model the wildtype kras allele is still present (a heterozygous mutation) while in our model KRAS mutant is
homozygous. It has been reported that the remaining wild type kras gene has still tumour sup-
pressive properties: it can reduce tumourigenesis in lung [ 98,99] and in colon cancer cell line
by inhibiting proliferation [ 100]. Other studies in cancer cell lines that are heterozygous for
kras mutation showed that the wild type kras gene in those cell lines decreased the migration
and colonisation capacity [ 101,102] suggesting a dose-dependent effect [ 103]. This might indi-
cate that mouse mutants homozygous for kras mutation may develop distant metastasis as pre-
dicted by our mathematical model. 3) Simulating mutations of genes that are not explicitly
represented as a node in the model has its limitations because the network does not describe

The connection between inflammation and tumourigenesis has been well established. However, the
detailed molecular mechanism underlying inflammation-associated tumourigenesis remains unknown
because this process involves a complex interplay between immune microenvironments and epithelial
cells. To obtain a more systematic understanding of inflammation-associated tumourigenesis as well as to identify novel therapeutic approaches, we constructed a knowledge-based network
describing the development of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) by integrating the extracellular
microenvironment and intracellular signalling pathways. Dynamic simulations of the CAC network revealed a core network module, including P53, MDM2, and AKT, that may govern the malignant
transformation of colon epithelial cells in a pro-tumor inflammatory microenvironment. Furthermore,
in silico mutation studies and experimental validations led to a novel finding that concurrently targeting ceramide and PI3K/AKT pathway by chemical probes or marketed drugs achieves
synergistic anti-cancer effects. Overall, our network model can guide further mechanistic studies on
CAC and provide new insights into the design of combinatorial cancer therapies in a rational manner.
Inflammation and cancer are closely correlated1. The link between inflammation and cancer development
is especially strong in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), which is one of the most common malig-
nancies and a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide2. An increased risk of CRC development has
been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)3, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs are effective in preventing colon neoplasia4. Dysregulations of the immune microenvironment and
several inflammation-related signalling pathways, such as TNF-α /NF-κ B, IL-6/STAT3, COX-2/PGE2 and
TGF-β /SMADs, have been shown to contribute to the development of inflammation-associated cancers5–9.
In addition, emerging evidence suggests a possible link between the inflammatory microenvironment and cancer therapy resistance
10. Nevertheless, most of these studies have focused on a single molecule
or pathway. Information on how the immune microenvironment affects cancer development and how the inflammatory signalling pathways crosstalk with classical tumourigenesis pathways is still lacking.
Therefore, to gain a holistic view on the mechanism of the development of inflammation-associated

cellular signalling should be considered as a complex system and studied in a more systematic manner.
To date, network modelling has been successfully used in the study of complex biological systems11–13.
Existing knowledge of individual pathways can be incorporated into an integrated biological network,
which could be further converted into a dynamic and predictive model using various mathematical
modelling techniques. Boolean network models are the simplest discrete mathematical models and assume only two states (ON or OFF) for each node in the biological networks. Dynamic Boolean net-
work models have been successfully applied in studies of complex diseases and biological processes,
such as survival signalling of T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukaemia
13, hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF)-induced keratinocyte migration12, immune cell differentiation14, and cell cycle regulation11.
Boolean network models have also been used to integrate microenvironment components and signaling
pathways to study cancer biology and predict therapy outcomes15,16. Boolean network models are espe-
cially useful when the biochemical kinetic parameters of a certain biological process are unknown or the networks contain different species of biological entities, such as proteins, small molecules, mRNAs,
and even cells.
In the present work, we constructed a Boolean network model describing the growth and survival
of preneoplastic epithelial cells in an inflammatory microenvironment, aiming to systematically study the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). The ability of the network model to recapture experimental observations validated its rationality. The detailed
dynamic properties of the CAC network model under normal or dysregulated inflammatory microen-
vironments were characterised. Our simulation results suggest the constant activation of the node rep-resenting dendritic cells (DC) creates a pro-tumor inflammatory microenvironment. Attractor analysis identified a key regulatory module involving P53, MDM2, GSK3-β  and AKT signalling that may govern
the malignant transformation of epithelial cells in this pro-tumour inflammatory microenvironment. Furthermore, in silico  perturbation studies and experimental validations led us to identify several novel
drug combinations that could significantly inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of tumour cells
under an inflammatory stimulus. Taken together, our study integrates the extracellular microenviron-
ment and intracellular signalling to provide a holistic view of inflammation-associated cancer. Our dry lab model and experimental findings can accelerate mechanistic studies and the development of novel
combinatorial therapies for CAC and other inflammation-associated cancers.
Results
The CAC network representing intestinal epithelial cells in an immune microenvironment. By
performing extensive literature and database searches, we constructed a knowledge-based network link-ing inflammatory signalling and cell proliferation and survival pathways of premalignant intestinal epi-
thelial cells (IECs) (Fig.  1). We designated this network model as the CAC network. The entire CAC network incorporates 70 nodes and 153 edges. It can be divided into two parts: the IEC part, which
contains nodes representing intracellular signalling components, and the immune microenvironment
part, which contains the nodes representing immune cells, cytokines and chemokines. We also mod-elled ‘Proliferation’ and ‘ Apoptosis’ as two output nodes to summarise the final biological effects of the
inflammatory signalling. The nomenclature of all the nodes in the network is provided in Supplementary
Table S1, and the biological description of the CAC network is presented in Supplementary Methods. The topology properties of the CAC network are summarised in Supplementary Table S2. The properties of the CAC network resemble those of general biological networks, which are characterised by higher
clustering coefficient than random networks (Supplementary Table S2) and approximate power-law dis-
tributions of node degrees (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, as the size of the CAC network is relatively small and its topology has been simplified, the quantitative characterisation of the network topology is
not very informative and therefore we are focusing more on the dynamic properties of the CAC network.
To further characterise the dynamic cell signaling events, we translated the CAC network into a
Boolean network model, in which the network node was described by one of two possible states: ON or OFF. The ON state can be biologically interpreted as the activation of a gene/protein, or the production
of a small molecule whereas the OFF state means the inhibition of a gene/protein or the absence of a small molecule. The regulatory relationships between upstream nodes (regulators) and downstream
nodes (targets) are expressed by the logical operators AND, OR and NOT. The Boolean logical rules that
govern the states of all these nodes are listed in Supplementary Table S3 and a thorough justification of these rules is provided in Supplementary Methods. Preliminary robustness tests suggested the CAC
network model was robust to small amounts of noise (Supplementary Fig. S2), which is in accord with
the general feature of biological networks.
Dynamics of the CAC network model in a normal immune microenvironment. We first exam-
ined whether our CAC network model could reproduce the experimental observations of the IECs in
a normal immune microenvironment, including a non-inflammatory microenvironment and a normal
inflammatory response. To simulate a non-inflammatory microenvironment, we fixed the states of all the nodes in the immune microenvironment (cyan nodes in Fig. 1) to OFF to represent the absence of
inflammatory factors. We also fixed the state of the APC node to ON to represent premalignant IECs, in
which the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is constantly expressed and activated to suppress

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739β -catenin signalling17. Subsequently, we iterated the model using the general asynchronous (GA) updat-
ing method from a large number (5,000) of randomly selected initial states. When simulating a dynamic
Boolean model using asynchronous updating methods, the frequency of a node being in the ON state
(activation frequency) can give qualitative indications of the probability that a certain signaling compo-nent or a biological process being activated in a real cell. The activation frequencies of the two output
nodes – Proliferation and Apoptosis at each simulation step were recorded to evaluate the impact of the
microenvironment on cell survival states (Fig.  2a). In order to facilitate the comparison between our simulation results and previous experimental observations, we also recorded the activation frequen-
cies of three nodes representing STAT3, NF-κ B and β -catenin transcription factors (STAT3, NFKB and
BCATENIN), whose activations have been considered as hallmarks of CAC
17–20. After 1000 steps of
iteration, the Proliferation node rested in the OFF state, suggesting the IECs were unable to proliferate under non-inflammatory microenvironment. STAT3, NFKB and BCATENIN also stabilised in the OFF
state within 1500 steps (Fig.  2a). By contrast, the steady activation frequency of the Apoptosis node was approximately 30%, indicating that a fraction of the epithelial cells could undergo apoptosis under
non-inflammatory conditions. We then performed network reduction of the CAC network under the
non-inflammatory microenvironment and identified its attractors (Supplementary Table S4). Attractors present the long-term behaviours of a Boolean model and can be regarded as potential stable states of
a cell under certain conditions
21. In consistence with the numerical simulation results from random
initial states, two attractors, which represents the resting and apoptosis states of epithelial cells can be identified under this condition. These simulation results can be biologically interpreted as the tendency
of IECs to remain in a resting state without inflammatory signals, but they also possess the capability Figure 1. Topology of the CAC network. Five colours were used to represent the nodes with different
biological functions. The nodes in cyan belong to the extracellular immune microenvironment; the nodes
in orange primarily participate in inflammatory signalling; the nodes in green primarily mediate cell
proliferation; and the nodes in red regulate cell survival. The two purple nodes represent the output effects
(proliferation and apoptosis) of the network model. An arrowhead represents positive regulation (activation or upregulation), whereas a diamond indicates negative regulation (inhibition or downregulation).

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739to undergo spontaneous apoptosis. Above simulation results are supported by previous findings that
spontaneous apoptosis of the colon epithelium is a crucial mechanism for maintaining the homeostasis
of gastrointestinal tissues22.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are known as the most potent dedicated antigen-presenting cells specialised to
initiate and maintain immunity and tolerance23. Therefore, we next simulated the normal initiation of an
inflammatory response by setting the initial state of DC to the ON state to simulate the transient activa-tion of dendritic cells. Compared with the simulation results in the non-inflammatory microenvironment
(Fig. 2a), the transient activation of DC moderately increased the activation frequency of Proliferation (Fig. 2b), whereas the activation frequency of Apoptosis was unchanged. In accordance, the CAC net-
work under this condition possessed attractors that represent proliferation phenotypes in addition to
apoptosis and resting phenotypes (Supplementary Table S4).The transient activation of DC also activated STAT3, NFKB and BCATENIN, as well as other immune cells with different activation frequencies; how-
ever, none of them exceeded 0.5 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S3). The activation frequencies of the
immune suppressive nodes, such as IL10, was generally higher than that of the pro-inflammatory nodes, such as TNFA and IL6 (Fig. 2c). Therefore, our model suggests that the transient activation of DCs may initiate a controlled inflammatory reaction and eventually lead to an immune suppressive microenviron-
ment, which does not support the uncontrolled growth of epithelial cells. These results are in agreement
with observations that the normal microenvironment of colon mucosa is in an immune suppressive state, even if the colon contains a large amount of microbiota and antigens
24.
Effect of different immune microenvironments on IECs. Because the inflammatory microen-
vironment is a mixture of different types of infiltrated immune cells, we evaluated the effect of differ -
ent immune microenvironments on IECs by iteratively fixing one or a group of immune cell nodes at the ON state to mimic their constant presence in the microenvironment. The activation frequencies of Proliferation, Apoptosis, and different cytokine nodes in the corresponding immune microenvironment
are shown in Table  1. Because there were 63 different combinations, only the combined activations of
immune cell nodes that have additive effects to single activations are shown. We observed that in con-trast to the transient activation of DC, maintaining DC in the ON state permanently, which could be
biologically interpreted as the constant activation of dendritic cells, created the most pro-proliferation
microenvironment, in which the activation of Proliferation significantly increased and the activation of Apoptosis was blocked (line 1). This observation is supported by experimental findings that although the Figure 2. Dynamics of the CAC network model in the non-inflammatory microenvironment.

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739transient activation of DCs initiates a controlled inflammatory reaction24, the sustained activation of DCs
leads to chronic inflammation in IBDs25, which enhances the growth and survival of IECs7,26. In addition
to DC, the constant activation of MAC, CTL or TH1 in the microenvironment could also increase the
activation of Proliferation while decreasing the activation of Apoptosis (lines 2, 4 and 5).
However, constant activation of TREG or TH2 slightly induced the activation of Proliferation but
significantly increased the activation of Apoptosis (lines 3 and 6). Upon TREG activation, we observed increased activation of IL10 and TGFB and decreased activation of TNFA and IL6 (line 3 compared with
lines 1 and 2). This observation is consistent with previous findings in which regulatory T cells were shown to reduce tumour growth in CAC cases by producing immune suppressive cytokines (e.g., IL-10
and TGF-β ) and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α  and IL-6)
27. Interestingly, although
the activation of CTL alone induced the activation of Proliferation but not Apoptosis (line 4), the com-bined activation of CTL and TREG significantly reduced Proliferation and increased Apoptosis, forming
the most anti-tumourigenic microenvironment (line 11). This result reiterates the clinical phenomenon that CTL contributes to intestinal inflammation and promotes tumour growth in CAC cases
28, despite
of previous observations that infiltration of CTL is commonly correlated with favourable prognosis in
sporadic colon cancers29. The effect of combined activation of CTL and TREG on the states of Apoptosis
indicates that the additional activation of Treg cells can restore the cytotoxic function of CTL and there-fore enhance immune surveillance.
We also identified several novel immune cell combinations that exhibited various effects on the states
of Proliferation, Apoptosis and the cytokine nodes (lines 7–10 and lines 12–14), revealing the complex influence of the immune microenvironment on the survival and proliferation of IECs. These predictions
can be useful for rationally designing immune therapies to restore normal microenvironments or for building anti-tumour microenvironments by modulating immune cells.
Dynamics of the CAC network model in a pro-tumour inflammatory microenvironment.
Notably, Proliferation did not reach full activation, even under the strongest tumour-promoting microen-
vironment (fixing DC at ON). This result could be biologically interpreted as a controlled growth of the
premalignant IECs in an inflammatory microenvironment. We then characterised the dynamic prop-erties of the CAC network model under this tumour-promoting microenvironment to understand the
regulatory mechanisms of cellular proliferation and to identify the factors responsible for the malignant
transformation of the IECs. After a transient activation, Apoptosis was eventually stabilised in the OFF state in all simulations, whereas the activation frequency of Proliferation was approximately 0.6 (Fig. 3a).
The activation frequencies of STAT3 and NFKB were significantly increased compared with those in the
non-inflammatory condition and the normal inflammatory response (Fig. 3a compared with Fig. 2a,b), which is consistent with experimental observations that these two transcription factors were highly active DC MAC TREG CTL TH1 TH2 Proliferation Apoptosis TNFA IL6 TGFB IFNG IL10 IL12 IL4

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739under inflammatory stimulus7,30. BCATENIN was partially activated, although we maintained APC in
the ON state. Fixing APC in the OFF state to simulate the inactivation mutation of APC protein led to
the full activation of BCATENIN. However, the activation frequency of Proliferation was not further
increased (Supplementary Fig. S4). Clinical observations have shown that although APC mutations are one of the earliest events in sporadic colorectal cancers and are considered essential for the transition
of preneoplastic cells to aberrant crypt foci and adenoma
17,31, these mutations occur much later in CAC
cases32,33.
To further study the dynamic properties of the CAC network in the pro-tumor inflammatory microen-
vironment, we performed network reduction and analysed the attractor structure of the CAC network
under this pro-tumour microenvironment (fixing DC in the ON state). The first step of network reduc-tion identified 33 nodes that were stabilised either in the ON or OFF state. In particular, the nodes cor -
relating with cell proliferation, such as RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK, and FOS, were stabilised in the ON state. Previous studies have shown that ERK/MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling can be activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines in IBD cases
34 and that they
are over-activated in both sporadic colon cancer and CAC35,36. In addition, Apoptosis and other nodes
correlating with apoptotic cell death, such as BAX, TBID, CERAMIDE, CYTC, CASP3, CASP8, CASP9,
MOMP and PP2A, were all stabilised in the OFF state, indicating the entire apoptosis pathway was blocked
by the pro-tumor inflammatory microenvironment. After removing stabilised nodes, simple intermediate nodes, and nodes with zero out-degrees, the final reduced network comprised 21 nodes and 39 interac-
tions (Fig. 3b). The Boolean rules governing the reduced network are provided in Supplementary Table
S5. We identified three attractors of the reduced CAC network model: a complex attractor (Attractor 1) that contained 48 states, and two cyclic attractors (Attractors 2 and 3) that contained six states each
(Table  2). By analysing the system’s states within these attractors, we found three activation patterns
for each node in the sub-network. One pattern was full activation, in which the node was stabilised at ON in all states within an attractor; another pattern was partial activation, in which the node states oscillated between ON and OFF and half were ON; and the last pattern was inactivation, in which the
node was stabilised at OFF in all states. Nodes STAT3, JAK and SOCS formed a negative feedback loop,
and they oscillated in all the attractors; however, their activation patterns were the same. Therefore, these three nodes were excluded from further activation pattern analysis. Figure 3c shows the different Figure 3. Dynamics of the CAC network model in the pro-tumour inflammatory microenvironment.

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739activation patterns of the nodes within the three attractors. The pro-proliferate nodes AKT, BCATENIN,
CYCLIND1, IKK, JUN and NFKB were all fully activated in Attractor 1, indicating a tendency for the IECs
to undergo proliferation. However, P53 and P21 were partially activated in Attractor 1. Thus, the activation
frequency of Proliferation was then restricted by the partial activation of P21 according to the Boolean function (Proliferation* =  CYCLIND1 and not P21) of the reduced CAC network. Therefore, Attractor
1 represented a limited proliferation state. In Attractor 2, AKT, BCATENIN and CYCLIND1 were fully activated, and P21 was inactivated; thus, this attractor represented a proliferation state. Both CYCLIND1 and P21 were inactivated in Attractor 3; therefore, this attractor represented a resting state. When using
synchronous updating methods, we found the reduced network had 28 attractors, which could also be
grouped into three phenotypic classes: resting, limited proliferation and proliferation (Supplementary Table S6).
By iteratively fixing one node in the sub-network to either an ON or OFF state, we identified a core
regulatory network that governed the behaviour of the CAC network in the pro-tumour environment (Fig.  3d). Fixing AKT or CYCLIND1 in the OFF state could cause all state trajectories to fall into the resting attractor. Fixing GSK3B, P21, P53 or PTEN in the ON state had the same effect on the attractor
landscape. Currently, alteration of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling axis is a well-accepted driving force
in carcinogenesis, and AKT has been shown to be dysregulated in most colon cancers
37,38. Notably, our
model herein emphasised that AKT activation was essential for accessing the attractor representing pro-
liferation under an inflammatory stimulus. In addition, our model suggested that GSK3-β  might play a
tumour suppressor role in CAC by inhibiting CYCLIND1 and MDM2 in the pro-tumor inflammatory
microenvironment (Fig.  3d). Most importantly, we observed that only the permanent inactivation of
P53 or the activation of an endogenous P53 inhibitor, MDM2, could lead all the simulation trajectories
to fall into the proliferation attractor. This effect can be biologically interpreted as a mutation or the constant suppression of P53, endowing IECs with the capability of uncontrolled growth and thereby
initiating malignant transformation. Therefore, the simulation results suggest P53 pathway may act as the
last guard before malignant transition in a strong pro-tumour inflammatory microenvironment, which is supported by the observation that P53 mutation (but not APC mutation) is a common event in the initiation phase of CAC progress
39. The changes of the output effects under various conditions showed
similar trends when different updating methods were used (Supplementary Table S7), indicating the
overall dynamic properties of our Boolean network are not sensitive to the updating methods.
Key nodes regulating malignant transformation revealed by systematic node perturbations.
We subsequently performed a systematic node perturbation analysis on the entire CAC network to iden-tify other nodes that may mediate malignant transformation in an inflammatory microenvironment.
We maintained DC in the ON state to mimic the premalignant IECs in a tumour-promoting microen-
vironment and perturbed the states of other nodes in the CAC network. For the nodes that became
stabilised in either an ON or OFF state, we fixed each node in the opposite of its stabilised state and continued updating other nodes. For the oscillated nodes, we perturbed each node twice by fixing the
node to either ON or OFF. These perturbations mimic the manipulation of biological systems through
genetic or chemical approaches, such as gene knockdown or treating cells with active compounds. We then observed the stabilised activation frequencies of the output nodes, Proliferation and Apoptosis, to evaluate the perturbation effect. Through this method, we identified 36 of 109 perturbations that could
affect the activation of Proliferation or Apoptosis. We manually categorised these perturbations into
pro-proliferative, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptosis groups according to their effects on the states of Proliferation and Apoptosis.
As shown in Fig. 4, the pro-proliferative group contains the perturbations that lead to a high activa-
tion frequency (> 90%) of Proliferation. The perturbed nodes in this group come from four pathways:
the P53 pathway (P53, MDM2), the PI3K/AKT pathway (PI3K, AKT, PTEN, and GSK3B), the NF-κ B
pathway (NFKB, IKK, IKB) and the COX2/PGE2 pathway (PGE2, EP2 and COX2). The P53 node and
PI3K/AKT pathway nodes also exists in the anti-proliferative group when set in the opposite states (Fig.  4). The critical roles of P53, MDM2 and AKT in CAC progress have been revealed by the above
attractor analysis. The aberrant activation of NF-κ B and COX2/PGE2 signalling has also been detected
in most CAC cases

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739nodes (RAS, RAF, MEK and ERK) and the inhibition of IL6 signalling nodes (IL6 and GP130). Previous
findings indicate that ERK MAPKs are the major regulators of proliferation during colon carcinogene-
sis35, and the suppression of the ERK MAPK pathway inhibits proliferation and induce apoptosis of IECs
in an inflammatory microenvironment40. Blocking IL-6 signalling with an anti-interleukin-6 receptor
antibody or inhibiting IL-6 trans -signalling with TGF-β  has also been shown to suppress tumour pro-
gression in colon cancer41. Notably, the perturbations of the nodes that participate in sphingolipid metab-
olism (CERAMIDE, SPHK1) are part of the pro-apoptotic group. A recent finding has demonstrated that SPHK1/S1P signalling plays a crucial role in linking chronic inflammation and CAC and that inhibiting
SPHK1 could effectively reduce CAC development
42.
In all, 29 of 36 predictions made by in silico  perturbations can be supported by previous experi-
mental observations, which validates the rationality of our model (Supplementary Table S8). The per -
turbation analysis also led to the novel prediction that activation of GSK3B, SMAD, ROS, PP2A, ATM, or CERAMIDE could inhibit proliferation or induce apoptosis of preneoplastic IECs in the pro-tumor
inflammatory microenvironment, indicating that these molecules can be potential therapeutic targets for
preventing CAC development.
In silico double perturbation study and experimental validations identify novel drug com-
binations. As both our model and previous experimental studies indicate that P53 is crucial for the
malignant transformation of IECs in an inflammatory microenvironment, we maintained DC in the
ON state and P53 in the OFF state simultaneously to mimic the state of a neoplastically transformed
epithelial cell in a pro-proliferative microenvironment. We subsequently performed perturbation anal-ysis on the CAC network model under this condition to identify potential therapeutic targets for treat-
ment of CAC. In this situation, only 18 of 89 perturbations could lower the activation frequency of
Proliferation by over 50% (Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating that the CAC network in the neoplasti-cally transformed state was more robust than that in the pre-transformed state. Only two perturbations
could induce the activation of Apoptosis: activation of MOMP and activation of CASP3 (Supplementary
Fig. S5). However, MOMP or Caspase3 activation represent the terminal events in apoptotic cell death, and therefore, manipulating these processes therapeutically is impractical. The robustness of the CAC
network model in the P53-inactive state suggested that the single target therapy may be less effective
in killing tumour cells that had previously developed in CAC cases. We further performed double per -
turbations by altering the state of two nodes simultaneously to seek possible combinatorial therapeutic
approaches. We found several combined perturbations that could inhibit proliferation while increasing
apoptosis (Table  3). However, not all of these perturbations are therapeutically accessible because of the lack of modulators, such as small molecule inhibitors. Among the double perturbations, we found
some promising combinations that involve the activation of the CERAMIDE pathway while inhibiting
the PI3K/AKT pathway. The above dynamic analysis indicated that AKT may play an important role in forming the attractor for the proliferation state, and several inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway are
under clinical evaluation
43. Ceramide has also been previously shown to induce apoptosis and to sensitise
tumour cells to radiotherapy44,45. Therefore, these combinations may be more clinically applicable than
other predicted combinations.
We then proceeded to validate the utility of these combinatorial perturbations in HT29 colon cancer
cells, which have a P53 R273H inactivation mutation46. The impact of the inflammatory microenviron-
ment was integrated by constantly exposing cells to the treatment with IL6 plus TNF-α , which resulted
in the activation of STAT3 and NF-κ B signalling (Supplementary Fig. S6a). As predicted, short chain,

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739exerted synergistic effect with the AKT pan-inhibitor MK2206 (Fig. 5a) or PI3Kα /δ  inhibitor GDC0941
(Fig. 5b) on cell viability under several concentrations, indicated by a combination index (CI) less than 1.
To further understand the mechanism of the combinational effect of AKT inhibitors and ceramide,
we extracted the sub-network related to ceramide, the PI3K/AKT pathway and inflammatory activation
from the global CAC network. According to the sub-network shown in Fig. 5c, PI3K/AKT and ceramide
signalling converged on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Ceramide treatment could induce mito-
chondrial apoptosis by directly activating MOMP (mitochondria outer membrane permeabilisation) and PP2A. MOMP could then disrupt the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and mediate the subse-
quent release of death-promoting proteins, such as cytochrome C, whereas PP2A could dephosphorylate
and inactivate the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and partially mediate Akt dephosphorylation. However, when the CERAMIDE node was activated alone, the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was inhibited by activated AKT. AKT activated anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL,
by phosphorylating and inhibiting pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, such as BAD, BIM and BAX.
Through the activation of mTOR, AKT can also inhibit PP2A and prevent the dephosphorylation and inactivation of BCL-2
48. Accordingly, a combination of BCL2 inhibitor ABT263 and C2-ceramide also
had synergistic effect on cell viability (Fig. 5d). However, individual inhibition of the AKT node failed
to activate mitochondrial apoptosis due to the absence of pro-apoptotic stress, such as the activation
of CERAMIDE node. We found MOMP could only be fully activated when the CERAMIDE node was fixed in the ON state while the AKT node remained OFF, leading to the activation of downstream
CYTC, CASP9 and CASP3, and consequently, cell apoptosis. To further validate this mechanism, we
detected apoptosis using AnnexinV-propidium iodide dual staining. In accordance with our model, combined treatment of MK2206 and C2-ceramide showed strong synergistic apoptotic effects on HT29
cells (Fig. 5e). C2-ceramide or MK2206 alone induced approximately 20% cell apoptosis, whereas their
combination significantly increased the apoptosis level to 40–60% (Fig.  5e). These results agree with those obtained by the combination of siRNA against AKT1, 2 and 3 and C2-ceramide (Fig.  5f and Supplementary Fig. S6b). We consistently observed the cleavage of caspase 3, 8 and 9 and PARP follow-
ing combined treatment with MK2206 and C2-ceramide (Fig. 5g). The occurrence of apoptosis stemmed
from a key mitochondrial event, namely cytochrome C release, which was not induced by individual treatments compared with the control group but was significantly increased after the combination of
MK2206 and C2-ceramide (Fig. 5h).
To further explore the clinical potential of our combination strategy, we tested combinations of mar -
keted chemotherapeutic drugs. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the upstream tyrosine kinases of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Dosing HT-29 cells with C2-ceramide together with lapatinib or
gefitinib, two clinically used EGFR inhibitors, exerted synergistic effects on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S6c and S6d). In addition, PI3K/AKT inhibitors and FTY720 (fingolimod), which has previously
been shown to inhibit and degrade SPHK1
49, and conversely increase ceramide levels50, also had com-
binatory effects, although to a lesser extent than C2-ceramide (Supplementary Fig. S6e and S6f). In agreement with our previous findings that FTY720 stimulates endogenous ceramide accumulation
by modulating sphingolipid metabolism
50, FTY720 treatment elevated ceramide levels in HT-29 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6g).

In this article, we presented a reconstruction of the CAC network and its implementation as a discrete dynamic Boolean model. The rationality of the CAC network model was justified by comparing the
simulation results with existing observations, as well as novel experimental validations. Comprehensive
analysis of the dynamic properties of the CAC network was also performed to unravel the missing link between chronic inflammation and cancer development and to identify potential therapeutic targets.

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739Through manipulation of the nodes in the microenvironment component of the CAC network model,
we suggests that dendritic cells play critical roles in forming the pro-proliferative inflammatory microen-
vironment. The transient activation of DCs initiates a controlled inflammatory reaction and eventually
leads to an immune suppressive microenvironment, whereas the sustained activation of DCs leads to a dysregulated inflammatory microenvironment, which strongly supports the proliferation and survival
of IECs. In addition, we thoroughly characterized the dynamic properties of CAC network under the
pro-tumor inflammatory microenvironment and identified a core regulatory network that governed the cell outcome. According to the core regulatory network, P53 inactivation was found to be critical for
malignant transformation of epithelial cells under the pro-tumor inflammatory microenvironment. The
result was supported by current findings of a dysregulated P53 pathway during CAC development and partly explained that in the ‘two-hit’ model, a somatic mutation is necessary for tumour initiation in a pro-tumour inflammatory microenvironment
39.
Subsequent systematic perturbation analysis indicated that various dysregulations could facilitate
the malignant transformation of preneoplastic IECs in an inflammatory microenvironment, including the hyperactivation of the NF-κ B, PI3K/AKT or the COX2 pathways. Many perturbations were also
predicted to suppress cell survival and proliferation of IECs in an inflammatory microenvironment,
such as the inhibition of the ERK/MAPK pathway or the SPHK1/S1P pathway. These perturbations
can be used as an early intervention method to prevent CAC development. However, the CAC network in a P53 inactive state, which mimicked malignant transformed IECs, was more resistant to perturba-
tions. Double perturbation studies on the P53-inactivated CAC network suggested that combinatorial
intervention methods through multi-targeted drugs or drug combinations could be more effective at treating later-stage CAC patients. Most importantly, we discovered and validated some novel combina-torial therapeutic approaches. We found that simultaneously inhibiting PI3K/AKT signalling and add-
ing C2-ceramide, a pro-apoptotic sphingolipid signalling molecule, had a synergistic cytotoxic effect
on colon cancer cells under an inflammatory stimulus. We explored the underlying mechanism of this synergistic effect by combining biochemical experiments and network simulations. We demonstrated
that this effect was primarily attributed to regulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. As a
pro-apoptotic signalling molecule, ceramide can directly or indirectly target mitochondria and lead to the release of apoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome C, and initiate the apoptosis machinery
51,52.
However, in many tumour cells, the PI3K/AKT pathway is highly active, which could in turn adversely
affect the integrity of the mitochondria outer membrane by indirectly activating anti-apoptotic BCL-2
family proteins, such as BCL-2 or BCL-xL53. Our simulation results and previous experimental findings
also suggest that inflammatory signalling can activate the AKT pathway to enhance survival of tumour
cells. Therefore, only when PI3K/AKT signalling is blocked can the apoptosis machinery effectively be
activated by a pro-apoptotic stimulus, such as ceramide (Fig. 6). Our results may also explain previous findings in which D, L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), a modula-
tor of ceramide metabolism that elevates endogenous ceramide levels, could sensitise leukemic cells to
the treatment of ABT263, an inhibitor of anti-apoptotic BCL2-like proteins
54.
Figure 6. Proposed model for the synergistic effect between ceramide and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors
in inducing apoptotic cell death of cancer cells. Ceramide directly or indirectly targets mitochondria,
leading to the release of apoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome C, and activates caspases. However, if the
PI3K/AKT pathway is activated by an inflammatory stimulus or other growth factors, it can preserve the
integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane by activating the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family of proteins, such as BCL-2 or BCL-xL, by inhibiting PP2A or BAD. Therefore, ceramide and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors exert a synergistic cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. Note: the arrows in this simplified scheme are
not intended to indicate direct physiological interactions.

Scientific  RepoRts  | 5:14739 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14739We are aware that this model is unable to capture the full complexity of CAC development. Some
unknown factors may be present in CAC development, and merely incorporating outcomes, such as
proliferation and apoptosis, is insufficient to assess tumour development. However, the basic property of
tumour cells is uncontrolled proliferation, and inducing growth arrest or apoptosis is the most effective method to prevent cancer development. Therefore, our theoretical model can provide valuable informa-
tion to guide further experimental studies, and this model can be easily refined and expanded with the
availability of additional information.
In conclusion, the dynamic modelling of the CAC development process can lead to a better mechanis-
tic understanding of CAC and other inflammation-associated cancers because CAC serves as a paradigm for inflammation-associated cancer development. Our model and experimental findings will also be helpful in identifying novel therapeutic targets and the design of combinatorial therapeutic approaches to achieve early prevention and treatment of CAC.
Materials and Methods
Construction of the CAC network. A hierarchical method was used to construct the CAC network.
First, signalling components that are critical participants in IBD and colorectal cancer, as indicated by a
literature search, were collected. These components were used as seed nodes to build the initial network
model. Then, the initial network was expanded using the GeneGo database (http://www.genego.com/). The regulatory relationships were then verified manually, and the interactions that were not specifically
mentioned to be relevant to colitis or colon cancer were removed. Further, a similar approach, such as the
one Zhang et al.
13,55 used in constructing T-LGL network model, was adopted to remove the redundant
and indirect interactions between nodes.
Boolean dynamic modelling. In the Boolean model, each node has only two discrete states: ON and
OFF (1 and 0). The regulatory relationships between upstream nodes (regulators) and downstream nodes (targets) are expressed by the logical operators AND, OR and NOT
56. The future state of each node can
be determined by the current states of the nodes and the Boolean transfer function ,→ ,{} f:{01}0 1iki ,
where ki is the number of regulators of node i. In Boolean models, the time variable is discrete and
usually designated as steps. To propagate the discrete states of a Boolean model, different node-updating
strategies have been proposed, such as synchronous and asynchronous update methods21. In this study,
we mainly used a general asynchronous (GA) method57, in which a randomly selected node is updated
at each time step. To evaluate the general behaviour trends for all nodes in the network model, multiple replicate simulations were performed from the same initial conditions but with random update orders.
These trends can be reflected by the activation frequency for each node, which was calculated by dividing the number of simulations where the node is ON by the total replicate number. The GA method has been
widely used in modelling signal transduction networks and has been suggested to be the most informa-
tive and computationally efficient method among asynchronous updating strategies
21,56. We also com-
pared the simulation results using synchronous method, GA method and another asynchronous updating
method—random order asynchronous (ROA) method58.
Network reduction. Considering that the size of the state space of a Boolean model is exponentially
dependent on the node number (a Boolean network with n nodes has 2n states) and attractor identifica-
tion is a strong NP-complete problem, tracking all of the attractors within a relatively small network is computationally demanding. Therefore, we used a network reduction method proposed by Saadatpour
et al.
21 to reduce the node number while maintaining the long-term behaviour of the dynamic model.
First, the nodes that stabilise in an attracting state (ON or OFF) during the entire simulation are elimi-
nated. The attracting states of these nodes are only determined by the states of the input nodes and can
be readily identified by inspecting the Boolean functions. Second, the simple mediator nodes, with both
in-degrees and out-degrees equal to one, are iteratively removed, and their input and output nodes are
connected directly. The dangling nodes (nodes with zero out-degrees) are also removed. This method can effectively reduce the network size and maintain the fixed point, as well as the complex attractor of
Boolean models, using either synchronous or GA methods.
Attractor identification. When updating a Boolean model, the state of the whole system at a certain
time step is defined by the collection of the states of all the nodes at that step. As the Boolean model evolves over time, all the possible states of the system constitute the state space, which can be represented
by a state transition graph whose nodes are the states of the system and the edges are allowed transitions among states. Attractors are special states in the state transition graph that the system will eventually
settle down to and will not transit to other states. An attractor can either be a fixed point, in which the
state of the system does not change, or a complex attractor, in which the states traverse regularly or irregularly over a series of states
56.
To identify the attractors of the reduced CAC network model, we firstly constructed the state transi-
tion graph by updating the model starting from all possible initial states. Subsequently, the strongly con-nected components (SCCs) of the state transition graph were identified. SCCs are subgraphs of a directed graph in which every node is reachable from every other node. Complex attractors of a Boolean modelpaper_11	p

The nerve growth factor NGF has been shown to cause cell fate decisions toward either
differentiation or proliferation depending on the relative activity of downstream pERK,
pAKT, or pJNK signaling. However, how these protein signals are translated into and
fed back from transcriptional activity to complete cellular differentiation over a time span
of hours to days is still an open question. Comparing the time-resolved transcriptome
response of NGF- or EGF-stimulated PC12 cells over 24 h in combination with protein
and phenotype data we inferred a dynamic Boolean model capturing the temporal
sequence of protein signaling, transcriptional response and subsequent autocrine
feedback. Network topology was optimized by ﬁtting the model to time-resolved
transcriptomedataunderMEK,PI3K,orJNKinhibition.Theintegratedmodelconﬁrmed
the parallel use of MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and JNK/JUN for PC12 cell differentiation.
Redundancy of cell signaling is demonstrated from the inhibition of the different MAPK
pathways. As suggested insilicoand conﬁrmed invitro, differentiation was substantially
suppressed under JNK inhibition, yet delayed only under MEK/ERK inhibition. Most
importantly, we found that positive transcriptional feedback induces bistability in the cell
fateswitch. Denovo geneexpressionwasnecessarytoactivateautocrinefeedbackthat
caused Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator (uPA) Receptor signaling to perpetuate
the MAPK activity, ﬁnally resulting in the expression of late, differentiation related genes.
Thus, the cellular decision toward differentiation depends on the establishment of a
transcriptome-inducedpositivefeedbackbetweenproteinsignalingandgeneexpression
thereby constituting a robust control between proliferation and differentiation.

1. INTRODUCTION
The rat pheochromocytoma cells PC12 are a long established in vitromodel to study neuronal
diﬀerentiation,proliferationandsurvival( GreeneandTischler,1976;Bursteinetal.,1982;Cowley

of up to 6 days ( Levi-Montalcini, 1987; Chao, 1992; Fiore et al.,
2009; Weber et al., 2013 ). NGF binds with high aﬃnity to the
TrkA receptor (tyrosine kinase receptor A), thereby activati ng
several downstream protein signaling pathways including
primarily the protein kinase C/phospholipase C (PKC/PLC),
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT)
and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular sig nal-
regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways ( Kaplan et al., 1991;
Jing et al., 1992; Vaudry et al., 2002 ). Beyond these immediate
downstream pathways, further studies showed the involvemen t
of Interleukin 6 (IL6), Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA )
and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 12A
(TNFRSF12A) in PC12 cell diﬀerentiation ( Marshall, 1995; Wu
and Bradshaw, 1996; Leppä et al., 1998; Xing et al., 1998; Faria s-
Eisner etal.,2000,2001;Vaudry etal.,2002;Tanabeet al., 2003).
Sustained ERK activation is seen as necessary and suﬃcient fo r

Marshall, 1995; Vaudry et al., 2002 ). In fact, selective pathway

ERK activation likewise determine the cellular decision betw een
proliferationanddiﬀerentiation( Dikicetal.,1994;Vaudryetal.,
2002; Santos et al., 2007 ). Consequently, the MAPK signaling
network, as the key pathway in the cellular response, has been
studied thoroughly in vitroandin silico(Sasagawa et al., 2005;
von Kriegsheim et al., 2009; Saito et al., 2013 ). Interestingly,
both EGF and NGF provoke a similar transcriptional program
within the ﬁrst hour. Therefore, diﬀerences in cellular signa ling
mustbedue(i)todiﬀerentialregulationofmultipledownstre am
pathways and (ii) late gene response programs ( >1 h) that
feed back into the protein signaling cascade. As an example for
pathway crosstalk, both, the MAPK/ERK and c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) pathways regulate c-Jun activity and are necessar y
for PC12 cell diﬀerentiation ( Leppä et al., 1998; Waetzig and
Herdegen, 2003; Marek et al., 2004 ), while uPA receptor (uPAR)

(Farias-Eisneretal.,2000;Mullenbrocketal.,2011 ).
In the present study, we combined time-resolved
transcriptome analysis of EGF and NGF stimulated PC12
cells up to 24 h with inhibition of MAPK/ERK, JNK/JUN, and
PI3K/AKT signaling, to develop a Boolean Model of PC12 cell
diﬀerentiation that combines protein signaling, gene regula tion
and autocrine feedback. The Boolean approach allows to derive
important predictions without detailed quantitative kineti c
data and parameters over diﬀerent time scales ( Singh et al.,
2012). Protein signaling comprised MAPK/ERK, JNK/JUN,
and PI3K/AKT pathways. Based on the upstream transcription
factor analysis and transcriptional regulation of Mmp10(Matrix
Metallopeptidase 10), Serpine1 (Serpin Peptidase Inhibitor,
Clade E, Member) and Itga1(Integrin, Alpha 1), we further
included an autocrine feedback via uPAR signaling. The mode l
topology was trained on the transcriptional response after
pathway inhibition. Inhibition of JNK completely blockedPC12 cell diﬀerentiation and long-term expression of target
transcription factors (TFs), such as various Kruppel-like fac tors
(Klf2,4,6and10),Maﬀ(V-Maf Avian Musculoaponeurotic
Fibrosarcoma Oncogene Homolog F) and AP1. Interestingly,
inhibition of MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) ,
blocking the phosphorylation of ERK, slowed down, but not
completely abolished cell diﬀerentiation. Neurite quantiﬁcat ion
over 6 days conﬁrmed a late and reduced, but signiﬁcant PC12
diﬀerentiation, which hinted at alternative pathway usage
through JNK. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is
involved in cell proliferation ( Chen et al., 2012 ), even increased
theneuronalmorphologyandneuriteoutgrowth.
In conclusion, our Boolean modeling approach shows the
complex interplay of protein signaling, transcription factor
activity and gene regulatory feedback in the decision and
perpetuationofPC12celldiﬀerentiationafterNGFstimulatio n.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Cell Culture and Stimulation
PC12 cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture
Collection, UK) and were cultured at 37◦C at 5% CO 2in
RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% Horse Serum, 5%
Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PAN Biotech ,
Germany) and 1% glutamine (PAN Biotech, Germany). For
cell stimulation, 500,000 cells/well were seeded on collagen
coated 6 well plates (Corning, NY, USA). The following day,
cells were stimulated with 50ng/ml rat nerve growth factor
(NGF; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) or 75ng/ml epidermal
growth factor (EGF; R&D Systems; Wiesbaden, Germany)
for the corresponding times. For the pathway inhibition
experiments, the following inhibitors were used and added 60
min before NGF was added, mitogen-activated protein inhibit or
at a concentration of 20 µM (MEKi; U0126 from Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor at a
concentration of 40 µM (PI3Ki; LY-294002 from Enzo Life
Sciences,NewYork,USA)andc-JunN-terminalkinaseinhibito r
at a concentration of 20 µM (JNKi; SP600125 from Sigma-
Aldrich,St.Louis,USA).TheinhibitorsweredissolvedinDMS O
andwerefurtherdilutedincellculturemediumattheirworki ng
concentration. Control cells were treated with DMSO at the
same concentration that was present in the cells with inhibito r
treatment.
2.2. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real
Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from 500,000 cells per timepoint
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Universal RNA
Puriﬁcation Kit, Roboklon, Germany). RNA integrity
was measured using an Agilent Bioanalyzer-2000 (Agilent
Technologies GmbH, Waldbronn, Germany), and its content
quantiﬁed by NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Wilmington, USA). For RT-qPCR, double strand cDNA was
synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA using the iScriptTMcDNA
Synthesiskit(QuantaBiosciences,Gaithersburg,USA)acco rding
to the manufacturer instructions. RT-qPCR was performed in
a CFX96 instrument (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) using a

SYBR Green master mix. Relative gene expression levels were
calculated with the 2- /Delta1/Delta1Ct method, using HPRT1 and 18S
ribosomal RNA as reference genes. Post-run analyses were
performed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager version 2.0 and the
thresholdcycles(Cts)werecalculatedfromabaselinesubt racted
curveﬁt.SeeSupplementaryTable1forprimerpairsequences.
2.3. Microscopy and Quantiﬁcation
Live phase contrast images from PC12 cells under the diﬀerent
conditions were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti Inverted
Microscope (Nikon; Düsseldorf, Germany) equipped with a
Perfect Focus System (PFS) and a Digital cooled Sight Camera
(DS-QiMc;Nikon,Germany)asdescribedin( Weberetal.,2013 ).
Brieﬂy, PC12 cells were cultured in collagen coated 6-well pla tes
(500,000 cells/well) and treated as described in “Cell cult ure and
stimulation” and 150 images per well, every second day were
recorded with the same spatial pattern. Cell diﬀerentiation is
calculated by the ratio of the two described imaging feature s
(Weber et al., 2013 ) convex hull (CH) to cell area (CA) for 150
imagesperwellover6days(Weberetal.,unpublisheddata).
2.4. Western Blot
For each timepoint and condition 3 ×106PC12 cells (for
inhibition experiments) or 5 ×106PC12 cells (for EGF vs.
NGF comparison) were seeded in 10cm collagen coated Cell
BIND dishes (Corning; Germany). Cells were collected after 5,
10, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h in 200 µl RIPA
buﬀer (containing 0.5% SDS), supplemented with proteinase
inhibitor (complete mini EDTA free tablets, Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) and Benzonase (Merck), and lysed for 20 min
under agitation. A total of 30 µg protein was loaded per
lane and run in 10% SDS- polyacrylamide gels, transferred
to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. Membranes were cut
horizontally into fragments according to the expected sizes
of the protein of interest and immunoblotted with antibodies
against total p44/42 (ERK1/2, 1:2000, #9102S, Cell Signaling
Technology [CST]), phospho p44/42 (pERK1/2, 1:2000, #9101S,
CST), total JNK (JNK1/2, 1:1000, #9258S, CST), phospho JNK
(Thr183/Tyr185, 1:1000, #4668S, CST), total AKT (1:1000,
#4691S, CST), phospho AKT (1:1000, Ser473, #9271S, CST)
or GAPDH (1:2000,# MAB374, Millipore) overnight at 4◦C.
ProteinswerevisualizedwithchemiluminescenceonSuperSi gnal
WestPicoChemiluminiscentSubstrateimager(Thermo-Fisc her,
Massachusetts, USA) after 1h of incubation with appropriate
horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Sigma-
Aldrich). Immunoblots were quantiﬁed using ImageJ (image
analyzer camera LAS4000, Fujiﬁlm, Tokyo, Japan). Blots were
normalized to total GAPDH and an internal standard (IS) was
usedfornormalizationbetweenmembranes.
2.5. Microarray Analysis and Data
Pre-processing
Time-resolved gene expression data of stimulated PC12
were recorded at t=[1,2,3,4,5,6,8,12,24] h and
t=[1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24] h for NGF and EGF stimulation,
respectively. Control timepoints were measured at
0,2,4,6,8,12,24 h. Total RNA was isolated, labeled andhybridized to an Illumina RatRef-12 BeadChip (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol.
Raw microarray data were processed and quantile normalized
using the Bioconductor R package beadarray ( Ritchie et al.,
2011). Illumina Probes were mapped to reannotated Entrez
IDs using the Illumina Ratv1 annotation data (v. 1.26) from
Bioconductor. If several probes mapped to the same Entrez ID,
the one having the largest interquartile range was retained . This
resultedin15,348annotatedgenes,whoseexpressionwasfurt her
batch corrected according to their chip identity ( Johnson et al.,
2007). Finally, gene expression time series were smoothed by
a 5thorder polynomial to take advantage of the high sampling
rate and replicates at 0, 12, and 24 h. Microarray data have
been deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the
accessionnumberGSE74327.
2.6. Multi-Dimensional Scaling
To determine signiﬁcantly regulated genes over time we
performed a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) using the HiT-
MDS algorithm ( Strickert et al., 2005 ). The algorithm projects
the 15348 ×15348 distance matrix Dof the pairwise Euclidean
distances between all genes onto a two dimensional space, whi le
preserving distances in Das best as possible. Genes varying
strongly and uniquely over time will appear as outliers in the
MDS point distribution. The uniqueness of a gene expression
proﬁle was quantiﬁed by ﬁtting a two-dimensional skewed
Gaussian distribution ( Azzalini, 2015 ) to the MDS point density
function.
2.7. Clustering Gene Expression Patterns
To cluster the gene timeseries, we applied the Cluster Aﬃnity
Search Technique (CAST), which considers the genes and their
similarity over times as nodes and weighted edges of graph,
respectively ( Ben-Dor et al., 1999 ). All clusters are considered
as unrelated entities and there is no pre-deﬁned number of
clusters.Insteadathresholdparameter,here t=0.8,determines
the aﬃnity between genes and this the ﬁnal number of gene
clusters. Inverse or anti-correlative behavior of genes af ter NGF
or EGF stimulation was determined by ﬁtting a linear model
to the smoothed gene expression. Genes having a signiﬁcant
slope with opposite sign and an r2>0.7 were taken as
anti-correlated.
2.8. Enrichment Analysis of Transcription
Factor Target Gene Sets
Upstream analysis for putative transcription factors regulatin g
the EGF and NGF transcriptome responses over time were
assessed by a Gene Set Enrichment analysis ( Luo et al., 2009 )
using paired control to treatment samples for each timepoint
with an overall cutoﬀ q-value < 0.01. As gene sets we used the
transcription factor target lists from the Molecular Signatu res
Database (MSigDB, version 5.0) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 ), for

2.9. Boolean Model
We used a Boolean model framework for dynamic analysis of
PC12 cell diﬀerentiation. Based on our microarray data and
literature knowledge we constructed a highly connected prio r
knowledge network (PKN) consisting of 63 nodes and 109
edges (cf. Supplementary Table 2). The R/Bioconductor package
CellNetOptimizer (CNO) ( Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2009 ) was used
tooptimizethePKNbyreducingredundantnodes,unobservabl e
states and edges. For this we rescaled the qRT-PCR fold chang e

the CellNORdt, which allows ﬁtting with time course data. (Se e
Supplementary Table 3 for stimulus, inhibition and time cours e

genetic algorithm (GA) to 100s and the relative tolerance to
0.01, using default parameters from the CNO otherwise. A

3.1. Gene Response of PC12 Cells Diverges
for NGF and EGF on Long Time Scales
To elucidate the dynamic gene response of NGF and EGF, we
measured the transcriptome dynamics using Illumina RatRef-
12 Expression BeadChips. PC12 cells were either stimulated
with NGF or EGF, and collected at the following timepoints:
1,2,3,4,5,6,8,12,and24h.Theunstimulatedcontrolsamples

A bi plot of the principal component analysis (PCA) for
the 1000 most varying genes depicted a clear separation of the
control, NGF and EGF samples. The PCA scores, representing
theNGFandEGFtreatedsamples,showedaqualitativelysimilar

individual genes to the position of the scores. Corresponding ly,
several immediate early genes, such as Junb(Jun B Proto-
Oncogene), Fos(FBJ Murine Osteosarcoma Viral Oncogene
Homolog), Ier2(Immediate Early Response 2), and Egr1(Early
Growth Response 1) contributed to the early gene response
under both EGF and NGF stimulation, while members of the
uPAR/Integrin signaling complex, such as Mmp13/10/3 (Matrix
Metallopeptidase 13/10/3), Plat(Plasminogen Activator, Tissue)
andSerpine1 (Serpin Peptidase Inhibitor, Clade E, Member 1)
determined, among others, the separation of the NGF from
the EGF trajectory. Loadings that point toward the control an d
late EGF response samples, like Cdca7(Cell Division Cycle
Associated 7) and G0s2(G0/G1 Switch 2), are clearly related to
cell cycle progression and additionally highlight the diﬀere nce
in proliferation vs. diﬀerentiation. In conclusion, the NGF ge ne
response,andthusPC12celldiﬀerentiation,mustbedetermine d
by late transcriptional feedback events, that trigger and sus tain
MAPK/ERKsignaling.
Next, we sought to functionally analyze the transcriptional
diﬀerences in early and late gene regulation after EGF and
NGF stimulation. For this we selected genes that are (i)
strongly regulated ( log2fold change of <−1.7 or >1.7 in
two consecutive timepoints) and (ii) have a unique temporal
expression proﬁle according to a multi-dimensional scaling
(MDS) analysis ( p-value <0.01) (cf. Supplementary Image 2).
We found 152 and 402 genes, meeting both criteria, in the
EGF and NGF data, respectively, among which 126 genes are
sharedbybothconditions. Figure1B depictsaclusteringofthese
diﬀerentially i.e., top-regulated genes. A cluster aﬃnity sea rch
technique( Ben-Doretal.,1999 )identiﬁedﬁveEGF(E1-E3b)and
seven NGF (N1-N4B) gene response clusters (cf. Supplementary
Table 5 and Supplementary Image 3). Interestingly, the EGF
stimulus induced a short pulse-like response with rapid return
to original gene expression levels, while the NGF stimulus
inducedacombinationofshort-impulselike(N1-N2b)andlon g
sustained gene expression patterns with several clusters (N3a -

or diﬀerentiation speciﬁc processes fall into the category of
inversely regulated genes and are not amongst the set of top-
regulated genes identiﬁed earlier (cf. Figure1C , green and gray

The genes involved in the procession of extracellular matrix

In summary, functional analysis of the gene clusters reveal ed

such as transmission of nerve impulse or DNA replication,however, seemed to be executed by two distinct gene groups

sets we used the motif gene sets from the Molecular Signatures
Database(MSigDBv5.0)( Subramanianetal.,2005 )andmapped
the human genes onto the rat orthologs using BiomaRt ( Huang
etal.,2014 ).
Figure2A compares the temporal signiﬁcance of
transcription factors for EGF and NGF stimulation. EGF
elicited an early, yet transient signiﬁcance of all transcr iption
factors,whilethetime-resolvedtranscriptionfactorsign iﬁcances
for NGF showed early, transient and late activity. Figure2B
depicts the diﬀerences in TF signiﬁcance between NGF and
EGF. The most down-regulated TFs relative to EGF are E2F1,
EBF1,SOX9andSP1,allofwhicharelinkedtocellproliferatio n
(Bastide et al., 2007; Hallstrom et al., 2008; Györy et al., 20 12;
Zhangetal.,2014 ).
Mullenbrocketal. (2011)showedlateNGF-inducedgenesup
to 4 h were preferentially regulated by AP1 and CREB (cAMP
response element-binding protein). While AP1 was among the
most persistently up-regulated transcription factors, we fou nd
a transient signiﬁcance for CREB1, only, peaking at 3 and 6 h,
underEGForNGFstimulation,respectively,whichindicatedt he
importance of further TFs beyond that time window. In fact,
we found the highest positive diﬀerences in the transcription
factors BACH2, AP1, as well as ELF2 and ETV4. The latter
two belong to the ETS transcription factor family. In particul ar
ETV4, a member of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS, has been
shown to promote neurite outgrowth ( Fontanet et al., 2013;
Kandemiretal.,2014 ).BACH2,memberoftheBTB-basicregion
leucine zipper transcription factor family, is known to down-
regulate proliferation and is involved in neuronal diﬀerenti ation
of neoblastoma cells via p21 expression ( Shim et al., 2006 )
and it interacts with the transcription factor MAFF (V-Maf
Avian Musculoaponeurotic Fibrosarcoma Oncogene Homolog
F)(Kannanetal.,2012 )thatisnecessaryfordiﬀerentiation.
To analyze the early cellular response upon treatment, we
additionally compared the phosphorylation levels of pERK,
pAKT and pJNK under NGF and EGF stimulation over time
(Figure2C ). As expected, pERK increased after NGF and EGF
stimulation, showing a persistent up-regulation for 8 h or
pulse-like response, respectively. pJNK was continuously up-
regulatedunderNGFrelativetoEGFstimulation,whereaspAK T
responded similar to both stimuli, yet showed a consistently
higher phosphorylation under EGF beyond 2 h. Taken together,
this corroborates the roles of both pERK and pJNK as well as
pAKT inPC12 cell diﬀerentiationandproliferation, respectively
(WaetzigandHerdegen,2003;Chenetal.,2012 ).
Basedonthecombinedtranscriptome,upstreamtranscription
factor and protein analyses we next developed a comprehensive
prior knowledge interaction network (PKN) for NGF induced
PC12 cell diﬀerentiation. The PKN comprises key players of
known pathways involved in PC12 cell diﬀerentiation, such
as ERK/PLC/PI3K/JNK/P38/uPAR/NPY and integrin signaling,
as well as “linker nodes” to obtain a minimal, yet fully
connected network, consisting of 63 nodes and 109 reactions
(cf. Supplementary Table 4 for reference publications). ThenetworkisdepictedinSupplementaryImage4withdiﬀerentially
regulated genes obtained from our timeseries marked in red
and points of inhibition indicated by orange. A Cytoscape
readable network format is provided in Supplementary Table 2.
Albeit the included PKN pathways are much more complex,
our focus was on simulating a biologically plausible signaling
ﬂow, including protein signaling, gene response and autocrin e
signaling as follows: stimulated TrkA receptor activates the
downstream pathways PLC/PKC, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and
JNK/P38. Phosphorylated ERK, PI3K and P38/JNK together
activate diﬀerent transcription factors such as Fosl1,Fos,Junb,
Btg2,Klf2/5/6/10 ,Cited2,Maﬀ,andEgr1,whichareimportantfor
PC12 cell diﬀerentiation according to our analysis and liter ature

etal.,2004;Erikssonetal.,2007 ).
JunbandFosinitiate the AP1 system, which in turn
inducesuPA/uPARsignaling,triggeringtheformationofpla smin
(Avraham and Yarden, 2011 ). The latter is a major factor for
the induction of Mmp3/Mmp10 , linking degradation of the
extracellularmatrix(ECM)withintegrinsignaling.Theinte grins
transmitextracellularsignalingbackviathefocaladhesio nkinase
(FAK) (Singh et al., 2012 ). FAK activates again the SHC protein,
which closes the autocrine signaling. Previous studies repo rted
that uPAR expression is necessary for NGF-induced PC12 cell
diﬀerentiation ( Farias-Eisner et al., 2000; Mullenbrock et al.,
2011). A second autocrine signaling loop in the initial PKN
putatively acts via the AP1 system, which in turn activates the
Neuropeptide Y (NPY/NPYY1 pathway). NPY is a sympathetic
co-transmitterthatactsviaGprotein-coupledreceptorsthro ugh
interactions with its NPYY1 receptors ( Selbie and Hill, 1998;
Pons et al., 2008 ). NPYY1 receptor further activates Ca2+
dependent PKC /PLCgamma and subsequently convergences to
ERKsignaling.
To optimize the highly connected PKN we used
CellNetOptimizer (CNO) ( Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2009 ). The
CNO ﬁrst compresses the network, i.e., it deletes unobservab le
nodes and then optimizes the network topology using a genetic
algorithm. We trained the PKN using gene expression of
selected diﬀerentially regulated genes under NGF stimulus a nd
inhibition of either MEK, JNK, or PI3K ( Figure3A , MEKi,
JNKi and PI3Ki). The overall gene response showed a gradual
decline in fold change from NGF via MEK to JNK inhibition,
while inhibition of PI3K only moderately impacted the gene
expression( Figure3A ).ThemostaﬀectedgenesunderMEKand
JNK inhibition were members of the uPAR signaling pathway,

in growth arrest ( Tirone, 2001; Yoon et al., 2003 ), which is
a necessary prerequisite for diﬀerentiation and degradation of

andBtg2are regulated remains unclear, we assumed an auto-
inhibition once they mediated their growth arrest eﬀect. Zfp36
belongs to the TTP (Tristetraprolin) family of proteins and ha s
been shown to degrade AU-rich mRNAs, particularly of early
response genes ( Amit et al., 2007 ). It negatively regulates its
own expression ( Tiedje et al., 2012 ) and therefore in the model

note, another member of the TTP protein family, Zfp36l2 (zinc

long times after NGF stimulation (data not shown) and might

data revealed a reduction on gene expression of Egr1,Fosand
Junbovertime( Figure3A ).
We simulated the optimized and re-expanded Boolean
network (cf. Supplementary Table 8) using the BoolNet
R/Bioconductor package ( Müssel et al., 2010 ), performing
two types of simulations. First, we tested the robustness and
alternative attractors by setting NGF to “on” and randomly
initializing all other network nodes. The nodes were then
synchronously updated until a steady state was reached. With in
n=107diﬀerent simulations, the same ﬁnal network state with
“cell diﬀerentiation” set to “on” was always reached. Althou gh
this was not an exhaustive search given the number of possible
initial network states, it still demonstrated the robustne ss of
the network output. Next, to show the information ﬂow from
the NGF receptor to the downstream nodes under diﬀerent
inhibitory conditions, we initialized all nodes except NGF t o
“oﬀ” and performed synchronous updates until a steady state
was reached ( Figure4A ). Without inhibition, NGF sequentially
switches on MAPK, AKT and JNK pathways as well as uPAR
signaling. Klf4,Btg2, andZfp36become transiently active, with
the latter delaying AP1 activity. Blocking MEK (NGF +MEKi)
inhibited ERK and thus several downstream targets, includin g
the uPAR feedback. As the latter is assumed indispensable for
PC12 cell diﬀerentiation, ( Farias-Eisner et al., 2000, 2001 ), the
model predicted inhibition of PC12 cell diﬀerentiation. The
same phenotype is found, when blocking JNK (NGF+JNKi). In
comparison to NGF +MEKi it even abrogated the activity of
downstreamtargetsaltogether.InhibitionofPI3K(NGF +PI3Ki)
solely aﬀected PI3K and its downstream target protein AKT and
targetgenes MaﬀandKlf10,yetcelldiﬀerentiationpersisted.
Taken together, we developed a core network from the
downstream interactome of PC12 cell pathways involved in
diﬀerentiation. The model captured the dynamic pathway
activation after NGF stimulation and various inhibitions. It
assigned central and synergistic roles for ERK and JNK in PC12
diﬀerentiationwithJNKhavingthelargestimpactonthenetwor k
activity.
3.3. Model Analysis and Experimental
Conﬁrmation
Network simulations were conﬁrmed by live phase-contrast
imaging ( Figure4B ) and western blot analyses ( Figure5). We
measured the convex hull (CH) to cell area (CA) ratio of PC12cells on days 2, 4, and 6. A large convex hull due to extended
neurite (marked as red arrow heads in Figure4B ) and small
overall cell area is indicative of diﬀerentiation ( Figure4B , right
panel).Clearly,thecontinuousCH/CAratioatday2waslargest
for NGF stimulation and NGF stimulation with additional PI3 K
inhibition, which corresponded well with the cell diﬀerentiati on
set to “on” in the network simulations under these condition .
One can speculate whether inhibition of the pro-proliferative
PI3K pathway ampliﬁes cell diﬀerentiation, possibly relieving
a negative feedback. Indeed, a Western blot of the pERK/ERK
ratio depicted a trend to higher ERK phosphorylation relative
toNGFstimulationunderPI3Kinhibition( Figure5)andphase-
contrast images of PC12 cells show more and longer neurites in
comparison to cells treated only with NGF or in combination
to MEKi and JNKi ( Figure4B , NGF+PI3Ki). Interestingly,
image analysis suggested not a stop, but rather a delay of cell
diﬀerentiation under MEK inhibition. In detail, PC12 cells sho w
noneuritesunderMEKiafter2daysofcombinedNGFtreatment
compared to NGF alone or NGF-PI3Ki. After 4 and 6 days of
NGF+MEKi treatment, less cells have neurites in comparison to
cells that were only treated with NGF ( Figure4B , NGF+MEKi).
In line with literature, pERK levels were reduced, yet pJNK
levelswerelikewiseincreased,indicatingaredirectiono fprotein
activity under MEK inhibition ( Figure5, right panel). Likewise,
the gene expression showed a reduced, but not completely
abolished fold change for Mmp10(Figure3A ) and also an up-
regulationofDusp6.AlthoughthediscreteBooleanmodelcou ld
not simulate gradual responses, MEK inhibition still resulted
in the activation of several downstream target genes necessa ry
for PC12 cell diﬀerentiation, while none of these were active
under JNK inhibition. In summary, modeling and simulation
suggested that PC12 diﬀerentiation involved the activity of
bothJNK/JUN,MAPK/ERKandPI3K/AKTsignalingpathways.
The establishment of a positive, autocrine feedback loop was
indispensabletoactivelateandpersistentgeneexpression.
4. DISCUSSION
PC12 cells are a well established model to study the cellular
decisions toward proliferation or diﬀerentiation. Neverthel ess,
there is still a lack of understanding on how protein signalin g
and gene regulation interact on diﬀerent time scales to decid e
on a long-term, sustained phenotype. Given the fact that PC12
cell cycle and diﬀerentiation last up to 4 and 6 days, respectiv ely
(GreeneandTischler,1976;Luoetal.,1999;Adamskietal.,2 007),
late events occurring beyond the ﬁrst hours are most likely to
be important for sustaining the cellular decision. However, fe w

regulated by both EGF and NGF stimulation (Supplementary

It has been suggested before that distinct cellular stimuli
activate similar sets of response genes, whose expressiondynamics, rather than their composition, determine cellular
decisions ( Murphy and Blenis, 2006; Amit et al., 2007; Yosef

FIGURE 5 | Quantiﬁcation of pERK, pAKT and pJNK levels under N GF and individual inhibitor treatments. Determination of pERK/ERK, pAKT/AKT and
pJNK/JNK under NGF, NGF +MEKi, NGF +JNKi and NGF +PI3Ki treatment. Left panel: pERK/ERK levels decrease over ti me under NGF plus MEK and JNK inhibition.
In contrast, PI3K inhibition shows a similar increase and sust ained pERK/ERK levels over time compared to NGF treated PC12 c ells alone. Interestingly, pAKT/AKT is
increased under NGF+MEKi treatment, which is particularly signiﬁcant in the early timepoints (30min and 1h) compared to NGF alone or the other two inhibitors. The
latter two show decreased pAKT/AKT levels over time (middle p anel). A*denotes a p-value <0.05, data points obtained in duplicates and triplicates.

and AP1 ( Hoﬀmann et al., 2005 ) andAtf3has been shown to
modulate Egr1activity (Giraldo et al., 2012 ), whileMaﬀand
Klf2negatively regulate serum response and STAT-responsive
promoter elements ( Amit et al., 2007 ). The same genes respond
after NGF stimulation, however with a delayed response and
might be one of the reasons for the stronger and longer gene
andpERKresponseunderNGFstimulation( Murphyetal.,2002,
2004;MurphyandBlenis,2006;Saitoetal.,2013 ).
A recent study by Mullenbrock et al. (2011) compared
the transcriptome response of PC12 cells to EGF and NGF
stimulation up to 4 h. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
they found a preferential regulation of late genes through AP 1
and CREB TFs after NGF stimulation, which is in line with
our ﬁndings ( Figure2A ). However, we predicted a constitutive
signiﬁcance for AP1 up to 24 h, while CREB1 displayed
a transient importance, being most abundant at 6 h after
stimulation. Furthermore, we found aswitchinthecompositi on
of transcriptional master regulators between 4 and 12 h. Duri ng
this time, late TFs, such as BACH2, ETS1 and ELF2 become
active.
Supplementary Image 5 depicts a Volcano plot of their
target genes. Beyond the early gene targets, such as Fosl1or
Junb, the late TFs additionally target related to cytoskeleton,
morphogenesis and apoptosis, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor
Receptor Superfamily, Member 12A ( Tnfrsf12a ), Doublecortin-
Like Kinase 1 ( Dclk1), Nerve Growth Factor Inducible Vgf,
Coronin, Actin Binding Protein, 1A ( Coro1a, Growth Arrest
And DNA-Damage-Inducible, Alpha ( Gadd45a) andNpy. Of
note, we found Rasa2among the targets, which has recently
been identiﬁed as a driver for diﬀerentiation through a negat ive
feedbackbetweenPI3KandRAS( Chenetal.,2012 ).
A recent study by Aoki et al. (2013) investigated the down-
stream gene response upon light-induced intermittent and
continuous ERK activation in normal rat kidney epithelial cel ls.
SimilartotheTFactivityafterEGFandNGFstimulationinPC 12
cells, intermittent pERK activity caused up-regulation of Fos,
Egfr,Ier2, andFgf21, which were putatively controlled through
serum response factor (SRF) and CREB binding sites, whilesustained pERK activity caused gene regulation controlled by

or NGF, that eventually encode the transcriptional program

To elucidate the various pathways and downstream target
genes under NGF stimulation we constructed a Boolean model
based on our transcriptome and additional literature data.
A prior knowledge network revealed a highly interconnected
pathway map transmitting NGF-induced signals. Training the
networkviainhibitionofMEK,JNKorPI3Kreducedthenumber
of edges and nodes by about 80% and revealed the MAPK/JNK
pathwayassecondsignalinghubnexttoMAPK/ERK.Moreover,
blocking the JNK pathway had a more drastic eﬀect on cell
diﬀerentiation than blocking MAPK/ERK via inhibition of
MEK through UO126. Indeed, studies on the eﬀect of MEK
inhibition for PC12 cell diﬀerentiation are inconclusive. E arly
studies report how MEK inhibition completely averted PC12
cell diﬀerentiation ( Pang et al., 1995; Klesse et al., 1999 ),
while recent experiments suggest a decrease, rather than ful l
inhibition of diﬀerentiation ( Levkovitz et al., 2001; Chung et al.,
2014). Our results were in line with the latter. Despite a
signiﬁcant reduction in pERK ( Figure5), our cell morphology
measurements detected merely a decrease in the formation of
neurites,ratherthanfullinhibitionofdiﬀerentiation.Th ereason
for this discrepancy could lie in the time scale of observatio n.
MEK inhibition delayed diﬀerentiation and it took 6 days to
eventually overcome this delay ( Figure4B ). This conﬁrmed the
modeling results, which established JNK as key regulator that
is closely interlinked with MAPK/ERK signaling. In concert
with pERK, also pJNK becomes constitutively active upon NGF
stimulation ( Figure2C ). Moreover, blocking pERK through
MEK even increased pJNK (and pAKT) levels, while pERK
decreasedafterJNKinhibition,verifyingacrosstalkbetwe enJNK
and ERK pathways. Previous reports suggested such a crosstalk
due to dual-phosphatase interaction ( Fey et al., 2012 ), while
other studies proposed that JNK phosphorylates RAF ( Adler
et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2012 ) and thereby contributing to
MAPK/ERKactivity.However,themechanisticdetailsgoverni ng

Abstract
Background: Qualitative dynamics of small gene regulato ry networks have been studied in quite
some details both with synchronous and asynchrono us analysis. However, both methods have their
drawbacks: synchronous analysis leads to spurio us attractors and asynch ronous analysis lacks
computational efficiency, which is a problem to  simulate large networks. We addressed this
question through the analysis of  a major biosynthesis pathway. Indeed the cholesterol synthesis
pathway plays a pivotal role in dislypidemia and,  ultimately, in cancer through intermediates such
as mevalonate, farnesyl pyroph osphate and geranyl geranyl pyro phosphate, but no dynamic model
of this pathway has been proposed until now.
Results: We set up a computational framework to dyna mically analyze large biological networks.
This framework associates a classical and comput ationally efficient sync hronous Boolean analysis
with a newly introduced method based on Markov chains, which identifies  spurious cycles among
the results of the synchronous simulation. Based on this method, we present here the results of
the analysis of the cholesterol bi osynthesis pathway and its physiol ogical regulation by the Sterol
Response Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs), as we ll as the modeling of the action of statins,
inhibitor drugs, on this pathway. The in silico experiments show the blockade of the cholesterol
endogenous synthesis by statins and its regulation  by SREPBs, in full agreement with the known
biochemical features  of the pathway.
Conclusion: We believe that the method described here  to identify spurious cycles opens new
routes to compute large and biologically relevant  models, thanks to the computational efficiency of
synchronous simulation.
Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we  present here the first dynamic systems biology
model of the human cholesterol pa thway and several of its key regu latory control elements, hoping
it would provide a good basis to perform in silico experiments and confront the resulting properties
with published and experimental data. The model of  the cholesterol pathway and its regulation,
along with Boolean formulae used for simula tion are available on our web site http://

Background
Systems biology
Systems biology is an emerging scientific field that inte-
grates large sets of biological data derived from experi-mental and computational approaches. In this newparadigm, we no longer study entities of biological sys-tems separately, but as a whole. Hence, large data sets can
be translated into sets of links representative of the inter-
actions of species from within single or multiple path-ways. In fact, elementary functions in those systems arethe result of the inherent characteristics of the specific ele-ments involved and the interactions they are engaged inwithin the systems [1]. In biological or biomedical mat-
ters, modeling activities are strongly linked to the nature
and amount of available data on the model. Furthermore,computational studies in systems biology rely on differentformalisms that are intimately connected to the level ofknowledge one has of a biological system. In the presentstudy, the cholesterol synthesis pathway, including mostof its associated reactions, is analyzed to address the effect
of either activators or inhibitors. Hence, blockade can be
attained by targeting the HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, with statins,widely used hypocholesterolemic drugs. Alternatively,activation of the pathway can be triggered by SterolResponse Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs), as part of a
compensatory feedback mechanism. Moreover, to better
analyze this pathway including both enzymatic reactionsand gene regulatory networks, we will focus on theBoolean networks formalism, particularly suitable todelineate dynamic properties from qualitative informa-tion on regulatory interactions [2,3].
Boolean formalism for qualitative modeling and
simulation
A model or simulation of a biological network is said to
be qualitative when each entity of this model is repre-sented by a variable having a finite set of possible values.
We can note here that the possible values that can be
taken by the variable are not necessarily linearly correlatedto the concentration of the represented species. Those val-ues represent qualitative states of the entities from the net-work. In the formalism of Boolean networks, the state ofa species is described by a Boolean variable, which valueis either 1 if the species is active (i.e. its activity is detecta-
ble, in biological terms) or 0 if inactive (its activity is
undetectable). Moreover, a Boolean function allows tocompute the state of a species at time t + 1, knowing the
states of k other species at time t. If we denote by x
i the
state of species i and by bi(x(t)) the associated Boolean
function, we get the following equations for the dynamics
of the Boolean network:
xi(t + 1) = bi(x(t)), 1 ≤ i ≤ n (1)We can note here that the Boolean formalism allows us to
model various biological systems such as gene regulatory
networks and metabolic networks whose entities havevery different timescales.
Construction of a Boolean ne twork: modeling inhibition
and activation
Let us detail how inhibitions and activations should be
modeled in the Boolean network formalism.
 Inhibition: if A is an enzyme that produces a compound
B but can be inhibited by compound C, then the Booleanfunction that predicts the presence of B at time t + 1 will
be: B( t + 1) = A( t) AND NOT(C( t))
 Activation: if A is a precursor of B and the reaction of
transformation of A to B is catalyzed by enzyme C, thenthe Boolean function that predicts the presence of B attime t + 1 will be: B( t + 1) = A( t) AND C( t)
Here is a simple example with 4 genes (A, B, C, D) and the
4 following Boolean functions:
 A(t + 1) = NOT (D( t))
 B(t + 1) = NOT (A( t))
 C(t + 1) = A( t) OR B( t)
 D(t + 1) = NOT (C( t))
The graphical representation of this network can be seen
in figure 1.

Synchronous and asynchronous paradigms in the Boolean
formalism
In Boolean simulations, there are two main paradigms
where conception of time and transition between statesdiffers.
 The simplest one is the synchronous simulation. At each
step of clock (time is moving discretely in Boolean simu-
lations) all the decrease or increase calls are realizedsimultaneously. This approach is computationally effi-cient, but might lead to simulation artifacts such as spuri-ous cycles [4,5], which are cycles that do not appear inasynchronous simulation.
 In asynchronous simulation, only one transition occurs
at each clock step. Thus, the same reaction can occur sev-eral times before another one is completed, which enablesthe simulation of biological systems that contain slowand fast kinetics (equivalent to a stiff system in the Ordi-nary Differential Equations paradigm).
It is worthwhile to note that the steady states, which cor-
respond to some phenotypes, are the same in those twoparadigms. However, some dynamic behaviors can bevery different.
To sum up, synchronous simulations have fewer mode-
ling power but are more computationally efficient whileasynchronous simulations are able to predict a widerrange of biological behaviors but their exhaustive compu-tation becomes intractable for large biological systems[6,7].
In the synchronous paradigm simulation, our simple reg-
ulatory network gives the results partially shown in table1. The study of this truth table shows that {1010} is asteady state (or point attractor, or equilibrium) and that{0010, 1100, 1011} is a state cycle (or dynamic attractor,
or cyclic attractor). This becomes more evident when con-
verting this network into a finite state machine as shownin figure 2. The state colored in green corresponds to thesteady state and the states colored in red correspond to thestate cycle.
In the asynchronous paradigm simulation, our simple
regulatory network gives the finite state machine shown infigure 3. The state colored in green corresponds to the
Table 1: Fragment of the truth ta ble obtained from our simple
regulatory network.

For each initial array of valu es (initial state) at time t, the new array of
values, obtained by evaluating the system through the Boolean functions, is shown on the second line ( t + 1).Finite state machine of our re gulatory network taken as an example in synchronous simulationFigure 2

[1010] colored in green corresponds  to a steady state. It has
5 states and itself in its basin of attraction (i.e. the states

correspond to a state cycle. They have 7 states and them-

steady state in both synchronous and asynchronous sim-
ulations. We recall that steady states are obviously always
the same in synchronous and asynchronous simulations.The states colored in red are the states which correspondto the state cycle in synchronous simulation. The purplearrows propose one way -among many possible- to reachcyclically those states. Note that, for some regulatory net-
works, it is not possible in asynchronous simulation toreach cyclically states which form a state cycle in synchro-
nous simulation. This becomes obvious when looking at
the synchronous and asynchronous simulation results ofa simple negative feedback loop of size 3. The synchro-nous state cycle {010, 101} does not exist in asynchro-nous simulation. These results are shown on our web sitehttp://bioinformaticsu613.free.fr/simpleloopsn3.html
.
Furthermore, we can have an intuition that this purple tra-
jectory is in some way unstable because while cyclingthrough the 3 states {0010, 1100, 1011}, the systemcould have gone through many transitions that lead to thesteady state 1010.
The cholesterol bios ynthesis pathway
Cholesterol is an important constituent of mammalian
cell membranes. It maintains their fluidity and allowsother molecules playing important biological roles, likeglycoproteins, to anchor to the membrane compartment.It is also the precursor of fat-soluble vitamins, includingvitamins A, D, E and K and of various steroids hormones,
such as cortisol, aldosterone, progesterone, the various
estrogens and testosterone. It comes for about one thirdfrom the dietary intake and for about two thirds fromendogenous synthesis from unburned food metabolites.Its synthesis starts from acetyl CoA, through what is oftencalled the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. It occurs in
many cells and tissues, but with higher rates in the intes-
tines, adrenal glands, reproductive organs and liver. Cho-lesterol synthesis is orchestrated by a protein complexformed by the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein(SREBP), the SREBP-cleavage activating protein (SCAP)and the insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig) [8-10]. This com-
plex is maintained in a repressed state located in the endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER). When the cholesterol level is low,Insig1 interaction with SREBP-SCAP complex is relievedallowing SREBP-SCAP to migrate to the Golgi apparatuswhere SREBP is cleaved by two proteases called S1P andS2P. Once SREBP is matured, it migrates to the nucleus
and acts as a transcription factor upon binding to sterol
regulatory elements (SRE) to activate the genes coding forthe main enzymes of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway(e.g. HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, FPP syn-thase, CYP51). The synthesis of cholesterol can be regu-lated by drugs such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,among which the most potent belong to the statins family
[11-14]. They lower cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme
HMG-CoA reductase, which is rate-limiting.
Effects of statins on cancer activated pathways
Therefore statins are known lipopenic drugs, but they arealso drug candidates against cancer [15]. Intermediate
molecules in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway undergo
important biochemical reactions of prenylation whoseblocking will inactivate several intracellular transductionpathways that involve Ras, Rho and small G proteins [16-Finite state machine of our re gulatory network taken as an example in asynchronous simulationFigure 3
Finite state machine of our regulatory network taken as an example in asynchronous simulation . The state
[1010] colored in green also corresponds to a steady state in
the asynchronous simulation. (All the steady states are the
same in synchronous and asynchronous simulations) The 3 states [0010], [1100], [1011] which correspond to a state cycle in the synchronous simulation are still colored in red, but this figure clearly shows th at they do not correspond to
a state cycle in the asynchronous simulation. Actually, even if
there are several paths enabling to reach cyclically those
three states (one of those paths is indicated with purple arrows), there are also several paths leading to the steady state from which there is no path back to those 3 states.

19]. Hence, statins can block Ras activation, which occurs
in 30% of human tumours. Experimentally, statins can
stop cell growth by blocking cells at the G1 or G2/Mstages, or induce apoptosis in several cancer cell types[20]. Important results have also been obtained usingrodent models where neuroblastoma, colic cancer andmelanoma have regressed under the effect of lovastatin.
Moreover, the combination of classical antineoplastic
drugs, like DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, and statinsincreases tumour cell killing [21,22].
In this paper, we first focus on the synchronous formalism
enabling us to compute our large model of cholesterol
regulatory pathway. We next propose a methodology
based on asynchronous formalism and of Markov chainsto overcome one of its limitations: the appearance of spu-rious cycles.
Methods
Boolean modeling of the human  cholesterol regulatory
pathway
The model shown in figure 4 has been made using data
from the literature [23-25]. It is composed of the choles-terol synthesis pathway and its regulation by SREBPs.
After a few simplifications aimed at reducing the state
space size, our model includes 33 species (genes, mRNAs,
proteins, biochemical intermediates and statins). In par-ticular, we assume the SREBP-SCAP-Insig1 complex to bealways present in the membranes of the endoplasmicreticulum (ER). Therefore, in our model, the SREBP-SCAPcomplex can be either present in the ER if the cholesterol
level is high, or absent if the cholesterol level is below the
physiologically relevant threshold, a situation that occursfollowing its dissociation from Insig. We also assume thatS1p and S2p are always present in the membranes of theGolgi apparatus. Hence, in our model, a non-fullymatured SREBP protein, called here pSREBP (for precur-
sor-SREBP) is automatically produced if SREBP-SCAP is
present. Likewise, matured SREBP, called mSREBP, isautomatically derived from pSREBP and then migrates tothe nucleus to enhance transcription of the genes from theHMG-CoA reductase pathway when cholesterol levels areperceived as insufficient.
Target genes will then be transcribed into their respective
mRNA, which will be translated into the correspondingenzymes. The endogenous cholesterol synthesis startswith acetyl-CoA which can, in our model, be eitherpresent, or absent in case of deficiency. Acetyl-CoA com-bines with itself to give CoA-SH and acetoacetyl-CoA.
Acetyl-CoA reacts then with acetoacetyl-CoA to give
HMG-CoA (3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA). This reac-tion is catalyzed by the HMG-CoA synthase. Therefore,the Boolean formula that describes the evolution of
HMG-CoA is:
HMG_CoA(t+1) = Acetoacetyl_CoA(t) AND
Acetyl_CoA(t) AND HMG_CoA_Synthase(t)
as expressed in the formalism of equation (1).
We assume that NADPH and H+ are always present and
we have chosen not to represent them in our model. Thus,in the presence of HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA willproduce mevalonic acid. ATP is also considered to bepresent in sufficient amounts so that mevalonic acid will
transform into mevalonyl pyrophosphate, which will
then transform into isopentenyl pyrophosphate.
Isopentenyl pyrophosphate will give dimethyl allyl pyro-
phosphate, and then combine with its own product toform geranyl pyrophosphate. This last one will combinewith isopentenyl pyrophosphate to give farnesyl pyro-
phosphate. Farnesyl pyrophosphate will lose two inor-
ganic phosphates and one H+ ion to give presqualenepyrophosphate that will get two hydrogens from NADPHand H+ and lose two more inorganic phosphates to trans-form into squalene.
Since we assume NAPDH and H+ to be always present in
enough quantity, farnesyl pyrophosphate will automati-cally give squalene and presqualene pyrophosphatewhich, as an intermediate of the reaction, is not men-tioned.
The ring closure of squalene produces lanosterol. We have
then omitted several transitions and jumped from thelanosterol to desmosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol, whichboth give cholesterol. The Boolean formula that describesthe formation of cholesterol from either desmosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol is:
Cholesterol(t+1) = Desmosterol(t) OR
7_dehydrocholesterol(t)
Perturbations of the model such as blockade of the HMG-
CoA reductase by statins, widely used hypocholestero-lemic drugs, can be readily modeled. In the case of statins
and HMG-CoA reductase, the Boolean formula is:
HMG_CoA_Reductase(t+1) =
HMG_CoA_Reductase_RNA(t) AND NOT(Statins(t))
Encoding the model
At each time of the simulation the state of the targetedbiological system is represented by a Boolean vector. Eachcoordinate represents a species in the pathway.

Cholesterol Regu latory Pathway Figure 4
Cholesterol Regulatory Pathway . The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is shown on this figure starting by its precursor
Acetyl-CoA. Several of the key enzymes of this pathway regulated by SR EBPs are also shown. The ge netic regulation initiated
by the effect of cholesterol on the Insig-SR EBP-SCAP complex can be seen on the top of this figure. The action of statins,
widely used hypolipidemic drugs, on the HM G-CoA-Reductase enzyme is al so captured in this graph. Species of the model are
grouped into cellular compartmen ts as nucleus, golgi apparatus and endoplasmic re ticulum. Default cellular compartment is the
cytosol. This graphical repr esentation has been prepared with CellDesigner [60,61].

The evolution function takes a Boolean vector represent-
ing the state of the model at time t and returns a Boolean
vector representing the state of the model at time t + 1.
Storing the model
The study of those pathways is greatly facilitated when themodels are stored in a computer-readable format allowing
representation of a biological system. Such formats have
already been proposed like the Systems Biology MarkupLanguage (SBML) [26,27]. SBML files are static represen-tations of biological systems that contain species, reac-tions, kinetic laws and possible annotations. SBMLimplements the XML (Extensible Markup Language)
standard and is now internationally supported and widely
used. It allows models of biological systems to be storedin public or private databases. However, it has beendesigned for the purpose of ODE (Ordinary DifferentialEquations) simulations and thus needs some adaptationsto be used for Boolean simulations, like the possibility tostore Boolean formulae. For our purposes, we have used
SBML files with additional < BooleanLaws > </BooleanLaws >
tags which are stored within reaction tags in an annotatedsection to remain compatible with SBML standard. ThisSBML can be downloaded from the BioModels databasehttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/
[28] and has the follow-
ing submission ID: MODEL0568648427.
Simulation: point and cyclic attractors
In a synchronous simulation, every trajectory converges toan attractor. Indeed, as the state space is finite (its size is2
N with N the number of species in the model), if we keep
the simulation running long enough it will eventually
come back to an already reached state. At that point, the
trajectory becomes periodic because the simulation isdeterministic on a finite state space.
If the periodic part of the trajectory is of size one, we call
the state a point attractor. When the system loops infi-
nitely through several states, we call the set of these states
a cycle attractor.
While non-attractor states are transient and visited at most
once on any network trajectory, states within an attractorcycle or point are reached infinitely often. Thus, attractorsare often identified with phenotypes [2,3]. Considering
that a phenotype is an observable state, therefore stable, of
an organism or a cell, real biological systems are typicallyassumed to have short attractor cycles [29].
The state-space explosion problem
In order to fully analyze the model with a simple simula-
tion approach, we would need to simulate every state of
the state-space. But the size of this space grows exponen-tially with the number of species and thus the computa-tion of the trajectories starting from all possible states willrapidly become too costly. Thus, we have decided, as a
first step prior to a formal analysis, to use a random gen-
erator in order to choose a subset of start states signifi-cantly smaller than the whole state-space and uniformlydistributed in this space. We have also taken advantage ofmultiple processors computing in order to cover the max-imum of the state space with a minimum of time. Algo-
rithms developed for Boolean simulation are very well
suited for parallel execution. For example the set of startstates used for simulation can easily be divided into sub-sets and simulation can be run independently from thosestart subsets. However, we think that parallelization is notsufficient to overcome the combinatorial explosion.
Indeed, in order to add a species to a model, the comput-
ing capabilities must be multiplied by two.
Relative importance of cy cles: A Markovian approach
based on asynchronous perturbations
We propose here a methodology based on Markov proc-
esses that computes the stability of cycles. Markov proc-
esses have already been used for controlling and analyzing
gene networks [30,31]. Our approach differs from what isdone in Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN) by thechoice of the state space: instead of classically using thestate space of the system itself (i.e. the 2
N possible values
of the state vector), we will use the set of state cycles and
equilibria which is typically much smaller [2,3]. This
allows us to compute Markov chain-based algorithms onlarge biological systems and thus to take into account thesubstantial and still growing amount of data we have onthose networks and pathways. However, as a price for scal-ability and unlike PBN, the framework of synchronous
Boolean networks does not represent the possible stochas-
ticity of state transitions. Let S be the set of results of ourBoolean analysis (S is composed of point attractors andcyclic attractors). S is the state-space of the finite discretetime-homogeneous Markov chain we want to study. Inorder to define the transitions of this Markov chain, we
apply a perturbation on each cycle C in S. C has k states ( k
can be 1 in the case of a point attractor), say ( s
1, s2, ..., sk).
For each state si of the cycle ( s1, s2, ..., sk) the perturbation
consists in reevaluating each species by its own Booleanfunction triggered asynchronously. Thus we obtain N new
states ( s
i,1, si,2, ..., si,N) for each state in C. When we perturb
every state with every perturbation, we obtain a new set of
perturbed states of size kN.
We can note here that some of the states in ( si,1, si,2, ..., si,N)
are equal to the perturbed state si. Those states will be
taken into account similarly to the states different from si.
We then simulate synchronously all the states in ( si,1, si,2,
..., si,N) until they reach one of the attractors of the system
(i.e. an element of S). The transition probability from acycle to another is defined as the ratio of the number ofperturbed states of the first cycle that reach the second one
BMC Systems Biology  2008, 2:99 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/99

over the total number of perturbed states of the first cycle.
We also take into account the transitions from a cycle to
itself. By this mean, we add some asynchronous dynamicsin our synchronous analysis. We can then compute thestationary distribution of this Markov process and inter-pret it as a measure of the relative importance of eachcycle. We achieve this computation with an initial vector
of size n and of value [1/ n, 1/n, ..., 1/ n] where n is the size
of S. By this mean, we make sure that all the absorbingstates are taken into consideration. The aim of this meth-odology is to provide a measure of the stability of eachsynchronous attractor, using an asynchronous perturba-tion. Expecting that all the resulting attractors of synchro-
nous Boolean analysis are biologically relevant would
mean that all the biochemical reactions in the networkhappened simultaneously. Yet we know that it is not thecase. Furthermore, it is well known that, within a biologi-cal pathway, some reactions are triggered with higher fre-quency than others (that is why, in the ODE paradigm, alot of systems are stiff). Thus, Boolean analysis should, in
some way, take into consideration the asynchronous char-
acter of biochemical reactions. Under this assumption,asynchronous perturbations seem a logical and conven-ient way to provide a hint of the biological relevance ofthe state cycles found.
Results
Dynamical synchronous analysis of the model
Based on the simulations obtained from 105 random
states (out of 233 . 8.6 × 109 possible states), we predict 3
equilibria or steady states:
 one with the complex SREBP-SCAP-Insig1 activated but
a lack of precursor (Acetyl-CoA) preventing cholesterolsynthesis;
 one with the presence of cholesterol precursor (Acetyl-
CoA), but also the presence of statins blocking the choles-
terol synthesis by inhibiting the HMG-CoA reductase
enzyme;
 and one with a lack of precursor and the presence of stat-
ins.
Furthermore, we found 4 state cycles corresponding to the
physiological regulation of cholesterol synthesis: when
the cholesterol level is too low (equivalent to the absenceof cholesterol in a Boolean formalism) there is activationof the SREBP-SCAP complex and (enhancement of the)production of all the enzymes of the cholesterol synthesisregulated by SREBP. Then, the endogenous synthesis of
cholesterol starts again and when its level becomes too
high (equivalent to the presence of cholesterol in aBoolean formalism) it inhibits the release of the SREBP-SCAP complex and thus the production of the above
enzymes.
Among those 4 cycles one has size 29 (named cycle_0 fur-
ther in this article) and the others have size 33. In the cycleof size 29 the cholesterol changes from false to true (i.e.the cholesterol gets above the threshold indicative of the
activation of its synthesis by the complex SREBP-SCAP-
Insig) only once per cycle, while in the cycles of size 33,the cholesterol becomes true 5 times per cycle.
Results verification through a formal analysis using a SAT
solver
The results detailed in the previous paragraph are
obtained using a start space for the simulation around 105
times smaller than the state space. This method has theadvantage to quickly provide some attractors for the bio-logical system. However, when using a sample of thewhole state space, there is no assurance of finding all thesystem attractors. Formal analysis is one way to ensure
that all the attractors have been found with a computa-
tional cost that could be lower than the cost of performingsimulation on the whole state space. We decided to per-form such a formal analysis by running a SAT solver onour Boolean network. We recall here that the Boolean sat-isfiability problem (commonly called SAT-problem) [32]
determines if there is a set of variables for which a given
Boolean formula can be evaluated to TRUE and identifiesthis precise set if existing. This is an NP-complete problem
for which some instance solvers have been developed. Toachieve this formal analysis, we wrote our system ofBoolean equations into a suitable dimacs file format [33]
(some dimacs files used for simulation can be down-
loaded at http://Bioinformaticsu613.free.fr
). In that way,
we were able to confirm that the only attractors of size 1,29 and 33 were those detected by our simulation tool witha random start space of size 10
5.
Why did we need to go further:  detection of spurious cycles
The simulation performed with our model results in 4
state cycles. We believe that all those cycles do not corre-spond to a phenotype. These outcomes of different simu-lations, which are not biologically relevant, are typical ofthe synchronous Boolean paradigm, and are called spuri-ous cycles [4,5]. Therefore, there is a need to measure the
relative importance of the cycles found using the previous
methods.
Markov chains-based stability analysis of the previous
synchronous simulation
Let us use our stability analysis on the results of the syn-
chronous simulation of the cholesterol regulatory path-
way. We perturb the cyclic attractors found during thissimulation and then simulate synchronously the statesresulting from the perturbation. We interpret the ratio of
BMC Systems Biology  2008, 2:99 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/99

the number of perturbed states of a given cyclic attractor
that reach a second cyclic attractor over the total number
of perturbed states of the given cyclic attractor as a transi-tion probability. Afterwards, we use all the computedtransition probabilities obtained previously to build theMarkov chain shown in figure 5.
The stationary probability vector is [1, 0, 0, 0]. This reflects
the fact that the state cycle 0 is absorbing (i.e. it has nooutgoing transitions). We interpret this result as statecycles 1, 2 and 3 are spurious.Markov chains-based stability an alysis of simple regulatory
networks
Furthermore, to validate our method of Markov chains-
based stability analysis, we applied it on simple positiveand negative regulatory loops of different sizes, which arewell known to contain spurious cycles. In the example ofa negative feedback loop of size 3, the state cycle {010,
101} is found in synchronous simulation but does not
exist in asynchronous simulation. It is obviously spurious,as detected by our method. All the detailed results andgraphs can be found on our web site: http://
bioinformaticsu613.free.fr/simpleloopsn3.html .
Markov chain of the transition pr obabilities between state cycles in the cholesterol regulatory pathway Figure 5
Markov chain of the transition pr obabilities between state cycles in the choleste rol regulatory pathway . Let k be
the number of states within an attractor ( k can be 1 in the case of a point attractor) and N be the number of species in the
model. For each attractor of this  finite time-homogeneous Markov chain, we perturb each species of each state by triggering its
own Boolean function asynchronously. Thus there are kN perturbations per attractor. In th e cholesterol regulatory pathway,
one cyclic attractor found by the synchronous analysis has 29 st ates and the three other cyclic attractors have 33 states. The
number of species in the model is 33. Th e weight of the edge from an attractor X to an attractor Y is the ratio between the
number of perturbations of X which lead to Y over the total number of perturbations of X.Cycle 0 Cycle 1

When we perform this analysis on our example of a sim-
ple regulatory network (figures 1, 2 and 3) we obtain the
results shown in table 2. The transition probabilities asso-ciated to the simple regulatory network shown in table 1allow us to build the Markov chain shown in figure 6. Theresulting stationary distribution of the Markov chainshown in figure 6 is [1, 0]. Thus we interpret the state cycle
of our simple regulatory network as spurious.
Benchmarking of our method
The lack of a common file format for qualitative analysis
is an important issue for the benchmark of such methods.This is clearly stated in the article about the SQUAD soft-
ware by Di Cara et al [34]: " With the increase of published
signaling networks, it will be possible in the future to realize abenchmark among these software packages to compare theirstrengths and weaknesses. For doing that, however, it would bevery useful to develop a common file format ." Since Di Cara's
article, this issue of a common file format for qualitativeanalysis is still important because the current SBML for-
mat cannot encode logical models. However, work is
ongoing to extend SBML such that version 3 could sup-port information for qualitative simulation. The solutionwe have found to overcome this current limitation was touse a proprietary annotation with a specific namespace toremain compatible with the SBML standard. This allowed
us to read and write annotated SBML files from our com-
putational tool. However, other software cannot use ourannotated SBML to perform the qualitative analysis of abiological network, unless specific code is developed toread our annotations. SQUAD can generate SBML, but itcannot use its own generated SBML to perform qualitative
analysis. All the information concerning qualitative anal-
ysis is stored only in MML files (the file format used bySQUAD). This is why we could not use the current SBML
version to perform the benchmark.
Furthermore, except for some well-known problems
which have been well formulated and thus accepted bythe community (like the test for Initial Value Problems(IVPs) solvers of the Bari University [35] or the ISCAS89
benchmark for circuits [36]), any type of benchmark
would be partial and its results could be seen as unfair byother authors. For example, as mentioned by Naldi et al.in [37], some methods are only suited for a subset of bio-logical problems: " Garg et al. have already represented
Boolean state transition graphs in terms of BDD. They consid-
ered the particular case of networks where genes are expressed
provided all their inhibitors are absent and at least one of theiractivators is present " [7]. The Naldi et al.'s method, regard-
less of its computational efficiency, is a more powerfulmodeling tool thanks to the use of logical evolution rulesand multi-valued species. Even if it is always possible touse Boolean formalism to model multi-valued networks
(by leveraging the number of Boolean species by the
number of wished values, e.g.{Boolean_species_A_low_level,Boolean_species_A_middle_level,Boolean_species_A_high_level}), the use of multi-valuedlogical networks greatly eases the modeling process.
However, despite all the restrictions discussed above, we
believe that benchmarking our method is an importantissue. We have then developed a program that generates arandom network whose size is a user input. For the sakeof simplicity, the obtained network contains species that
can have 0, 1, 2 or 3 species influencing it. This means
that, to compute the state of a species at time t + 1, we only

This table shows both the princip le of our newly introduced stab ility analysis and it s application on the simple regulatory net work shown in figure 1.
It has 2 main columns: the stea dy state column and the state cycle column. As the state cycle  found during the dynamical synchr onous analysis
contains 3 states (see figure 2), the last  column is divided into 3 sub-columns. In  the line "Perturbed states and their limit cycles" we show the
perturbation results of each state of each attractor by re-eva luating each species by its own Boolean function triggered asynch ronously.
Perturbations are done from species A to species D. There are 4 species in our simple regulatory  model, therefore 4 new states are generated
from 1 perturbed state. We then synchronously simulate each new state and note if their simulation  leads to the attractor they are derived from or
to the other attractor of the system. In other words, we watch in  which basin of attraction are those new states (see figure 2) . The arrows
following by "SC" (state cycle) or  "SS" (steady state) give those responses. For the steady state no perturbation has an effect  because a steady state
in synchronous analysis remains a steady st ate in asynchronous analysis. Thus we si mplify the presentation, showing that all th e perturbations
applied to state [1010] leave this state unchanged.

need to know the state of a maximum of 3 other species at
time t. Our benchmarking tool has 3 parameters that can
modify the connection density of the network :
 the probability of being a "source" (i.e. the probability
for a species to be influenced by no other species in thenetwork),
 the probability to be under the influence of only one
other species in the network,
 the probability to be under the influence of exactly two
other species in the network.
The complementary probability is the probability for a
species to be influenced by three other species in the net-
work.
Then our benchmarking tool generates the files describing
this network for our software as well as in MML andGINML formats for SQUAD [34,38] and GINsim [39,40],respectively.We have analyzed networks of sizes ranging from 33 (the
number of species in our cholesterol regulatory pathway)up to 2500 species.
The CPU times obtained with our method on a Intel
®
Core™ 2 Duo E6600 processor (2.4 GHz) with 2 GBytes of
RAM are shown in table 3. The performance of othertested software did not compare favorably with our appli-cation. With GINsim, we were able to simulate networksas large as 1000 species, but we obtained an "out of mem-
ory" error message for the network of 2500 species. When
we used the SQUAD software, we were unable to simulatea network of 1000 species or above. It is however possiblethat the parameters used to build the automatically gener-ated networks might have an impact on the results of thebenchmarking. Nevertheless, under the conditions used,
our application is appropriate for the analysis of large bio-
logical networks.
Discussion
The results reported here are in accordance with the bio-logical knowledge we have on the cholesterol biosynthe-sis pathway. The steady states found correspond to either
a lack of precursor (Acetyl-CoA) or arise from the effect of
statins blocking the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol,Markov chain of the transition  probabilities between the steady state and th e state cycle in our simple regulatory network Figure 6

Abstract
The blood cancer T cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia is a chronic disease characterized by a clonal
proliferation of cytotoxic T cells. As no curative therapy is yet known for this disease, identification of potential therapeutic
targets is of immense importance. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive dynamical and structural analysis of anetwork model of this disease. By employing a network reduction technique, we identify the stationary states (fixed points)
of the system, representing normal and diseased (T-LGL) behavior, and analyze their precursor states (basins of attraction)
using an asynchronous Boolean dynamic framework. This analysis identifies the T-LGL states of 54 components of thenetwork, out of which 36 (67%) are corroborated by previous experimental evidence and the rest are novel predictions. Wefurther test and validate one of these newly identified states experimentally. Specifically, we verify the prediction that the
node SMAD is over-active in leukemic T-LGL by demonstrating the predominant phosphorylation of the SMAD family
members Smad2 and Smad3. Our systematic perturbation analysis using dynamical and structural methods leads to theidentification of 19 potential therapeutic targets, 68% of which are corroborated by experimental evidence. The noveltherapeutic targets provide valuable guidance for wet-bench experiments. In addition, we successfully identify two new
candidates for engineering long-lived T cells necessary for the delivery of virus and cancer vaccines. Overall, this study
provides a bird’s-eye-view of the avenues available for identification of therapeutic targets for similar diseases throughperturbation of the underlying signal transduction network.

Introduction
Living cells perceive and respond to environmental perturba-
tions in order to maintain their functional capabilities, such as
growth, survival, and apoptosis. This process is carried out
through a cascade of interactions forming complex signaling
networks. Dysregulation (abnormal expression or activity) of some
components in these signaling networks affects the efficacy ofsignal transduction and may eventually trigger a transition from
the normal physiological state to a dysfunctional system [1]
manifested as diseases such as diabetes [2,3], developmental
disorders [4], autoimmunity [5] and cancer [4,6]. For example,
the blood cancer T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL)leukemia exhibits an abnormal proliferation of mature cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTLs). Normal CTLs are generated to eliminate
cells infected by a virus, but unlike normal CTLs which undergo
activation-induced cell death after they successfully fight the virus,
leukemic T-LGL cells remain long-term competent [7]. The causeof this abnormal behavior has been identified as dysregulation of afew components of the signal transduction network responsible for
activation-induced cell death in T cells [8].
Network representation, wherein the system’s components are
denoted as nodes and their interactions as edges, provides a
powerful tool for analyzing many complex systems [9,10,11]. In
particular, network modeling has recently found ever-increasing
applications in understanding the dynamic behavior of intracel-
lular biological systems in response to environmental stimuli andinternal perturbations [12,13,14]. The paucity of knowledge on
the biochemical kinetic parameters required for continuous
models has called for alternative dynamic approaches. Among
the most successful approaches are discrete dynamic models in
which each component is assumed to have a finite number ofqualitative states, and the regulatory interactions are described by
logical functions [15]. The simplest discrete dynamic models are
the so-called Boolean models that assume only two states (ON or
OFF) for each component. These models were originally
introduced by S. Kauffman and R. Thomas to provide a coarse-grained description of gene regulatory networks [16,17].

A Boolean network model of T cell survival signaling in the
context of T-LGL leukemia was previously constructed by Zhang
et al[18] through performing an extensive literature search. This
network consists of 60 components, including proteins, mRNAs,and small molecules (see Figure 1). The main input to the network
is ‘‘Stimuli’’, which represents virus or antigen stimulation, and the
main output node is ‘‘Apoptosis’’, which denotes programmed celldeath. Based on a random order asynchronous Boolean dynamic
model of the assembled network, Zhang et alidentified a minimal
number of dysregulations that can cause the T-LGL survival state,namely overabundance or overactivity of the proteins platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF) and interleukin 15 (IL15). Zhang
et alcarried out a preliminary analysis of the network’s dynamics
by performing numerical simulations starting from one specific
initial condition (corresponding to resting T cells receiving antigen
stimulation and over-abundance of the two proteins PDGF andIL15). Once the known deregulations in T-LGL leukemia were
reproduced, each of these deregulations was interrupted individ-
ually, by setting the node’s status to the opposite state, to predictkey mediators of the disease. Yet, a complete dynamic analysis of
the system, including identification of the attractors (e.g. steady
states) of the system and their corresponding basin of attraction(precursor states), as well as a thorough perturbation analysis of the
system considering all possible initial states, is lacking. Performing
this analysis can provide deeper insights into unknown aspects ofT-LGL leukemia.
Stuck-at-ON/OFF fault is a very common dysregulation of
biomolecules in various cancer diseases [19]. For example, stuck-
at-ON (constitutive activation) of the RAS protein in the mitogen-
activated protein kinase pathways leads to aberrant cell prolifer-ation and cancer [19,20]. Thus identifying components whose
stuck-at values result in the clearance, or alternatively, the
persistence of a disease is extremely beneficial for the design ofintervention strategies. As there is no known curative therapy for
T-LGL leukemia, identification of potential therapeutic targets is
of utmost importance [21].
In this paper, we carry out a detailed analysis of the T-LGL
signaling network by considering all possible initial states to probe
the long-term behavior of the underlying disease. We employ anasynchronous Boolean dynamic framework and a network
reduction method, which we previously proposed [22], to identifythe attractors of the system and analyze their basins of attraction.
This analysis allows us to confirm or predict the T-LGL states of
54 components of the network. The predicted state of one of the
components (SMAD) is validated by new wet-bench experiments.We then perform node perturbation analysis using the dynamicapproach and a structural method proposed in [23] to study towhat extent does each component contribute to T-LGL leukemia.Both methods give consistent results and together identify 19 keycomponents whose disruption can reverse the abnormal state ofthe signaling network, thereby uncovering potential therapeutictargets for this disease, some of which are also corroborated by
experimental evidence.
Materials and Methods
Any biological regulatory network can be represented by a
directed graph G=(V,E) where V={v1,v2,…, vn} is the set of
vertices (nodes) describing different components of the system, andEis the set of edges denoting the regulatory interactions among the
components. The orientation of each edge in the network follows
the direction of mass transfer or information propagation from theupstream to the downstream node. Each edge can be alsocharacterized with a sign where a positive sign denotes activationand a negative sign signifies inhibition. The source nodes (i.e.nodes with no incoming edges) of this graph, if they exist, representexternal inputs (signals), and one or more nodes, usually sink nodes(i.e. nodes with no outgoing edges), are customarily designated asoutputs of the network.
Boolean dynamic models
Boolean models belong to the class of discrete dynamic models
in which each node of the network is characterized by an ON (1)
or OFF (0) state and usually the time variable tis also considered to
be discrete, i.e. it takes nonnegative integer values [24,25]. Thefuture state of each node v
iis determined by the current states of
the nodes regulating it according to a Boolean transfer functionf
i:f0,1gki?f0,1g, where kiis the number of regulators of vi. Each
Boolean function (rule) represents the regulatory relationshipsbetween the components and is usually expressed via the logicaloperators AND, OR and NOT. The state of the system at each
time step is denoted by a vector whose i
thcomponent represents
the state of node viat that time step. The discrete state space of a
system can be represented by a state transition graph whose nodesare states of the system and edges are allowed transitions amongthe states. By updating the nodes’ states at each time step, the stateof the system evolves over time and following a trajectory of statesit eventually settles down into an attractor. An attractor can be inthe form of either a fixed point, in which the state of the systemdoes not change, or a complex attractor, where the system
oscillates (regularly or irregularly) among a set of states. The set of
states leading to a specific attractor is called the basin of attractionof that attractor.
In order to evaluate the state of each node at a given time
instant, synchronous as well as asynchronous updating strategieshave been proposed [24,25]. In the synchronous method all nodes
of the network are updated simultaneously at multiples of a
common time step. The underlying assumption of this updatemethod is that the timescales of all the processes occurring in asystem are similar. This is a quite strong and potentially unrealisticassumption, which in particular may not be suited for intracellularbiological processes due to the variety of timescales associated withtranscription, translation and post-translational mechanisms [26].To overcome this limitation, various asynchronous methods havebeen proposed wherein the nodes are updated based on individualAuthor Summary
T-LGL leukemia is a blood cancer characterized by an
abnormal increase in the abundance of a type of white
blood cell called T cell. Since there is no known curative
therapy for this disease, identification of potential thera-peutic targets is of utmost importance. Experimentalidentification of manipulations capable of reversing the
disease condition is usually a long, arduous process.
Mathematical modeling can aid this process by identifyingpotential therapeutic interventions. In this work, we carryout a systematic analysis of a network model of T cell
survival in T-LGL leukemia to get a deeper insight into the
unknown facets of the disease. We identify the T-LGLstatus of 54 components of the system, out of which 36
(67%) are corroborated by previous experimental evidence
and the rest are novel predictions, one of which wevalidate by follow-up experiments. By deciphering thestructure and dynamics of the underlying network, we
identify component perturbations that lead to pro-
grammed cell death, thereby suggesting several novelcandidate therapeutic targets for future experiments.Dynamical and Structural Analysis of T-LGL Network

timescales [25,27,28,29,30], including deterministic methods with
fixed node timescales and stochastic methods such as randomorder asynchronous method [27] wherein the nodes are updated
in random permutations. In a previous work [22], we carried out a
comparative study of three different asynchronous methodsapplied to the same biological system. That study suggested thatthe general asynchronous (GA) method, wherein a randomly
selected node is updated at each time step, is the most efficient and
informative asynchronous updating strategy. This is becausedeterministic asynchronous [22] or autonomous [30] Boolean
models require kinetic or timing knowledge, which is usually
missing, and random order asynchronous models [27] are notcomputationally efficient compared to the GA models. In addition,the superiority of the GA approach has been corroborated byother researchers [29] and the method has been used in other
studies as well [31,32]. We thus chose to employ the GA methodin this work, and we implemented it using the open-source
software library BooleanNet [33]. It is important to note that the
stochasticity inherent to this method may cause each state to havemultiple successors, and thus the basins of attraction of differentattractors may overlap. For systems with multiple fixed-point
attractors, the absorption probabilities to each fixed point can be
computed through the analysis of the Markov chain and transitionmatrix associated with the state transition graph of the system [34].
Given a fixed point, node perturbations can be performed by
reversing the state of the nodes i.e. by knocking out the nodes thatstabilize in an ON state in the fixed point or over-expressing theones that stabilize in an OFF state.

Network reduction
A Boolean network with nnodes has a total of 2nstates. This
exponential dependence makes it computationally intractable to
map the state transition graphs of even relatively small networks.
This calls for developing efficient network reduction approaches.Recent efforts towards addressing this challenge consists of iteratively
removing single nodes that do not regulate their own function and
simplifying the redundant transfer functions using Boolean algebra
[35,36]. Naldi et al[35] proved that this approach preserves the fixed
points of the system and that for each (irregular) complex attractor in
the original asynchronous model there is at least one complex
attractor in the reduced model (i.e. network reduction may create
spurious oscillations). Boolean networks often contain nodes whose
states stabilize in an attracting state after a transient period,
regardless of updating strategy or initial conditions. The attracting
states of these nodes can be readily identified by inspection of their
Boolean functions. In a previous work [22] we proposed a method of
network simplification by ( i) pinpointing and eliminating these
stabilized nodes and ( ii) iteratively removing a simple mediator node
(e.g. a node that has one incoming edge and one outgoing edge) and
connecting its input(s) to its target(s). Our simplification method
shares similarities with the method proposed in [35,36], with the
difference that we only remove stabilized nodes (which have the
same state on every attractor) and simple mediator nodes rather than
eliminating each node without a self loop. Thus their proof regarding
the preservation of the steady states by the reduction method holds
true in our case. We employed this simplification method for the
analysis of a signal transduction network in plants and verified by
using numerical simulations that it preserves the attractors of that
system. In this work, we employ this reduction method to simplify the
T-LGL leukemia signal transduction network synthesized by Zhang
et al[18], thereby facilitating its dynamical analysis. We also note that
the first step of our simplification method is similar to the logical
steady state analysis implemented in the software tool CellNetAna-
lyzer [37,38]. We thus refer to this step as logical steady state analysis
throughout the paper.
Identification of attractors
It should be noted that the fixed points of a Boolean network are
the same for both synchronous and asynchronous methods. In
order to obtain the fixed points of a system one can solve the set of
Boolean equations independent of time. To this end, we first fix
the state of the source nodes. We then determine the nodes whose
rules depend on the source nodes and will either stabilize in an
attracting state after a time delay or otherwise their rules can be
simplified significantly by plugging in the state of the source nodes.
Iteratively inserting the states of stabilized nodes in the rules (i.e.
employing logical steady state analysis) will result in either the
fixed point(s) of the system, or the partial fixed point(s) and a
remaining set of equations to be solved. In the latter case, if the
remaining set of equations is too large to obtain its fixed point(s)
analytically, we take advantage of the second step of our reduction
method [22] to simplify the resulting network and to determine a
simpler set of Boolean rules. By solving this simpler set of
equations (or performing numerical simulations, if necessary) and
plugging the solutions into the original rules, we can then find the
states of the removed nodes and determine the attractors of the
whole system accordingly. For the analysis of basins of attraction
of the attractors, we perform numerical simulations using the GA
update method.
A structural method for identifying essential components
The topology (structure) and the function of biological networks
are closely related. Therefore, structural analysis of biologicalnetworks provides an alternative way to understand their function
[39,40]. We have recently proposed an integrative method to
identify the essential components of any given signal transduction
network [23]. The starting point of the method is to represent the
combinatorial relationship of multiple regulatory interactions
converging on a node vby a Boolean rule:
v~(u11AND :::AND u1n1)O R( u21AND :::AND u2n2)
OR :::OR ( um1AND :::AND umnm)
where uij’s are regulators of node v. The method consists of two
main steps. The first step is the expansion of a signaling network to
a new representation by incorporating the sign of the interactions
as well as the combinatorial nature of multiple converging
interactions. This is achieved by introducing a complementary
node for each component that plays a role in negative regulations
(NOT operation) as well as introducing a composite node to
denote conditionality among two or more edges (AND operation).
This step eliminates the distinction of the edge signs; that is, all
directed edges in the expanded network denote activation. In
addition, the AND and OR operators can be readily distinguished
in the expanded network, i.e., multiple edges ending at compositenodes are added by the AND operator, while multiple edges
ending at original or complementary nodes are cumulated by the
OR operator. The second step is to model the cascading effects
following the loss of a node by an iterative process that identifies
and removes nodes that have lost their indispensable regulators.
These two steps allow ranking of the nodes by the effects of their
loss on the connectivity between the network’s input(s) and
output(s). We proposed two connectivity measures in [23], namely
the simple path (SP) measure, which counts the number of all
simple paths from inputs to outputs, and a graph measure based
on elementary signaling modes (ESMs), defined as a minimal set of
components that can perform signal transduction from initial
signals to cellular responses. We found that the combinatorial
aspects of ESMs pose a substantial obstacle to counting them in
large networks and that the SP measure has a similar performance
as the ESM measure since both measures incorporate the
cascading effects of a node’s removal arising from the synergistic
relations between multiple interactions. Therefore, we employ the
SP measure and define the importance value of a component vas:
E
SP(v)~NSP(Gexp){NSP(GDv)
NSP(Gexp)
where NSP(Gexp)a n d NSP(GDv) denote the total number of simple
paths from the input(s) to the output(s) in the original expanded
network Gexpand the damaged network GDvupon disruption of node
v, respectively. This essentiality measure takes values in the interval
[0,1], with 1 indicating a node whose loss causes the disruption of all
paths between the input and output node(s). In this paper, we also
make use of this structural method to identify essential components
of the T-LGL leukemia signaling network. We then relate the
importance value of nodes to the effects of their knockout (sustainedOFF state) in the dynamic model and the importance value of
complementary nodes to the effects of their original nodes’
constitutive activation (sustained ON state) in the dynamic model.

Network simplification and dynamic analysis
The T-LGL signaling network reconstructed by Zhang et al[18]
contains 60 nodes and 142 regulatory edges. Zhang et al used a
two-step process: they first synthesized a network containing 128nodes and 287 edges by extensive literature search, then simplifiedit with the software NET-SYNTHESIS [42], which constructs thesparsest network that maintains all of the causal (upstream-downstream) effects incorporated in a redundant starting network.In this study, we work with the 60-node T-LGL signaling networkreported in [18], which is redrawn in Figure 1. The Boolean rulesfor the components of the network were constructed in [18] bysynthesizing experimental observations and for convenience are
given in Table S1 as well. The description of the node names and
abbreviations are provided in Table S2.
To reduce the computational burden associated with the large
state space (more than 10
18states for 60 nodes), we simplified the
T-LGL network using the reduction method proposed in [22] (seeMaterials and Methods). We fixed the six source nodes in the statesgiven in [18], i.e. Stimuli, IL15, and PDGF were fixed at ON andStimuli2, CD45, and TAX were fixed at OFF. We used theBoolean rules constructed in [18], with one notable difference.The Boolean rules for all the nodes in [18], except Apoptosis,contain the expression ‘‘AND NOT Apoptosis’’, meaning that ifApoptosis is ON, the cell dies and correspondingly all other nodesare turned OFF. To focus on the trajectory leading to the initial
turning on of the Apoptosis node, we removed the ‘‘AND NOT
Apoptosis’’ from all the logical rules. This allows us to determinethe stationary states of the nodes in a live cell. We determinedwhich nodes’ states stabilize using the first step of oursimplification method, i.e. logical steady state analysis (seeMaterials and Methods). Our analysis revealed that 36 nodes of
the network stabilize in either an ON or OFF state. In particular,
Proliferation and Cytoskeleton signaling, two output nodes of the
network, stabilize in the OFF and ON state, respectively. Low
proliferation in leukemic LGL has been observed experimentally[43], which supports our finding of a long-term OFF state for this
output node. The ON state of Cytoskeleton signaling may not be
biologically relevant as this node represents the ability of T cells to
attach and move which is expected to be reduced in leukemic T-
LGL compared to normal T cells. The nodes whose stabilized
states cannot be readily obtained by inspection of their Boolean
rules form the sub-network represented in Figure 2A. The Booleanrules of these nodes are listed in Table S3 wherein we put back the
‘‘AND NOT Apoptosis’’ expression into the rules.
Next, we identified the attractors (long-term behavior) of the
sub-network represented in Figure 2A (see Materials and
Methods). We found that upon activation of Apoptosis all other
nodes stabilize at OFF, forming the normal fixed point of the
system, which represents the normal behavior of programmed cell
death. When Apoptosis is stabilized at OFF, the two nodes in the
top sub-graph oscillate while all the nodes in the bottom sub-graphare stabilized at either ON or OFF. As shown in Figure 3, the state
space of the two oscillatory nodes, TCR and CTLA4, forms a
complex attractor in which the average fraction of ON states for
either node is 0.5. Given that these two nodes have no effect on
any other node under the conditions studied here (i.e. stable states
of the source nodes), their behavior can be separated from the rest
of the network.
The bottom sub-graph exhibits the normal fixed point, as well
as two T-LGL (disease) fixed points in which Apoptosis is OFF.
The only difference between the two T-LGL fixed points is that
the node P2 is ON in one fixed point and OFF in the other, which
was expected due to the presence of a self-loop on P2 in Figure 2A.
P2 is a virtual node introduced to mediate the inhibition of
interferon- ctranslation in the case of sustained activity of the
interferon- cprotein (IFNG in Figure 2A). The node IFNG is also
inhibited by the node SMAD which stabilizes in the ON state in
both T-LGL fixed points. Therefore IFNG stabilizes at OFF,
irrespective of the state of P2, as supported by experimental
evidence [44]. Thus the biological difference between the two
fixed points is essentially a memory effect, i.e. the ON state of P2
indicates that IFNG was transiently ON before stabilizing in theOFF state. In the two T-LGL fixed points for the bottom sub-
graph of Figure 2A, the nodes sFas, GPCR, S1P, SMAD, MCL1,
FLIP, and IAP are ON and the other nodes are OFF. We found
by numerical simulations using the GA method (see Materials and
Methods) that out of 65,536 total states in the state transition
graph, 53% are in the exclusive basin of attraction of the normal
fixed point, 0.24% are in the exclusive basin of attraction of the T-LGL fixed point wherein P2 is ON and 0.03% are in the exclusive
basin of attraction of the T-LGL fixed point wherein P2 is OFF.
Interestingly, there is a significant overlap among the basins of
attraction of all the three fixed points. The large basin of attraction
of the normal fixed point is partly due to the fact that all the states
having Apoptosis in the ON state (that is, half of the total number
of states) belong to the exclusive basin of the normal fixed point.These states are not biologically relevant initial conditions but they
represent potential intermediary states toward programmed cell
death and as such they need to be included in the state transition
graph.
Since the state transition graph of the bottom sub-graph given
in Figure 2A is too large to represent and to further analyze (e.g. to
obtain the probabilities of reaching each of the fixed points), weapplied the second step of the network reduction method proposedDynamical and Structural Analysis of T-LGL Network

in [22]. This step preserves the fixed points of the system (see
Materials and Methods), and since the only attractors of this sub-graph are fixed points, the state space of the reduced network isexpected to reflect the properties of the full state space.Correspondingly, the nodes having in-degree and out-degree ofone (or less) in the sub-graph on Figure 2A, such as sFas, MCL1,IAP, GPCR, SMAD, and CREB, can be safely removed withoutlosing any significant information as such nodes at most introducea delay in the signal propagation. In addition, we note thatalthough the node P2 has a self-loop and generates a new T-LGLfixed point as described before, it can also be removed from thenetwork since the two fixed points differ only in the state of P2 andthus correspond to biologically equivalent disease states. We revisitthis node when enumerating the attractors of the original network.In the resulting simplified network, the nodes BID, Caspase, andIFNG would also have in-degree and out-degree of one (or less)and thus can be safely removed as well. This reduction procedureresults in a simple sub-network represented in Figure 2B with theBoolean rules given in Table 1.
Our attractor analysis revealed that this sub-network has two
fixed points, namely 000001 and 110000 (the digits from left toright represent the state of the nodes in the order as listed from topto bottom in Table 1). The first fixed point represents the normalstate, that is, the apoptosis of CTL cells. Note that the OFF state ofother nodes in this fixed point was expected because of thepresence of ‘‘AND NOT Apoptosis’’ in all the Boolean rules. Thesecond fixed point is the T-LGL (disease) one as Apoptosis is
stabilized in the OFF state. We note that the sub-network depictedin Figure 2B contains a backbone of activations from Fas toApoptosis and two nodes (S1P and FLIP) which both have amutual inhibitory relationship with the backbone. If activationreaches Apoptosis, the system converges to the normal fixed point.In the T-LGL fixed point, on the other hand, the backbone isinactive while S1P and FLIP are active.
We found by simulations that for the simplified network of
Figure 2B, 56% of the states of the state transition graph(represented in Figure 4) are in the exclusive basin of attraction ofthe normal fixed point while 5% of the states form the exclusivebasin of attraction of the T-LGL fixed point. Again, the half ofstate space that has the ON state of Apoptosis belongs to theexclusive basin of attraction of the normal fixed point. Notably,
there is a significant overlap between the basins of attraction of the
two fixed points, which is illustrated by a gray color in Figure 4.The probabilities of reaching each of the two fixed points startingfrom these gray-colored states, found by analysis of thecorresponding Markov chain (see Materials and Methods), aregiven in Figure 5. As this figure represents, for the majority of casesthe probability of reaching the normal fixed point is higher thanthat of the T-LGL fixed point. The three states whose probabilitiesto reach the T-LGL fixed point are greater than or equal to 0.7 areone step away either from the T-LGL fixed point or from thestates in its exclusive basin of attraction. In two of them, the

backbone of the network in Figure 2B is inactive, and in the third
one the backbone is partially inactive and most likely will remaininactive due to the ON state of S1P (one of the two nodes havingmutual inhibition with the backbone).
Based on the sub-network analysis and considering the states of
the nodes that stabilized at the beginning based on the logicalsteady state analysis, we conclude that the whole T-LGL networkhas three attractors, namely the normal fixed point whereinApoptosis is ON and all other nodes are OFF, representing thenormal physiological state, and two T-LGL attractors in which allnodes except two, i.e. TCR and CTLA4, are in a steady state,representing the disease state. These T-LGL attractors are given inthe second column of Table 2, which presents the predicted T-LGL states of 54 components of the network (all but the six sourcenodes whose state is indicated at the beginning of the Resultssection). We note that the two T-LGL attractors essentiallyrepresent the same disease state since they only differ in the state of
the virtual node P2. Moreover, this disease state can be considered
as a fixed point since only two nodes oscillate in the T-LGL
attractors. For this reason we will refer to this state as the T-LGL
fixed point. It is expected that the basins of attraction of the fixed
points have similar features as those of the simplified networks.
Experimental validation of the T-LGL steady state
Experimental evidence exists for the deregulated states of 36
(67%) components out of the 54 predicted T-LGL states as
summarized in the third column of Table 2. For example, the
stable ON state of MEK, ERK, JAK, and STAT3 indicates that
the MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways are activated. The OFF
state of BID is corroborated by recent evidence that it is down-
regulated both in natural killer (NK) and in T cell LGL leukemia
[45]. In addition, the node RAS was found to be constitutively
active in NK-LGL leukemia [41], which indirectly supports our
result on the predicted ON state of this node. For three other
components, namely, GPCR, DISC, and IFNG, which were
classified as being deregulated without clear evidence of either up-
regulation or down-regulation in [18], we found that they
eventually stabilize at ON, OFF, and OFF, respectively. The
OFF state of IFNG and DISC is indeed supported by
experimental evidence [44,46]. In the second column of Table 2,
we indicated with an asterisk the stabilized state of 17 components
that were experimentally undocumented before and thus arepredictions of our steady state analysis (P2 was not included as it is
a virtual node). We note that ten of these cases were also predicted
in [18] by simulations.
The predicted T-LGL states of these 17 components can guide
targeted experimental follow-up studies. As an example of this
approach, we tested the predicted over-activity of the node SMAD
(see Materials and Methods). As described in [18] the SMAD node
represents a merger of SMAD family members Smad 2, 3, and 4.
Smad 2 and 3 are receptor-regulated signaling proteins which are
phosphorylated and activated by type I receptor kinases while
Smad4 is an unregulated co-mediator [47]. Phosphorylated
Smad2 and/or Smad3 form heterotrimeric complexes with Smad4
and these complexes translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene
expression. Thus an ON state of SMAD in the model is a
representation of the predominance of phosphorylated Smad2
and/or phosphorylated Smad3 in T-LGL cells. In relative terms as
compared to normal (resting or activated) T cells, the predicted
ON state implies a higher level of phosphorylated Smad2/3 in T-
LGL cells as compared to normal T cells. Indeed, as shown inFigure 6, T cells of T-LGL patients tend to have high levels of
phosphorylated Smad2/3, while normal activated T cells have
essentially no phosphorylated Smad2/3. Thus our experiments
validate the theoretical prediction.
Node perturbations
A question of immense biological importance is which
manipulations of the T-LGL network can result in consistent
activation-induced cell death and the elimination of the dysreg-
ulated (diseased) behavior. We can rephrase and specify this
question as which node perturbations (knockouts or constitutive
activations) lead to a system that has only the normal fixed point.These perturbations can serve as candidates for potential
therapeutic interventions. To this end, we performed node
perturbation analysis using both structural and dynamic methods.
Structural perturbation analysis. For the structural
analysis, using the T-LGL network (Figure 1) and the Boolean
rules (Table S1), we constructed an expanded T-LGL survival
signaling network (see Materials and Methods) as represented in
Figure 3. The state transition graph corresponding to the two
oscillatory nodes, CTLA4 and TCR. In this graph the left binary digit
of the node identifier indicates the state of CTLA4 and the right digitrepresents the state of TCR. The directed edges represent statetransitions allowed by updating a single node’s state; self-loops appearwhen a node is updated but its state does not change.

Figure S1. In order to evaluate the importance of signaling
components mediating T-LGL leukemia, we introduced thecomplementary node of Apoptosis (denoted by ,Apoptosis in
Figure S1) as an output representing the survival of the CTL cells,which is activated by the complementary node of Caspase(denoted by ,Caspase in Figure S1). The reason is that we are
interested in the question of how to make this outcome (i.e., thedisease state) disappear, or in graph terminology, disconnectedfrom the inputs of the network. In order to count all the simple
paths from a single (rather than multiple) input signal to the outputnode, we fixed the states of Stimuli and IL15 at ON and those ofStimuli2, CD45, and TAX at OFF. Once the Boolean rules weresimplified, we determined all the signaling paths from PDGF tothe output node ,Apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that the
number of signaling paths from PDGF to ,Apoptosis is much
smaller than the number of signaling paths from PDGF to

Abstract
Co-infections alter the host immune response but how the systemic and local processes at the site of infection interact is
still unclear. The majority of studies on co-infections concentrate on one of the infecting species, an immune function orgroup of cells and often focus on the initial phase of the infection. Here, we used a combination of experiments andmathematical modelling to investigate the network of immune responses against single and co-infections with the
respiratory bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica and the gastrointestinal helminth Trichostrongylus retortaeformis . Our goal
was to identify representative mediators and functions that could capture the essence of the host immune response as awhole, and to assess how their relative contribution dynamically changed over time and between single and co-infectedindividuals. Network-based discrete dynamic models of single infections were built using current knowledge of bacterial
and helminth immunology; the two single infection models were combined into a co-infection model that was then verified
by our empirical findings. Simulations showed that a T helper cell mediated antibody and neutrophil response led tophagocytosis and clearance of B. bronchiseptica from the lungs. This was consistent in single and co-infection with no
significant delay induced by the helminth. In contrast, T. retortaeformis intensity decreased faster when co-infected with the
bacterium. Simulations suggested that the robust recruitment of neutrophils in the co-infection, added to the activation of
IgG and eosinophil driven reduction of larvae, which also played an important role in single infection, contributed to thisfast clearance. Perturbation analysis of the models, through the knockout of individual nodes (immune cells), identified the
cells critical to parasite persistence and clearance both in single and co-infections. Our integrated approach captured the
within-host immuno-dynamics of bacteria-helminth infection and identified key components that can be crucial forexplaining individual variability between single and co-infections in natural populations.

Introduction
Hosts that are immunologically challenged by one infection often
show increased susceptibility to a second infectious agent, whether amicro- or a macro-parasite. Changes in the immune status andpolarization of the response towards one parasite can indeed
facilitate the establishment and survival of a second parasitic species
[1–3]. At the level of the individual host, this can be described as animmune system that has to optimize the specificity and effectivenessof the responses against different infections while engaging insecondary but equally important functions, like tissue repair oravoiding immuno-pathology. Systemic cross-regulatory processesand bystander effects by T helper cells (Th) maintain control of thesefunctions both at the systemic and local level [4–8]. Concurrentparasite infections are regulated by and affect these mechanisms[2,4,9–14]. They can also influence each other directly, whensharing the same tissue [15–16] or through the immune system viapassive effects or active manipulation of the immune components, if
colonizing different organs [4,9–14].
Empirical work on bacteria-macroparasite co-infections has
often found that the development of a Th2 mediated responsetowards the helminth leads to a reduction of the protective Th1cytokine response against the bacteria and a more severe bacteria-induced pathology [4,11–14], although a decrease of tissueatrophy has also been observed [17–18]. The suppression ofTh1 cell proliferation acts both on the inductors and effectors andis mainly driven by the repression of the IFN cmediated
inflammatory activity during the early stages of the infection.
However, the degree of the T helper cell polarization and thekinetics of effectors depend on the type, intensity and duration ofthe co-infection, over and above the very initial immune status ofthe host. Since host immunity is both a major selective pressure forparasite transmission and host susceptibility to re-infections, thepresence of one infection can have major consequences for the
PLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 1 January 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e1002345
spread and persistence of the second infection. For example,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces more severe disease when
concurrent with intestinal helminths, suggesting increased host
infectiousness and bacterial transmission compared to single
infected individuals [14].
Understanding how the infection by a second parasite species
can influence the network of immune processes and the
polarization towards one of the infecting agents requires thequantification of the immune components both at the systemic
level and at the local site of infection, and the ability to follow the
kinetics of these processes over time. The immunology of co-infection often considers the Th1/Th2 paradigm a tractable
simplification of the overall immune response and its main
functions. Yet, this approach tells us only half of the story, namelythe systemic component. Indeed, organ compartmentalization and
tissue specificity create well defined host-parasite environments
that contribute to, as well as are modulated by, the immune systemas a whole [19–20]. This brings us to the questions: what are the
key processes and components that capture the essence of immune
mediated parasite interactions in co-infections? And, how do these
differ from single infections?
To address these questions we used a combination of laboratory
experiments and network-based discrete dynamic modelling, and
examined changes in the immune response against single and co-
infection with the respiratory bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica and
the gastrointestinal helminth Trichostrongylus retortaeformis , two
common infections of the European rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ).
Both parasites cause persistent infections that occur with highprevalence and intensity in free-living rabbit populations [21–22].
B. bronchiseptica is a gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the
respiratory tract through oral-nasal transmission and usuallyresults in asymptomatic infections. B. bronchiseptica has been largely
isolated in wildlife, pets and livestock but rarely in humans [23]
where it is out-competed by the human-specific Bordetella pertussis
and Bordetella parapertussis , the etiological agents of whooping cough
[24]. Previous empirical and modelling work in a murine system
showed that the bacterium induces anti-inflammatory responses bymodulating Th regulation, thereby facilitating bacterial establish-
ment and proliferation [8,25]. However, hosts successfullycounteract the pathogen mediated inhibitions by activating a
protective Th1 cell mediated IFN cresponse, which leads to
bacterial clearance from the lower respiratory tract, but not the
nasal cavity, via Fc receptor mediated phagocytosis [25–27]. Ourrecent laboratory studies of rabbits infected with B. bronchiseptica
agree with the general findings of bacterial clearance from the
lower respiratory tract but persistence in the nasal cavity [28].
The gastrointestinal helminth T. retortaeformis has a direct life
cycle and colonizes the small intestine following ingestion of
pasture contaminated with infective third stage larvae (L3). The
majority of larvae settle in the duodenum where they develop intoadults in about 11 days [29]. A model of the seasonal dynamics of
the T. retortaeformis -rabbit interaction suggested that acquired
immunity develops proportionally to the accumulated exposure to
infection and successfully reduces helminth intensity in older hosts
[21,30]. These results were recently confirmed by challenging
laboratory rabbits with a primary infection of T. retortaeformis where
the quick production of antibodies and eosinophils was associatedwith the consistent reduction but not complete clearance of the
helminth by 120 days post challenge [31].
Based on previous studies on bacteria-macroparasite co-
infections and our recent work on the rabbit system, we
hypothesized that during a B. bronchiseptica -T. retortaeformis co-
infection the presence of helminths will delay bacterial clearance
from the respiratory tract but there will be no change in helminth
abundance in the small intestine. We predicted a T. retortaeformis
mediated Th2 polarization at the systemic level and a bystandereffect in the distal respiratory tract. This will have suppressed
IFNc, resulting in the enhancement of bacterial intensity and
deferred clearance in the lower respiratory tract compared to
single infection. We also expected the Th2 systemic environment
to control helminth abundance but not to change the numbers
compared to the single infection. To examine our hypothesis,
laboratory data on single infections were used to build discretedynamic models describing the immune processes generated in
response to each infection. The two single infection models were
then connected through the cross-modulation of Th cells and the
cytokine network at the systemic level, and allowed to reflect
changes in these interactions at the local level. The resulting co-
infection model and the dynamics of the parasites were finally
compared with our laboratory experiment of bacteria-helminthco-infection to confirm the correctness of the model. Lastly, we
examined the robustness of the immune networks with respect to
the deactivation of single immune nodes by simulated knockout
laboratory experiments. In other words, we tested the role of a
large number of immune components, how their knockout affected
the dynamics of infection and how the system converged into a
potentially novel stable state. This allowed us to elucidate the
immune key mechanisms and pathways behind the observed
dynamics and the relative differences between single and
co-infection.
Results
The causal interactions between the immune components
activated by B. bronchiseptica and T. retortaeformis were assembled
in the form of two distinct pathogen-specific networks of immune
responses. The network of interactions against B. bronchiseptica was
based on the infection in the lungs, the crucial organ for bacterial
clearance, and constructed following Thakar et al. [8] and the
current knowledge of the dynamics of B. bronchiseptica infection in
mice ( Fig. 1 ). There is a rich literature on the immunology of
gastrointestinal helminth infections and important general featurescan be identified despite the fact that these mechanisms are oftenAuthor Summary
Infections with different infecting agents can alter the
immune response against any one parasite and the relative
abundance and persistence of the infections within the
host. This is because the immune system is not compart-mentalized but acts as a whole to allow the host tomaintain control of the infections as well as repair
damaged tissues and avoid immuno-pathology. There is
no comprehensive understanding of the immune respons-es during co-infections and of how systemic and localmechanisms interact. Here we integrated experimental
data with mathematical modelling to describe the network
of immune responses of single and co-infection by arespiratory bacterium and a gastrointestinal helminth. We
were able to identify key cells and functions responsible
for clearing or reducing both parasites and showed thatsome mechanisms differed between type of infection as aresult of different signal outputs and cells contributing to
the immune processes. This study highlights the impor-
tance of understanding the immuno-dynamics of co-infection as a host response, how immune mechanismsdiffer from single infections and how they may alter
parasite persistence, impact and abundance.Immuno-network in Single and Co-infections

species-specific. The immune network against T. retortaeformis was
built on the knowledge of helminth infections in mice [6–7] and
focused on the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine),
where the majority of T. retortaeformis colonization and immune
activity was observed ( Fig. 2 ) [29,31]. Both networks were
characterized by two connected compartments: Compartment I
represented the immune interactions at the local site of infection,
the lungs or duodenum, while Compartment II described the
systemic site of T and B cell activation and differentiation, for
example, the lymph node.
The networks were then developed into discrete dynamic
models [32]. Discrete dynamic modelling has been proven to be afeasible and useful approach to qualitatively characterize systems
where the detailed information necessary for quantitative models is
lacking [32–33]. For our purpose to examine the pattern of
immune responses to single and co-infection at the local and
systemic level and, importantly, to highlight key interactions andcells that generated the pattern observed, the framework of the
discrete dynamic Boolean model appeared to be a robust and
tractable choice [34–36], given that the kinetics and timescales of
many of the immune interactions is unknown in the rabbit system.
Each node (e.g. immune cell) was categorized by two qualitative
states, ON and OFF, which are determined from the regulation of
the focal node by upstream nodes given in the network. This
regulation is given by a Boolean transfer function [32,34–35] (see
Materials and Methods, and Supplement Text S1). The nodes in
the ON state are assumed to be above an implicit threshold that
can be defined as the concentration necessary to activate
downstream immune processes; below this threshold the node isin an OFF state. To follow the dynamical status of the system
through time, we repeatedly applied the Boolean transfer functions
for each node until a steady state (i.e. clearance of the pathogen)
was found. To determine the node consensus activity over time
(i.e. the time course of cell concentration or parasite numbers

shared by multiple trajectories) we ran the simulations 100 times
by randomly sampling timescales and plotted each node activity
profile, defined as the proportion of simulations in which the nodeis in the ON state as a function of time (additional details in theMaterials and Methods) [37–38]. This procedure is similar tocharacterizing the consensus behaviour of a population of infected
hosts that exhibit individual-to-individual variation.
To construct the single infection models, we formulated the
Boolean transfer functions from the current knowledge of the
immune regulatory processes and in case of ambiguity we
iteratively modified the transfer function by comparing thesimulated dynamic output with our empirical results on singleinfection and with immune knockout studies (a detailed example isreported in the Materials and Methods). Finally, to examine the
relative importance of the immune components, we perturbed
each node by setting their status to OFF and monitored parasiteactivity up to the time-step required for parasite clearance/reduction in the unperturbed system. Any increase in the infection
activity following the knockout of an immune node -which may
cascade to the connected downstream nodes- indicated theimportance of this node for parasite clearance. Nodes whosedeactivation led to long term persistence, represented by parasiteactivity equal to 1, were classified as essential for clearance. Thisprocedure allowed us to mimic laboratory experiments of single
immune component knockouts and to follow the consequences onparasite clearance.
B. bronchiseptica single infection
The onset of B. bronchiseptica infection in the lungs was simulated
by setting the state of the bacteria node ON and the state of the
nodes of the immune response OFF ( Fig. 3A ). As the infection
proceeded, and consistent with our empirical work [28], IFN cand
IL10 expression rapidly peaked and then slowly decreased below
the threshold through the course of the infection ( Fig. 3B ).B.
bronchiseptica has been suggested to induce IL10 production by T
cell subtypes, which inhibits IFN cin the lower respiratory tract
[25]. By explicitly including the bacteria mediated up-regulation of
IL10, through the type III secretion system (TTSS) modulation of
T regulatory cells (Treg), we were able to capture theestablishment of the bacteria in the lungs followed by their
immune-mediated reduction and clearance. Activation of B cells
by T helper cells led to the prompt increase of peripheralantibodies (serum IgG and IgA), in line with empirical data [26–
27,39]. Serum IgG reached and maintained long-lasting above-
threshold saturation in all simulations whereas IgA activity
dropped along with B. bronchiseptica and was turned off after 15

time-steps (see Materials and Methods) ( Fig. 3C ). The rapid
recruitment of peripheral neutrophils to the lungs was possiblethrough pro-inflammatory cytokine mediated signalling ( Fig. 3D ),
while macrophages were recruited by IFN csecreted by Th1 cells.
The activation of neutrophils and macrophages by antibodies, viathe antibody-antigen complex and complement nodes (see Fig. 1 ),
led to bacterial phagocytosis and clearance from the lungs within20 time steps, in agreement with our empirical work.
The relative importance of the different immune components
was then explored by knocking off single nodes and monitoring thelevel of bacterial intensity at the 20
thtime-step, the time required
forB. bronchiseptica clearance from the lungs in the unperturbed
system. The perturbation results reproduced the observations fromB. bronchiseptica infections in the respective empirical knockoutexperiments ( Fig. 4A ) [8]. For example, it has been observed that
B. bronchiseptica can persist in large numbers in mice where T0,
Th1 or B cells are depleted [8]; the key role of these nodes was
confirmed by our model. The simulations also highlighted the
crucial role of pro-inflammatory responses, dendritic cells,
macrophages and IL12 as their inactive state resulted in bacterial
persistence ( Fig. 4A ). In contrast, knocking out IL4 or any of the
15 remaining nodes of the network did not increase the activity of
the node Bordetella .
T. retortaeformis single infection
The infection of T. retortaeformis was simulated by setting the
state of the infective larvae node ON and the immune nodes OFF
(Fig. 5A ). Ingested larvae were either killed by eosinophils, in a

probabilistic manner [40–41], or successfully developed into
adults. Adults started to appear after 2 time-steps, mimicking thenatural development of infective third stage larvae into adults.
Following the infection, IFN crapidly peaked after two time steps
while IL4 and IL10 activation followed with a delay, in line withempirical findings ( Fig. 5B ) [31]. The initial vigorous expression
of IFN cwas driven by dendritic cells, probably as an inflammatory
response to the infiltration of microflora and bacteria into the
damaged mucosa during the establishment of larvae [31]. This wasmodelled by turning the activity of the local IFN cON if
sufficiently stimulated by dendritic cells; the subsequent IFN c
activation occurred through a Th1 cell response. For the
interpretation of Fig. 5B, the fraction of IFN cactivity that
occurred from 0 to 1 was due to a Th1 response while above 1 wascaused by dendritic cells. Dendritic cells also activated the Th2 cell
mediated expression of IL4 and as this arm of the immune
response developed, IFN cdecreased although remained in an
active state throughout the infection ( Fig. 5B ). IL10 expression
was relatively low and similar to IL4, as found in our experimentalresults. Naı ¨ve T cell-initiated B cell proliferation stimulated the
prompt increase of mucus IgA, IgE and IgG above the activation
threshold ( Fig. 5C ). The consequent recruitment of neutrophils,
along with IgG, led to the reduction but not clearance of adult
helminths, consistent with the empirical observation that a few
individuals still harboured helminths in the duodenum at 120 days
post infection ( Fig. 5A ). Unlike IgA, whose activity followed the
dynamics of T. retortaeformis abundance, IgG activity remained
persistently high. In contrast to the small and short-lived neutrophil
peak, the eosinophil activity was higher and lasted longer ( Fig. 5D ).
The stability of the immune pathways and the reliability of our
parsimonious model were explored by systematically knocking out
network nodes and examining the effects on the activity of the
adult helminth node at the 20
thtime-step, the time point when the
unperturbed system reaches equilibrium ( Fig. 4C ). None of the
perturbations led to an activity of the adult parasite node of less
than 0.3, indicating that T. retortaeformis persists in the rabbit and
this is a robust outcome of the model, which matches our empiricalobservations. Simulations suggested that the individual knockout

of 14 nodes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL13, naı ¨ve T
cells, dendritic cells, eosinophils and neutrophils led to helminthpersistence in all the simulations (i.e. adult activity equal to 1)(Fig. 4C ). Interestingly, deletion of either local or systemic IL4
(IL4I or IL4II) reduced parasite activity, as IL4 contributed to
inhibit neutrophils (via the inhibition of the IL12 node). Toidentify the nodes that may lead to faster reduction or clearance ofT. retortaeformis we constitutively turned ON single nodes. Over-
expression of recruited eosinophils, IL5, neutrophils and Th2 cellsin the small intestine reduced parasite activity below 0.5 (resultsnot shown). These and the knockout simulations suggested thatneutrophils and eosinophils are critically involved in the clearanceofT. retortaeformis infection.B. bronchiseptica-T. retortaeformis co-infection
Network modelling. To explicitly quantify the interactions
between B. bronchiseptica and T. retortaeformis the two single immune
networks were connected and the co-infection network simulated
as a single entity without changing the Boolean rules built for the
single networks, except for the adjustments necessary for assembly(Fig. 6 ). The link between networks was established through the
cytokines, which maintain the communication between the
systemic and local immune processes as well as the cross-interactions between infections. Specifically, we assumed a single
unlimited pool of naive T cells and three pools of cytokines: a pool
in the lungs, a pool in the small intestine (duodenum) and asystemic pool interacting with both infections. For example, we

assumed that only one pool of IL4 and IL12 exists in the systemic
compartment although antigen specific cells, polarized towardsbacteria or helminths, can produce these cytokines. In other words,IL12 induced by bacterial factors can inhibit IL4 production byhelminth-specific Th2 cells. Local cytokine expression can beaffected by mucosal immune components, parasite intensity and thesystemic cytokine response. These assumptions allowed us to takeinto account the compartmentalization of the infections (i.e. lungsand duodenum) as well as bystander effects of the immune responseand the balance of the immune system as a whole. The dynamics ofthe simulated immune components and associated parasite activitywere then compared with the empirical co-infection results.
B. bronchiseptica .Simulations showed the switch of
cytokines from the initial high expression of IFN cand IL10 to
the late increase and long activity of IL4 ( Fig. 7B ). Antibodies
quickly increased, serum IgG remained consistently high while IgAdecreased below the threshold after 5 time-steps as bacterialnumbers declined ( Fig. 7C ). The peripheral neutrophil activity
was higher in co-infected compared to single infected hosts,however, their recruitment in the lungs was completely turned offafter 14 time steps ( Fig. 7D vsFig. 5D ). These temporal patterns
resulted from the inflammatory cytokines produced in response toboth T. retortaeformis and B. bronchiseptica and should be interpreted
as a mixed activity against both parasites. Our simulationsindicated similarities between B. bronchiseptica single and co-
infection, such as the rapid increase in systemic IgA, IgG andneutrophils but also differences, namely, the higher and longeractivity of IL4 in the lungs and the longer presence of peripheralneutrophils in dual compared to single infection. Overall, despite afew immunological differences the dynamics and timing of B.
bronchiseptica clearance in the lungs of co-infected hosts was similar
to that observed in the single infection and driven by phagocyticcells activated by antibodies and Th1 cells ( Fig. 7A ). The low but
non-zero activity of bacteria in the co-infection steady state
indicated that the infection was not cleared in a small fraction ofthe replicate simulations (8%) ( Fig. 7A ). Specifically, IL4 activatedby eosinophils in response to T. retortaeformis was responsible for the
persistence of bacteria in the lungs. During single bacterialinfection the IL4 level was relatively low and controlled by theinhibitory effect of IL12, however, during the co-infection thissuppressive effect was not observed as a Th2 environmentdominated. This model prediction is supported by previousstudies that showed a delayed bacterial clearance in case ofpersistent IL4 [42]. Knockout perturbation analysis confirmed thatIL4 produced by eosinophils was responsible for this occasionalbacterial persistence, since the deletion of this node led to thecomplete clearance of the infection in all the simulations ( Fig. 4B ).
Bacterial persistence was also observed when Th1 cells, antibodies,pro-inflammatory cytokines or the activated phagocytes node wereindividually knocked out. The 15 nodes whose deletion had verylittle effect in the single infection had a similarly weak effect onbacterial numbers in the co-infection ( Fig. 4A vs4B). Interestingly
and contrary to the single infection, the knockout of bacteria-activated epithelial cells did not influence B. bronchiseptica activity
since the pro-inflammatory cytokines node, which is downstreamof the epithelial cells node, was also activated by the helminths.This between-organ communication was possible by assuming a
single pool of cytokines and their free movement among organs,
for example via the blood system. Perturbation of any of the 17helminth-specific nodes had a generally weak effect on bacterialactivity.
T. retortaeformis .The concurrent effect of B. bronchiseptica
on T. retortaeformis infection dynamics was equally examined.
Counter to our initial predictions, lower establishment and fasterclearance of T. retortaeformis were observed in co-infected compared
to single infected hosts ( Fig. 8A vs5A). The model showed high
activities of IFN cand IL10 and low expression of IL4 ( Fig. 8B ).
As observed in the single infection, the early peak of IFN c(having
activity .1) was caused by an initial host-mediated inflammatory
response, as an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction of the
tissue to the establishment of infective larvae. This local activationwas then followed by a Th1 mediated IFN cexpression, consistent

with the single infection model. A bystander Th1 mediated effect
ofB. bronchiseptica synergistically contributed to this pattern by
enhancing the activity and duration of IFN cexpression in the
duodenum. Simulations suggested that the local IL10 expression,higher in the dual compared to the single infection, was abystander effect induced by the type three secretion system (TTSS)
ofB. bronchiseptica through Treg cells. Also, the early IL4 expression
was suppressed by the Th1 mediated IFN cphenotype activated
both by the helminth, during the initial establishment, and thebacterial co-infection. Mucus IgG remained consistently activefrom time step 3 while mucus IgA was at the highest between 5and 10 time steps but decreased thereafter ( Fig. 8C ). Recruited
peripheral neutrophils but not eosinophils were higher in the dualinfection compared to single helminth infection simulations(Fig. 8D ).To provide a parsimonious mechanism that could explain the
rapid helminth clearance, the immune nodes of the co-infectionnetwork were systematically knocked out and the helminth activityexamined at the 20
thtime-step ( Fig. 4D ). Similar to the single
infection, the deactivation of key nodes, for instance B cells,dendritic cells or T cells, resulted in helminth persistence in all the
simulations (adult activity equal to 1). Unlike in the single
infection, knockout of resident eosinophils or the IL12II nodedid not lead to helminth persistence. This was because theinduction of downstream processes, such as the activation of IL4or IFN cwas now performed through the complementary effect of
the bacterial nodes and their bystander effects. Interestingly, thesingle knockout of 92% of the nodes, including bacterium-specificnodes, increased helminth activity, compared to the unperturbedco-infection model, but did not lead to helminth persistence in

every simulation. From a modelling perspective, the network in
Fig. 6 represents a sparse causal model of co-infection dynamics.
In other words, all these nodes or nodes downstream of thetargeted nodes contribute to, but are not required for, T.
retortaeformis clearance. The knockout of effector nodes namely,
recruited eosinophils or neutrophils and cytokines like IL5 or IL13,
resulted in helminth long term persistence, supporting the
hypothesis that a co-operative mechanism including leukocytes,antigen-specific antibodies (IgG and IgE) and Th2 mediated IL5
and IL13 are critical in helminth clearance [43–49]. The role of
IL5 and IL13 is mostly in the recruitment of eosinophils while
neutrophils are recruited by pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th1mediated IFN c. Though antibodies recognize the helminth, in this
model they do not form complexes, rather, they attract leukocytesbearing Fc-receptors leading to the recruitment of neutrophils andeosinophils.
A comparison between single and dual infection offers insights
into the contribution and balance of these two leukocytes to T.
retortaeformis dynamics. In the single infection, when neutrophils are
only transiently activated, the recruited eosinophils were relativelymore important to parasite reduction, although they were notsufficient to clear the infection. In the co-infection, the robust andearly activation of recruited neutrophils -which decreasedfollowing helminth reduction- and the activation of recruited

eosinophils -which are important in reducing the number of
infecting larvae and are required for neutrophils to successfullyreduce the helminths- highlighted the synergistic role of these cellsin the observed fast clearance of T. retortaeformis . To explicitly study
the bacterial components inducing these two leukocytes, we
switched the nodes to ON one at a time and found that dendriticcells and Th1 cells, activated by bacteria, led to a significantincrease in neutrophil activity (results not shown). Counter to this,
no bacterial nodes significantly contributed to eosinophil produc-
tion. Switching ON the type III secretion system node transientlyincreased eosinophil activity, compared to the unperturbedsystem, as expected from the role of TTSS in the induction ofTh2 related cytokines [25]. However, this had a very short lived
effect since TTSS was neutralized by antibodies. In summary,
simulations suggest that strong inflammatory responses generatedby the bacteria led to an early increase of neutrophils whichcontributed to a prompt and more effective helminth reduction.
Empirical co-infection experiment
AB. bronchiseptica-T. retortaeformis co-infection experiment was
carried out and the empirical results were used to validate the co-
infection dynamic model. A statistical analysis was also performedbetween the single and co-infection trials to further reinforce ourmodelling outputs. However, while the statistical findings providean insight into the relationships among the immune components,
no mechanistic understanding or dynamic outcomes can be
established between these variables and parasite abundance. Thenetwork-based discrete dynamic models allowed us to establishsuch connections and causal interactions between the various
components. Overall, we found that the parsimonious dynamic
model correctly predicted the observed dynamics of concurrent B.
bronchiseptica and T. retortaeformis co-infection.
B. bronchiseptica .The bacterial colonization of the
respiratory tract of co-infected rabbits was similar to single
infection. B. bronchiseptica abundance in the lungs increased in the
first 7 days post challenge and decreased thereafter, as seen in thedynamic model; by 90 days bacteria were completely cleared from
the lungs and trachea but persisted in the nasal cavity ( Fig. 9A ).
Based on the a priori measurement of optical density with a
spectrophotometer, individuals received a dose similar to the singleinfection however, the a posteriori quantification of bacteria on
blood agar plates suggested that an inoculum of 10,600 CFU/ml
was administered, five times less than the single infection dose
[28]. If we consider the second measure correct, the lower dose didnot affect replication and the colony numbers quickly reachedvalues comparable to single infection by 3–7 days post challenge.
Specifically, the average number of bacteria in the lower res-
piratory tract was analogous to the single infection but significantlyhigher numbers were observed in the nasal cavity during theinfection ( Fig. 9A, Table 1 ). Confirming the model simulations,
IFNcquickly increased, peaked by 3 days post challenge and
quickly decreased thereafter. IL10 followed a similar pattern witha small delay while IL4 slowly increased and peaked 60 days postinfection ( Fig. 9B ). Serum antibodies showed a trend similar to
that of the single infection, in accordance with our dynamic model.
IgG rapidly increased and remained high throughout the
experiment while IgA rapidly decreased although a second peakwas observed around week twelve, this second peak was based onmuch fewer individuals and, probably, it was not biologically
relevant ( Fig. 9C ). Peripheral leukocytes concentration reflected
the response to both infections specifically, neutrophil numbersshowed a robust peak at week three while eosinophil numbersincreased between two and five weeks post-infection, both in
agreement with the model ( Fig. 9D andFig. 10D ).A combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and
generalized linear models (GLM) indicated that B. bronchiseptica in
the lungs was negatively associated with IL4, serum IgG and IgA(PCA axis 1), and peripheral eosinophils and neutrophils (PCA 2,
Table S1 ). To compare the immune response between single and
co-infected hosts, variables were scaled over the controls. Co-
infected rabbits exhibited higher IL4 (coeff 6S.E. =20.87960.210,
P,0.001), serum IgG (0.166 60.043 P ,0.001) and neutrophils
(0.23360.050, P ,0.0001) but lower eosinophils ( 21.70560.006,
P,0.0001) compared to single infected individuals. It is important
to note that a low or negative cytokine Ct value (cycle threshold
scaled over the controls) identifies high mRNA expression and vice
versa, thus in the models low Ct values are translated as highcytokine activity. The remaining variables were not significant,
although this should not be interpreted as a complete lack of
variability between the two infections. Indeed, as highlighted in the
network model these variables play a secondary but still necessary
role in generating immune differences between infections.
T. retortaeformis .Helminth intensity significantly decreased
with the progression of the infection and organ location (high
numbers in the duodenum, SI1, and low in the ileum, SI4)
however, counter to our expectation and consistent with ourmodel simulations, lower establishment and faster clearance were
observed in co-infected compared to single infected hosts
(Fig. 10A, Table 2 ). As predicted by our dynamic model,
strong and persistent IFN cexpression but relatively low IL4 and
IL10 were found in the duodenum of infected rabbits compared tothe controls ( Fig. 10B ). Consistent with the single infection and
the dynamic model, mucus antibody quickly increased, IgG
remained relatively high for the duration of the trial while IgAdeclined from day 30 post challenge ( Fig. 10C ). The peripheral
leukocyte profile has already been described in the bacteria section
(Fig. 9D andFig. 10D ). Principal component analysis identified
that T. retortaeformis was positively associated with the first axis
(PCA 1), mainly described by the interaction among the threecytokines, and negatively related to the second axis (PCA 2)
represented by eosinophils and antibodies ( Table S2 ).
Interestingly, cytokines were positively correlated (IFN cvs IL10:
r = 58% P ,0.001; IL4 vs IL10: r = 54%, P ,0.01), indicating the
co-occurrence of a specific response to the helminth, through IL4,but also a robust inflammatory/anti-inflammatory reaction
probably caused by the parasite damaging the mucosal
epithelium and resulting in bacterial tissue infiltration during
larval establishment [31]. The comparison of immune variables
between single and co-infection showed higher neutrophils(P,0.0001) and a tendency for higher IL10 (P = 0.058) in co-
infected compared to single infected hosts. The overall expression
of IL4 was lower in co-infected individuals (P = 0.035), however
higher values were observed at 14 days post infection (interaction
of IL4 with day 14 post infection P = 0.046).
Discussion
Co-infections affect the immune responses but how the systemic
processes interact and influence the kinetics at the local sites ofinfection is still unclear. The majority of studies on the
immunology of co-infection have focused on either one of the
infecting species or a restricted class of cells or immune processes,
and often concentrated on the early stage of the infection [4,9–
14,50–52]. These studies have been extremely useful in highlight-ing not only the similarities across systems but also the specificity of
some of these mechanisms and how they differ from single
infections. Yet, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding
of these processes as a whole individual response, how systemicImmuno-network in Single and Co-infections

and localized processes interact and how they dynamically evolve
during the course of the co-infection. We used a combination of
laboratory experiments and modelling to examine the dynamic
network of immune responses to the respiratory bacterium B.
bronchiseptica and the gastrointestinal helminth T. retortaeformis . Our
aim was to identify the parsimonious processes and key cells
driving parasite reduction or clearance and how they changed
between single and co-infections.
We confirmed the initial hypothesis of immune mediated
interactions between the two parasites, however, our initial
predictions were only partially supported. The most unexpected
result was the faster clearance of T. retortaeformis in co-infected
compared to single infected individuals, which was observed in themodel simulations and confirmed in the empirical data. Neither
did we expect to find that B. bronchiseptica infection in the lungs was
not significantly altered by the concurrent helminth infection,despite the increase in local IL4 expression observed in both thesimulations and the experiment. We found a small difference inbacterial clearance between single and co-infection ( Fig. 3A vs
Fig. 7A ) and we were able to explain that this was driven by the
differential recruitment of phagocytes, particularly macrophagesinduced by IFN cduring co-infections, as compared to the single
infection. However we found that T. retortaeformis enhanced
individual variability in the immune response to B. bronchiseptica
infection by occasionally reducing the overall efficacy of the Th1immune response, through eosinophil produced IL4, and

preventing bacterial clearance in the lungs, a pattern observed in
8% of the simulations. The helminth mediated delay or absence of
bacterial clearance from the lower respiratory tract was indeed our
original hypothesis and interestingly the model indicated that this
is still a possible outcome of the interaction between these
parasites. This implies that heterogeneities in the host immune
response are not exceptional events and can have major effects on
the dynamics of infection and persistence. Our model was able to
capture this variability because of the large number of simulations;
in other words a large group of infected individuals were examined
compared to our much smaller sample tested in the laboratory.
Follow-up experiments using a much larger number of animals or
replication of the same experiment a few times may lead to the
experimental observation of this behaviour. The empirical findings
also showed that T. retortaeformis infection resulted in a significant
increase of bacterial numbers in the nasal cavity compared to
single infection, particularly after the initial phase of the infection.
At the host population level these findings support the hypothesis
that co-infections can increase individual variability to infections
by altering bacterial intensity and prevalence, and this can have
major consequences for the risk of transmission and disease
outbreak [53]. Overall, our dynamic models indicated that the
clearance of B. bronchiseptica in single and co-infection was mainly
driven by phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages and neutro-
phils activated by antibodies. Deactivating nodes that affected
bacterial recognition (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines, epithelial
cells or antibodies) or phagocytosis (e.g. Ag-Ab complex or
macrophages) increased bacterial abundance in single and dual
infections, suggesting that these cells are necessary for controlling
B. bronchiseptica .
The immune network for T. retortaeformis was less detailed than
that for the bacterial network, nevertheless, the model predictions
of the activity pattern of the helminth and the immune variables
that have been quantified were in agreement with our empirical
studies. To our surprise the prediction of no effect of B.
bronchiseptica on T. retortaeformis infection was proven wrong.Simulations suggested that the combined effect of neutrophils,
eosinophils and antibodies (IgG and IgE) led to helminth
expulsion. Neutrophils and eosinophils were activated throughantigen-specific Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively. Th2-mediated differentiation of progenitor eosinophils (i.e. resident
eosinophils), modulated by IL5 and IL13, also played an
important role in helminth reduction in single infection, asindicated by the perturbation results. Previous studies on murine
systems have shown that IL13 can complement IL4 or play an
alternative or even stronger role in helminth infections [42–43].Using our modelling approach we showed that IL5 and IL13 hadcomplementary abilities against helminths and contributed to
parasite reduction both in single and co-infection. The strategic
role of neutrophils in bacteria-helminth co-infections has beenpreviously described [44]; using a modelling approach not only weconfirmed this property but also suggested a non-specific
infiltration of effector cells into infected tissues.
The mixed Th1/Th2 response in the duodenum was driven by
different processes. The early IFN cinflammatory signal observed
both in single and co-infection was a host response to the mucosa
damage by helminth establishment, and probably bacteria andmicroflora infiltration from the lumen [31]. This was also
complemented by a bystander effect of B. bronchiseptica co-infection,
rather than a helminth induced up-regulation of this cytokine tofacilitate tissue colonization [31]. This mechanism is supported byour recent studies on cytokine expression in different organs of
single and co-infected rabbits at seven days post infection, where
we showed that IFN cwas remarkably reduced in the ileum,
mesenteric lymph node and spleen, where fewer or no helminthswere found, compared to the duodenum [54]. The Th2 cell
activity was primarily focused on preventing parasite establishment
and survival. These findings indicate that these two cytokines arenot mutually exclusive but can simultaneously act on different
tasks specifically, tissue repair, inflammatory response to micro-
flora infiltration and helminth clearance. Mixed Th1/Th2phenotypes are not new to parasite infections and the murine-Schistosoma mansoni orTrichuris muris systems are well described
examples [55–57].
Model strengths and limitations
The aim of this study was to develop tractable dynamic models
that could capture the interactions of multi-organ, multi-speciesco-infection immune processes as well as single infection dynamics.We found the discrete dynamic Boolean models a feasible and
reliable approach for this task since we lacked accurate spatio-
temporal details on the majority of the variables and the kineticparameters required to develop robust quantitative, differentialequation-based models [34–36]. Boolean models assume that what
matters the most is whether the concentration or level of
expression of a node (i.e. immune cell) is higher or lower thanan a priori fixed threshold. They also use a parameter-free
combinatorial description for the change in status of the nodes,
thus avoid the need for parameter estimation while beingsufficiently flexible. Indeed, Boolean models have been successfullyused in a variety of contexts, from signal transduction [38,58] to
development [59–60], immune responses [8,61–62] and popula-
tion-level networks [63]. Choosing a quantitative modellingapproach would have forced us to drastically simplify our system,
impose a large number of assumptions on the concentration,
transfer function and kinetic parameter of each node, and so wewould have not been able to offer robust predictions on the role ofmany immune components and on how they affect the dynamics
of parasite infection in our system.Table 1. Summary of linear mixed effect model (LME)

Our models were based on the most updated knowledge of the
immune components and processes during single infections toBordetella and gastrointestinal helminths. In cases of uncertainty
(e.g. whether two co-regulators were independent or synergistic)we tested a number of different assumptions (i.e. Boolean transferfunctions) and selected the function that best described our singleinfection experiments in terms of the: timing of events, nodeactivities and importantly, parasite steady state (see Materials andMethods for an example). To overcome the fact that timescales
and duration of immune processes were unknown, we generated
repeated simulations with various update orders, which essentiallyallowed us the sampling of various time durations and probing
which model output was robust to timing uncertainties. Impor-tantly, the outputs of our simulations were not averages but thequantification of the agreement between runs, for example, theanti- B. bronchiseptica IgG activity of 1 after step 4 in Fig. 3C means
that following this time point all runs show an above-thresholdconcentration of IgG regardless of timing variations. By compar-ing the features of the curves (e.g. saturating shape, peakoccurrence and timing) with our experimental observations we
were able to confirm the accuracy of the model in predicting the
observed kinetics.

One of the strengths of our modelling was to make predictions
on the dynamics of parasite clearance based on the perturbation ofthe nodes (i.e. single node knockout). These simulations followedthe classical knockout lab experiments where single immunecomponents (nodes) were turned off from the beginning of thesimulation and the dynamics of the immune response, as well asparasite clearance, were examined. This approach allowed us toexplore the knockout of a large number of immune variables,determine the most important components modulating theimmune response and highlight how they differed between singleand co-infection. These findings can be tested in the laboratory byperforming knockout experiments of the crucial immune variablesin different infection settings. For example, we can blockneutrophil production or the cytokine IL13 and examine whetherhelminths persist -as predicted by our knockout simulations- or areslowly cleared in bacteria co-infected rabbits. Similarly, we can testthe predicted different response of knocking out IL4 in helminthand bacteria-helminth co-infection, specifically, whether clearanceis higher than in un-manipulated individuals in single helminthinfection and lower than in un-manipulated co-infected hosts. Weshould also pay more attention to B. bronchiseptica infection in the
nasal cavity and develop dynamic immune models that canexplain bacterial persistence as well as possible clearance underdifferent knockout scenarios both in single and co-infection. Themost parsimonious hypotheses can then be tested in thelaboratory. This is important because our recent work suggestedthat bacterial shedding during the long lasting chronic phase reliesmainly on the infection of the upper respiratory tract, once it hasbeen cleared from the lungs and trachea [28]. This has relevant
epidemiological implications for bacterial transmission that go
beyond the rabbit-parasite system. We can further refine ourmodels and explore the dynamics of the parasite-immune network
when the onset of the co-infections is lagged between the parasitespecies or one parasite is trickle dosed, a dynamic that resemblesmore closely to the natural conditions. Again, these predictionscan be validated through experimental infections of naı ¨ve or
knockout animals. It is important to underline that our approachcan be adapted to a large variety of bacteria-helminth co-infections of many host systems where organ compartmentaliza-tion, differences in the time of infection or number of parasitestages are observed.
In conclusion, we showed that network-based discrete dynamic
models are a useful approach to describe the immune mediateddynamics of co-infections. These models are robust as well assufficiently tractable to qualitatively capture the complexity of theimmune system and its kinetics over time. Arguably, the mainlimitation of our modelling approach is that it lacks a fullyquantitative component. Yet, this work demonstrated that it ispossible to build comprehensive qualitative dynamic models of thelocal and systemic immune network of single and co-infection thatare validated by empirical observations. Importantly, this study is afundamental starting point towards the future construction ofquantitative models based on simplified networks that describe thekinetics and intensities of the causal relationships among keyimmune components identified in qualitative models. Ourapproach showed that we can refine the conventional approachof using the Th1/Th2 paradigm, by identifying system-specificfunctions or cell groups that can capture crucial immune processes
during co-infections. While our parsimonious dynamical models
were able to capture the patterns of single and co-infectionobserved in the experiments, we are aware that they are far fromcomplete in describing the immunological complexity of theprocesses involved and cells activated. Nevertheless, they provide aparsimonious description of the system that can be experimentallytested. Ultimately, we showed that we cannot predict how theimmune system reacts to co-infections based on our knowledge ofsingle infection. More needs to be done to clarify the immunemechanisms involved in bacteria-helminth co-infections and howindividual hosts balance the immune system as a whole.
Materials and Methods
Network modelling
Network assembly. Interaction networks were built from
the available literature and adapted to our system. Bacteria,helminth and the components of the immune system (i.e. immunecells and cytokines) were represented as network nodes;interactions, regulatory relationships and transformations amongcomponents were described as directed edges starting from thesource node (regulator) and ending in the target node. Weincorporated regulatory relationships that modulate a process (oran unspecified process mediator) as edges directed toward another
edge. The regulatory effect of each edge was classified into
activation or inhibition, visually represented by an incoming blackarrow or an incoming red blunt segment. Since not all processesinvolved in natural B. bronchiseptica and T. retortaeformis infections
are known or generally addressed in the rabbit infection model, weextended the set of known interactions following generalimmunological knowledge on bacterial and helminth infections.We constructed three networks: two networks that describe therespective single infections and one that links the first two andrepresents a co-infection network. A detailed description of eachnetwork is given below.

interactions ( Fig. 1, Text S1 ). This node includes generic
virulence factors of the bacteria such as the lipopolysaccharide
chain (LPS) required for tissue adherence following recognition of
bacteria by epithelial cells. Other bacterial virulence factors,particularly O-antigen and type III secretion system (TTSS), areexplicitly included as separate nodes in the network and areinvolved in the initial immune recognition of the bacteria node.Upon detection, epithelial cells activate pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines, which in turn activate dendritic cells, often the most
important antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells are alsoactivated by IFN c. Dendritic cells induce differentiation of naı ¨ve
T cells (T0) by producing IL4 and IL12. The cytokine profilealong with the antigen leads to the activation of T cell subtypesincluding helper and regulatory T cells. T helper cells are activatedin the lymph nodes (Compartment II) and subsequently tran-
sported to the site of infection (Compartment I). IL4 is also
produced by differentiated Th2 cells; IL4 and IL12 inhibit eachother and IL4 also inhibits IFN c. T regulatory (Treg) cells are
stimulated by the type III secretion system of B. bronchiseptica to
produce IL10. Th1 cells produce IFN cwhich along with pro-
inflammatory cytokines activates neutrophils and macrophages. A
different subtype of T cells, follicular T helper cells, is known to
stimulate B cell activation. To simplify the network we assumedthat naı ¨ve T cells could play this role. Antigen-specific B cell
proliferation leads to the production of antibodies, namely IgGand IgA. IgA production occurs only in the direct presence ofantigen unlike IgG that persists after bacterial clearance [28]. IgGand bacteria complexes also induce complement fixation along
with bacteria themselves. Activation of complement by bacteria is
inhibited by O-antigen. The node ‘‘activated phagocytic cells’’represents the outcome of the stimulation of neutrophils andmacrophages by antibody-antigen complex and complement.These cells induce the node phagocytosis that depletes bacteria.
T. retortaeformis single infection. The network starts with
infective larvae that develop into adults with no delay in the larval-adult development, adults appear 2 time steps post infection(Fig. 2, Text S1 ). Both parasite stages activate epithelial cells that
lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which then
activate dendritic cells and neutrophils, with the latter able toinhibit adult helminths. Infective larvae stimulate IL13 productionby resident eosinophils and these recruit additional eosinophilsfrom the progenitor cells in the peripheral blood [63]. Eosinophilscan kill larvae through a stochastic process described by a uniform
distribution [64]. IL5 secreted by Th2 cells is required for the
recruitment of additional eosinophils. Infective larvae also directlyactivate IFN cby damaging the mucosa tissue and causing a host
inflammatory response. This process does not include Th1 cells.Pro-inflammatory cytokines activate dendritic cells that stimulatenaı¨ve T cells (T0). As described for B. bronchiseptica , dendritic cells
interact with naı ¨ve T cells (T0) leading to the activation of T cell
subtypes Th1 and Th2 through the production of IL12 and IL4.
IL4 is also produced by Th2 cells and IL4 and IL12 inhibit eachother. Consistent with the bacteria network, the activation of Thelper cells occurs in the lymph nodes (Compartment II) andsubsequently transported to the site of infection (Compartment I).In compartment I, IFN cis produced by Th1 cells and dendritic
cells. IL4 and IL10, produced by Th2 cells, have anti-
inflammatory properties and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokinesand neutrophils. Naive T cells stimulate clonal expansion of B cellsand these lead to the production of antibodies such as IgG. WhileB cells can secrete IgG much longer after antigen removal, IgAproduction is assumed to be in response to larval establishmentand development. The IgE isotype is produced upon signalling
from either IL4 or IL13. Among these antibodies IgG inhibits adulthelminths while IgE and IgA are involved in activating eosinophils
and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines respectively.
B. bronchiseptica-T. retortaeformis co-infection. The co-
infection immune network was developed by combining the two
single infection networks together ( Fig. 6, Text S1 ). This network
is characterized by three compartments, representing the lungs,the small intestine (duodenum) and the systemic compartment (e.g.the lymphatic system). The connection of the networks and theimmune mediated interactions between parasites were representedthrough the cytokines produced as a single pool. Local cellsactivated by bacteria and helminths can contribute to cytokine
production, which are then transported through the blood and
disseminate to other organs [63]. For example, pro-inflammatorycytokines are systematically detectable when any one of theparasites activates epithelial cells. Similarly, IL4 or IL12 can beproduced by B. bronchiseptica -o r T. retortaeformis -specific T subtypes
or dendritic cells. For the co-infection network, Tregs are induced
by bacteria which produce IL10 that can ultimately affect the
helminth, since IL10 is not an antigen-specific node. Moreover,there is only a single pool of naı ¨ve T cells that induces T cell
subtypes against either the bacteria or the helminths, dependingon the antigen-specific dendritic cells.
Discrete dynamic model implementation. The immune-
parasite interaction networks were developed into discretedynamical models by characterizing each node with a variablethat can take the ON state, when the concentration or activity is
above the threshold level necessary to activate downstream
immune processes, or the OFF state when activity is below thisthreshold. The evolution of the state of each node was describedby a Boolean transfer function ( Text S1 ) [32]. Target nodes with a
single activator and no inhibitors follow the state of the activatorwith a delay. The operator AND was used to describe a synergistic
or conditional interaction between two or more nodes that is
necessary to activate the target node. When either of the nodeswere sufficient for the activation of the target node we used theoperator OR. An inhibitory effect was represented by an ANDNOT operator. In cases where prior biological information did notcompletely determine the transfer functions (e.g. there was no
information whether two coincident regulatory effects are
independent or synergistic), different alternative transferfunctions were tested. The transfer functions that reproduced thequalitative features of the single infection experimental timecourses, such as the parasite clearance profile, the relative peaks ofdifferent cytokines or the saturating behaviour of IgG as comparedto IgA, were selected. For example, IL4 is produced by T helper
cells during T helper cell differentiation as well as by eosinophils in
response to stimulation by nematode antigens or allergens. WhileIL12 is known to inhibit the production of IL4, there are twopossible ways this cytokine may interact with IL4: IL12 can inhibitIL4 produced by T helper cells or IL12 can suppress IL4production by blocking both the T helper and eosinophil signal.
The inhibitory effect of IL4 on the activation of neutrophils is
known. The two transfer functions were then examined bycomparing the temporal pattern for neutrophils and IL4 from thesingle T. retortaeformis infection model with the experimental
observations. The second transfer function did not reproducethe observed low activity of IL4 -compared to the other cytokines-
in the duodenum at day 14 post infection and it also led to higher
neutrophil activity, compared to the other leukocytes, than theempirical data. Since the first transfer function did not lead to suchdeficiencies, we chose the first over the second rule. The transferfunctions used in the co-infection model were the same as, or therelevant composites of, transfer functions used in each individual
infection. Thus, the Boolean transfer functions applied in ourImmuno-network in Single and Co-infections

model provide a mechanistic understanding of the interactions
leading to bacterial or helminth clearance.
The status of the system across time was simulated by repeatedly
applying the Boolean rules for each node until a stationary state(e.g. clearance of the parasite) was found. Since the kinetics andtimescales of the individual processes represented as edges are notknown, a random order asynchronous update was selectedwherein the timescales of each regulatory process were randomlychosen in such a way that the node states were updated in arandomly selected order during each time-step [32]. Theasynchronous algorithm was: X
t
i~Fi(Xtaa,Xtb
b,Xtcc,:::), where Fis
the Boolean transfer function, ta,tb,tcrepresent the time points
corresponding to the last change in the state of the input nodes a,
b, cand can be in the previous or current time-step. The time-step
(time unit) of our model approximately corresponds to nine days.The randomized asynchronicity of the model does not alter thesteady states of the dynamical system but causes stochasticity in thetrajectory between the initial conditions and the equilibria(attractors) [32,37], thus it can sample more diverse behavioursas the traditionally used synchronous models. To determine thenode consensus activity over time (i.e. shared by trajectories withdifferent update orders) we ran the simulations 100 times andpresented the fraction of simulations in which the node was in anON state at a given time-step in the node activity profile. Weconfirmed that running the simulations for more than 100 timesdid not change the activity profiles.
Our approach of using discrete dynamic modelling allowed us
to sample the timescales of interactions and perform replicatesimulations as well as provide continuously varying activities of thenetwork nodes over time, which ranged between the lower limit of0 (below-threshold concentration in all runs) and upper limit of 1(above-threshold concentration in all runs). However, notice theexception for IFN cexpression higher than one in the helminth
infections. While these activities cannot be directly compared toquantitative concentrations, we could compare the qualitativefeatures of the time courses and ask: are they saturating? Do theyshow single or multiple peaks? We could also compare the relativetrends of similar variables. It is important to stress that theempirical data on B. bronchiseptica-T. retortaeformis co-infection were
not used as inputs to the co-infection model but only to validatethe simulated course and intensity of immune responses during co-infection.
Laboratory experiments
The primary single infections of naı ¨ve rabbits with B.
bronchiseptica strain RB50 and T. retortaeformis have been described
in detail in Pathak et al. [28] and Murphy et al. [31]. The co-infection of naı ¨ve rabbits with a primary dose of B. bronchiseptica
RB50 and T. retortaeformis followed similar procedures. Here, we
report a concise description of the experimental design, quanti-fication of the immune variables and parasite intensities.
Ethics statement. All listed animal procedures were pre-
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ofThe Pennsylvania State University.
Co-infection study design. Out-bred 60 days old New
Zealand White male rabbits were intra-nasally inoculated with1 ml of PBS solution containing 2.5 610
4B. bronchiseptica RB50
and simultaneously orally challenged with a 5 ml mineral watersolution of 5,500 infective third stage T. retortaeformis larvae (L3).
Control individuals were treated with 1 ml of PBS or 5 ml ofwater, respectively. Groups of 6 individuals (4 infected and 2
controls) were euthanized at days 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120 post
challenge and both the respiratory tract and small intestine wereremoved to quantify: parasite abundance, cytokine expression inthe lungs and small intestine (duodenum) and mucus-specific anti-
helminth antibody levels (IgA and IgG) from the duodenum to the
ileum (Section SI-1 to SI-4). Blood samples were collected weeklyand used for serum-specific antibody quantification against both
parasites and leukocyte cells count [28,31].
Parasite quantification. A fixed amount of lungs (15 ml),
trachea (5 ml) and nasal cavity (15 ml), homogenized in PBS, wasserial diluted onto BG blood agar plates supplemented with
streptomycin and incubated at 37 uC for 48 hours for bacteria
quantification (Colony forming units, CFU) [28]. The four sectionsof the small intestine (SI-1 to SI-4) were washed over a sieve
(100
mm) and helminths collected and stored in 50 ml tubes.
Parasites were counted in five 2.5 ml aliquots and the meannumber, developmental stage and sex (only for adults) estimated in
the four sections [31].
Local cytokine gene expression. The expression of IFN c,
IL-4 and IL-10 in the lung and duodenum was determined usingTaqman qRT- PCR. RNA isolation, reverse transcription and
qRT-PCR quantification were performed following protocols we
have developed [28,31].
Antibody detection: Antibody IgA and IgG against B. bronchiseptica
and adult T. retortaeformis were quantified using Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbance Assay (ELISA) [28,31]. Optimal dilutions and
detector antibody against the two parasites were selected by
visually identifying the inflection point from the resulting dilutioncurves. For B. bronchiseptica serum dilutions were: 1:10 for IgA and
1:10,000 for IgG, secondary detection antibody: IgA 1:5,000 and
IgG 1:10,000. For T. retortaeformis mucus dilution was: 1:10 both
for IgA and IgG and 1:5,000 for the secondary antibody. We
found cross-reactivity at the antibody level between the somatic
third stage infective larvae (L3) and the adults both in the serum
and the mucus [31]. As such and for simplicity, the empirical data
and the network models were based on the antibody response tothe adult helminth stage.
Haematology. Blood in anti-coagulated EDTA tubes was
processed using the Hemavet 3 haematology system (Drew
Scientific, USA) and the general haematological profile
quantified [28].
Statistical analysis. Linear mixed effect models (LME-
REML) were applied to identify changes in the immune
variables during the course of the co-infection and between
single and co-infection. The individual identification code (ID) wasincluded as a random effect and an autoregressive function of
order 1 (AR-1) was integrated to take into account the non-
independent sampling of the same individual through time or themonitoring of different parts of the same organ from the same
individual. To identify the combination of immunological
variables that mainly affected parasite abundance a principal
component analysis (PCA singular value decomposition) was used
[31]. Briefly, the strongest linear combination of variables alongthe two main PC axes was identified; generalized linear models
(GLM) were then used to examine how parasite abundance was
influenced by each PC axis. To compare the immune variablesbetween single and co-infection, data from infected animals were
initially scaled over the controls as: Xij* = Xij-Xc , where Xijis an
immune variable for individual iat time jand Xcis the total
average of the controls across the infection for that variable.

Abstract
A significant fraction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae  genome is transcribed periodically during the
cell division cycle 1,2, suggesting that properly timed gene expression is important for regulating cell
cycle events. Genomic analyses of transcription factor localization and expression dynamics suggest
that a network of sequentially expressed transcription factors could control the temporal program of
transcription during the cell cycle 3. However, directed studies interrogating small numbers of genes
indicate that their periodic transcription is governed by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs)4 . To determine the extent to which the global cell cycle transcription program is controlled
by cyclin/CDK complexes, we examined genome-wide transcription dynamics in budding yeast
mutant cells that do not express S-phase and mitotic cyclins. Here we show that a significant fraction
of periodic genes were aberrantly expressed in the cyclin mutant. Surprisingly, although cells lacking
cyclins are blocked at the G1/S border, nearly 70% of periodic genes continued to be expressed
periodically and on schedule. Our findings reveal that while CDKs play a role in the regulation of
cell cycle transcription, they are not solely responsible for establishing the global periodic
transcription program. We propose that periodic transcription is an emergent property of a
transcription factor network that can function as a cell cycle oscillator independent of, and in tandem
with, the CDK oscillator.
The biochemical oscillator controlling periodic events during the cell cycle is centered on the
activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (reviewed in ref. 5). The cyclin/CDK oscillator
governs the major events of the cell cycle, and in embryonic systems this oscillator functions
in the absence of transcription, relying only on maternal stockpiles of mRNAs and proteins.
CDKs are also thought to act as the central oscillator in somatic cells and yeast, and directed

studies suggest that they play an essential role in controlling the temporally ordered program
of transcription (reviewed in refs. 4,6). However, systems-level analyses using high throughput
technologies1,2,7,8  have suggested alternative models for regulation of periodic transcription
during the yeast cell cycle1,3,9. By correlating genome-wide transcription data with global
transcription factor binding data, models have been constructed in which periodic transcription
is an emergent property of a transcription network 1,3,9 . In these networks, transcription factors
expressed in one cell cycle phase bind to the promoters of genes encoding transcription factors
that function in a subsequent phase. Thus, the temporal program of transcription could be
controlled by sequential waves of transcription factor expression, even in the absence of
extrinsic control by cyclin/CDK complexes.
The validity and relevance of the intrinsically oscillatory transcription factor network
hypotheses remain uncertain, because for the limited number of periodic genes that have been
dissected in detail, periodic transcription was found to be governed by CDKs (reviewed in ref.
4). Thus, we sought to determine to what extent CDKs and transcription factor networks
contribute to global regulation of the cell cycle transcription program. To this end, we
investigated the dynamics of genome-wide transcription in budding yeast cells disrupted for
all S-phase and mitotic cyclins ( clb1,2,3,4,5,6 ). These cyclin mutant cells are unable to replicate
DNA, separate SPBs, undergo isotropic bud growth, or complete nuclear division, indicating
that they are devoid of functional Clb/CDK complexes10-12. So by conventional cell cycle
measures, clb1,2,3,4,5,6  cells arrest at the G1/S border. We have previously shown that
clb1,2,3,4,5,6  cells cyclically trigger G1 events10, including the activation of G1-specific
transcription and bud emergence. Nevertheless, if Clb/CDK activities are essential for
triggering the transcriptional program, then periodic expression of S-phase and G2/M-specific
genes should not be observed.
We examined global transcription dynamics in synchronized populations of both wild-type
cells and cyclin mutant cells. Synchronous populations of early G1 cells were collected by
centrifugal elutriation. Cell aliquots were then harvested at 16 min intervals for 270 min
(equivalent to ~2 cell cycles in wild-type and ~1.5 in the cyclin mutant). Transcript levels were
measured genome-wide for each time point using Yeast 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA). Results from two independent experiments each for both wild-type and
cyclin mutant cells were highly reproducible, with adjusted r2 values of 0.995 and 0.989,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). All statistical analyses were performed using replicate
data sets, but to facilitate illustration, single data sets were used for all graphical representations.
To identify periodically transcribed genes, we applied a modification of the method developed
by de Lichtenberg et al.13 to data acquired from our wild-type cells. We established a set of
1271 genes that were transcribed periodically (Fig. 1a, and Supplementary Table 1). This set
of periodic genes shares 510 and 577 genes with those sets previously identified as periodic
by Spellman et al.2 and Pramila et al.1, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2), with 440
consensus periodic genes identified by all three studies (Supplementary Table 2). We then
examined the transcriptional dynamics of our set of 1271 periodic genes in the cyclin mutant
(Fig. 1b). The behavior of many genes changed significantly in the cyclin mutant, supporting
previous findings. However, despite the fact that cyclin mutant cells arrest at the G1/S border,
a large fraction of periodic genes in all cell cycle phases continued to be expressed on schedule
(Fig. 1b). Similar cyclin-dependent and -independent behaviors are also observed in the set of
440 consensus periodic genes (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Using absolute change and Pearson correlation analyses (see Supplementary Information), we
determined that 833 of the periodic genes exhibited changes in expression behavior in the cyclin
mutant and thus are likely to be directly or indirectly regulated by B-cyclin/CDK.Orlando et al. Page 2

Our genome-level experiments accurately reproduced previous findings regarding several
well-studied B-cyclin/CDK-regulated genes (Fig. 2). We observed that a subset of late G1
transcripts (SBF-regulated genes like CLN2  but not MBF-regulated genes like RNR1 ) were not
fully repressed (Fig. 2a and b) as expected in mitotic cyclin mutant cells 14,15 . A subset of M/
G1 transcripts (including SIC1  and NIS1) , are targets of the transcription factors Swi5 and
Ace2, which are normally excluded from the nucleus by CDK phosphorylation until late
mitosis16-19. SIC1  and NIS1  were expressed earlier in the cyclin mutant (Fig. 2c and d)
presumably because nuclear exclusion of Swi5 and Ace2 is lost in cyclin mutant cells. The
modest degree of shift in the timing of SIC1  and NIS1  transcription likely reflects the fact that
SWI5  and ACE2  transcripts do not accumulate to maximal levels in cyclin mutant cells as
expected for Clb2 cluster genes (including CDC20 ) (Fig. 2e and f) 14,20,21. Although a
significant fraction of periodic genes exhibited changes in the amplitude of expression
(increased or decreased), a statistical analysis of the dynamic range of expression across all
periodic genes revealed that the majority of genes in cyclin mutant cells exhibit only modest
changes, if any, with respect to wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig. 4).
To identify novel subsets of co-regulated genes based on transcriptional behaviors observed
in both wild-type and cyclin mutant cells, we employed the affinity propagation algorithm22
to first cluster genes based on expression in wild-type cells, and then subcluster genes based
on their behavior in cyclin mutant cells (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Of the 833 cyclin-
regulated genes, 513 were assigned to 30 discrete clusters exhibiting similar behaviors in wild-
type cells (Fig. 3a, and Supplementary Fig. 6), and were then subclustered into 56 novel clusters
based on their transcription profiles in cyclin mutant cells (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table
3). Using data from global transcription factor localization studies 23, we identified subsets of
transcription factors that may regulate these subclusters using an over-representation analyses
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Based on their association with the promoters of genes in
cyclin-regulated subclusters, these factors are likely to be directly or indirectly regulated by
cyclins. Consistent with this hypothesis, several of these factors have already been shown to
be CDK targets14,15,18,19,24-29 . These findings lay the groundwork for elucidating the full
range of mechanisms by which cyclin/CDKs regulate transcription during the cell cycle.
Strikingly, 882 of the genes identified as periodic in wild-type cells, continued to be expressed
on schedule in cyclin mutant cells despite cell cycle “arrest” at the G1/S border (Fig. 4a and
b). Some of these genes (450 in total) exhibited minor changes in transcript behavior but
continued to be expressed at the proper time, as shown above for ACE2 . Thus, some genes that
were cyclin-regulated are also included in the set of genes that maintain periodicity.
Nevertheless, a statistical analysis of the dynamic range of expression of these genes in wild-
type and cyclin mutant cells indicates that the amplitude changes for most of these genes is
quite modest (see Supplementary Figs. 7, 8 and 9). The finding that nearly 70% of the genes
identified as periodic in wild-type cells are still expressed on schedule in cyclin mutant cells
demonstrates the existence of a cyclin/CDK-independent mechanism that regulates temporal
transcription dynamics during the cell cycle. This observation is supported by the analysis of
the set of 440 consensus periodic genes, the bulk of which maintain periodicity in the cyclin
mutant (Supplementary Fig. 10).
In principle, a transcription network defined by sequential waves of transcription factor
expression1,3,9 might function independent of any extrinsic control by CDKs. To determine
if a transcription network could account for cyclin/CDK-independent periodic transcription,
we constructed a synchronously updating Boolean network model and determined that such a
model can indeed explain the periodic expression patterns we observed in cyclin mutant cells
(Fig. 4c). Transcription factors that maintained periodicity in the cyclin mutant were placed
on a circularized cell cycle time line based on their peak time of transcription in the cyclin
mutant. Connections were drawn based on documented physical interactions23,30Orlando et al. Page 3

(Supplementary Table 5) between a transcription factor and the promoter region of a gene
encoding a transcription factor expressed subsequently (see Supplementary Information). The
architecture of the network in cyclin mutant cells is virtually identical to that in wild-type cells
(Supplementary Fig. 11), and is also remarkably similar to models based on wild-type
expression data from previous studies1,3,9.
When the network is endowed with Boolean logic functions (Supplementary Table 6a),
synchronous updating of the model leads to a cycle that produces successive waves of
transcription by progressing through five distinct states before returning to the initial state
(Supplementary Fig. 12a and b). Thus, the model functions as an oscillator and produces a
correctly-sequenced temporal program of transcription.
To examine the robustness of the network oscillator, we evaluated outcomes when initializing
the network from all possible starting states. Over 80% of the 512 starting states entered the
oscillatory cycle depicted in Fig. 4c, with the remainder terminating in a steady state where all
genes were transcriptionally inactive (Supplementary Table 6b and c). We also examined
whether the oscillations were sensitive to the choice of the Boolean logic functions assigned
to nodes with multiple inputs, specifically, the activating inputs to Cln3 and SFF, and the
repressors of SBF and Cln3. For most of the logic functions, the predominant outcome was
again the oscillatory cycle depicted in Fig. 4c, but in some cases, the model enters two
qualitatively similar cycles (Supplementary Fig. 12c and d, and Supplementary Table 6), with
the remainder again terminating in a transcriptionally inactive steady state. Several Boolean
logic functions produce the same cycles (Supplementary Table 6b), so the model cannot
precisely determine the true logic of the network connections. Nevertheless, the fact that the
model can produce qualitatively similar cycles, and that these cycles can be reached from many
initial states, suggests that robust oscillation is an emergent property of the network
architecture.
Previous studies proposed that a cyclin/CDK-independent oscillator could trigger some
periodic events, including bud emergence10. The robust oscillating character of our model
suggests that a transcription factor network may function as this cyclin/CDK-independent
oscillator. Because cyclin genes are themselves among the periodic genes targeted by this
network, and because cyclin/CDKs can, in turn, influence the behavior of transcription factors
in the network, precise cell cycle control could be achieved by coupling a transcription factor
network oscillator with the cyclin/CDK oscillator. The existence of coupled oscillators could
explain why the cell cycle is so robust to significant perturbations in gene expression or cyclin/
CDK activity.
Our findings also suggest that the properly scheduled expression of genes required for cell
cycle regulated processes such as DNA synthesis and mitosis is not sufficient for triggering
these events. The execution of cell cycle events in wild-type cells is likely to require both
properly timed transcription and post-transcriptional modifications mediated by CDKs.

Methods
Strains and cell synchronization
Yeast strains were grown in rich YEP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.012% adenine,
0.006% uracil) containing 2% galactose. Forty-five minutes prior to elutriation, dextrose was
added to YEP 2% galactose medium to terminate CLB1  expression from the GAL1  promoter.
After elutriation, wild-type and clb1,2,3,4,5,6 GAL1-CLB1  cells were grown in rich YEP 2%
dextrose,1M sorbitol at 30°C at a density of 107/ml. Sorbitol was added to stabilize cells with
elongated buds. Aliquots of 50ml (cell density = 107/ml) were harvested every 8 min for 4hr.
Budding index was determined microscopically by counting ≥ 200 cells for each time point.
Data analysis
CEL files from all 60 oligonucleotide arrays were normalized, and summarized using the dChip
method32 as implemented in the affy package (v.1.8.1) within Bioconductor using default
parameters. The output of this package is a measure of absolute expression levels for each
probe in arbitrary expression units (Fig. 2). Data presented in heat maps and centroid line graphs
(Figs. 1, 3, and 4, and Supplementary Figs. 3, 5, 8, 11,12, 15-18) are expressed as log2-fold
change for each gene relative to its mean expression over the interval from the first G1 to the
second S phase.
The CLOCCS population synchrony model31 was used to temporally align expression data
from our two wild-type and two cyclin mutant experiments. Briefly, the CLOCCS model allows
the alignment of data from multiple synchrony/time series experiments to a common cell cycle
time line using budding as a parameter measured on single cells at each time point 31. Although
cyclin mutant cells arrest at the G1/S border by conventional measures, G1 events, such as bud
emergence, are activated periodically with a cycle time similar to wild-type cells 10. Thus, the
CLOCCS model can be used to temporally align cycles in wild-type and cyclin mutant cells.
Because the kinetics of synchrony/release experiments can vary, and wild-type and cyclin
mutant cells have marginally different cycle times, alignment is imperative for meaningful
comparison of data. We used the CLOCCS parameter estimates to align all four data sets such
that the population level measurements were mapped onto a common cell cycle timeline. The
timeline utilizes standard cell cycle phases (as determined by measured parameters) and an
additional phase (Gr) corresponding to a period of recovery from the initial synchrony
procedure that overlaps with early G1 31. The recovery period (Gr) was eliminated from most
of the data displayed, as the genes expressed in this period tend to be specific to this period
and are not expressed again in the next cell cycle in either wild-type or cyclin mutant cells.
The CLOCCS model was designed for wild-type yeast populations but can accommodate data
from the cyclin mutant with minor modifications (see Supplementary Information). CLOCCS
model fits for both the wild-type and cyclin mutant datasets are shown in Supplementary Fig.
14, and the corresponding parameter estimates are shown in Supplementary Table 7.
A modification of the method described by de Lichtenberg 13 was used to determine the subset
of genes exhibiting periodic transcription (see Supplementary Information for details). The
methods used to identify genes with altered transcriptional profiles (Fig. 3), and similar profilesOrlando et al. Page 5

Abstract
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is probably the best-studied receptor system in mammalian
cells, and it also has become a popular example for employing mathematical modeling to cellular signaling networks.Dynamic models have the highest explanatory and predictive potential; however, the lack of kinetic information restricts
current models of EGFR signaling to smaller sub-networks. This work aims to provide a large-scale qualitative model that
comprises the main and also the side routes of EGFR/ErbB signaling and that still enables one to derive important functionalproperties and predictions. Using a recently introduced logical modeling framework, we first examined general topologicalproperties and the qualitative stimulus-response behavior of the network. With species equivalence classes, we introduce a
new technique for logical networks that reveals sets of nodes strongly coupled in their behavior. We also analyzed a model
variant which explicitly accounts for uncertainties regarding the logical combination of signals in the model. The predictivepower of this model is still high, indicating highly redundant sub-structures in the network. Finally, one key advance of this
work is the introduction of new techniques for assessing high-throughput data with logical models (and their underlying
interaction graph). By employing these techniques for phospho-proteomic data from primary hepatocytes and the HepG2cell line, we demonstrate that our approach enables one to uncover inconsistencies between experimental results and ourcurrent qualitative knowledge and to generate new hypotheses and conclusions. Our results strongly suggest that the Rac/
Cdc42 induced p38 and JNK cascades are independent of PI3K in both primary hepatocytes and HepG2. Furthermore, we
detected that the activation of JNK in response to neuregulin follows a PI3K-dependent signaling pathway.

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling
pathway is among the best studied receptor systems in mammaliancells. Signaling through EGFR (ErbB1) and its family members
ErbB2 (Her2/Neu2) ErbB3 and ErbB4 regulates cellular processes
such as survival, proliferation, differentiation and motility and
ErbB receptors are important targets for new and existing anti-
cancer drugs [1,2].
Mathematical modeling of the EGFR system started more than
25 years ago with efforts to describe binding to and internalization
of the receptor [3] that was followed by a variety of dynamic
models that deal with different aspects of the system (reviewed in
[4,5]). Whereas the first EGFR models focused on the receptoritself – internalization, ligand binding, and receptor homodimer-
ization [6] – later models included downstream signaling events
(e.g. [7–9]). More recent studies also address homo- and hetero-
dimerization among members of the ErbB receptor family and the
effects on downstream of binding to different ligands (of which 13are known; e.g. [10–13]). All these models describe aspects ofEGFR/ErbB signaling with a set of stoichiometric reactions and
the dynamics of the involved species is described by a set ofordinary differential equations (ODEs). In order to simulate themodel, the kinetic constants and initial concentrations of the
model have to be known or, more likely, they must be estimated.
Recently, a large-scale map was constructed by Kitano and
colleagues to capture the current state of knowledge about
interactions in the EGFR system as a stoichiometric network
[14]. This model contains no information on the reaction kineticsand is thus static and cannot be used to perform dynamicsimulations. Nonetheless, the Kitano map provides a reasonably
comprehensive list of molecules and interactions involved in EGF
signaling and represents an excellent starting point for studying itsglobal architecture [14–16]. Existing ODE-based models coveronly limited parts of the map, and parametric uncertainty presenteven in these smaller models suggests that it is not currently
practical to build an ODE model of the entire pathway having
high explanatory and predictive power. Instead, structural andqualitative (parameter-free) modeling approaches is the tool ofchoice. In fact, many important properties of a system rely solely
PLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 1 August 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e1000438
on the often well-known network structure, including many that
govern dynamic behavior; feedback loops, for example, are
captured in the wiring diagram.
Whereas structural (stoichiometric) analysis of metabolic
networks is quite well established [17], relatively few efforts have
been made thus far to study qualitatively the propagation of
information in signaling networks. Efforts to date include statisticalanalyses of interaction graphs of large-scale protein-protein
networks (e.g. [18]) and other approaches that rely on graph
theory (e.g. [15,19]). Petri net theory [20,21] and constraint-based
modeling [22] have also been used to unravel structural properties
of signal transduction networks.
Boolean (discrete logic) description of interaction networks has
quite a long tradition in theoretical biology. In the past, it has beenmainly applied to random networks [23] or gene regulatory
networks of moderate size (e.g. [24–27]). However, we have
recently developed a Boolean framework that is specifically
tailored to signaling networks. In contrast to gene regulatory
networks, signaling networks are usually structured into input,
processing and output layers. This approach has recently been
applied successfully to a large-scale model of T cell signaling [28],and used in concert with high-throughput data to analyze cell-
specific network topologies (Saez-Rodriguez et al, in preparation).
Within this framework, we have set-up a logical model of the
main parts of the stoichiometric model of EGFR signaling [14]
and additionally of signaling through ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4.
As mentioned above, the stoichiometric model of Oda et al [14]
does not allow for dynamic simulations. Also functional issuesrelated to network structure can be studied only to a minor extent
because the stoichiometric model is limited regarding the analysis
of signal flows relevant in signaling networks. By translating the
stoichiometric (mass-flow based) into a logical (signal-flow based)
representation, we obtain an executable model facilitating
functional predictions about input-output responses of a very
complex signaling cascade. Our model comprises 104 species and204 interactions and is among the largest of a mammaliansignaling network but we have recently become aware of the
interesting work of Helikar et al[29] who also studied a large-scale
Boolean network containing parts of the EGFR/ErbB induced
signaling pathways. Their work focuses on a statistical analysis of
the possible (non-deterministic) discrete behaviors of their Booleanmodel. In contrast, our model provides deterministic and testablepredictions about responses and we have verified many using
functional data. In the process, we have uncovered non-obvious
functional properties of the ErbB signaling pathway that are likelyto be biologically significant.
This paper is organized as follows: the first part describes how
we translated the stoichiometric EGFR/ErbB model of Oda et al
[14] into a logical model via a set of general rules. The second part
presents results from a theoretical analysis of the network
including, for example, a characterization of feedback structureand identification of network components whose behavior isstrongly coupled. The final section describes application of the
logical model to interpret functional data in which primary human
hepatocytes and hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 were exposedto different ErbB ligands in combination with inhibitors of
intracellular signaling kinases. We show that a Boolean model of
ErbB signaling can generate experimentally verifiable predictionsabout input-output behavior in the face of perturbation and thatnew hypotheses about biological function can be generated
Results
From a stoichiometric to a logical model for EGFR/ErbB
signaling
Based on a stoichiometric model of EGF receptor signaling [14]
and additional information from the literature, we built a logical
model that describes signaling induced by 13 members of the EGFligand family through ErbB1-4, leading to the activation of variouskinases and transcription factors that effect proliferation, growth
and survival (see Figure 1 and Table S1). Ligand binding causes
the formation of eight different ErbB-dimers that autophosphor-ylate and then provide docking sites for adaptor proteins such as
Gab1, Grb2 and Shc, which transmit signals to the small G
proteins Ras and Rac, leading to the activation of MAPKcascades. Among these, ERK1/2 is the best studied but our modelalso comprises the JNK and p38 cascades. Highly interconnected
with the MAPKs and also downstream of the ErbB receptors is
PI3K/Akt signaling, another major branch of the model.Furthermore, activation of different STATs and the PLC c/PKC
pathway are included.
Our model contains most parts of the stoichiometric model of
Oda et al[14]. However, endocytosis, the G1/S transition of the
cell cycle as well as the crosstalk with the G protein coupled
receptor signaling cascade are not considered in our model as wefocus here on early signaling events induced by external stimuli(EGF-type ligands). In contrast, our model considers signaling
through all different ErbB dimers (in addition to EGFR
homodimers), which was not part of the stoichiometric model(though a simplified diagram has been given in [14]). Finally, there
are some reactions and species that are only contained in the
logical model so as to use the data set (e.g. the mammalian targetof rapamycin (mTOR), p70S6 kinase). Differences between thestoichiometric and the logical model regarding considered
components and interactions are also explained in the model
documentation (see Table S1).
Translating a stoichiometric model into a logical model is not a
trivial task and requires additional information. Whenever a speciesis only influenced by one upstream molecule, the interpretation as aBoolean function is straightforward: the downstream species isAuthor Summary
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling
pathway is arguably the best-characterized receptor
system in mammalian cells and has become a prime
example for mathematical modeling of cellular signaltransduction. Most of these models are constructed todescribe dynamic and quantitative events but, due to the
lack of precise kinetic information, focus only on certain
regions of the network. Qualitative modeling approachesrelying on the network structure provide a suitable way todeal with large-scale networks as a whole. Here, we
constructed a comprehensive qualitative model of the
EGFR/ErbB signaling pathway with more than 200interactions reflecting our current state of knowledge. A
theoretical analysis revealed important topological and
functional properties of the network such as qualitativestimulus-response behavior and redundant sub-structures.Subsequently, we demonstrate how this qualitative model
can be used to assess high-throughput data leading to
new biological insights: comparing qualitative predictions(such as expected ‘‘ups’’ and ‘‘downs’’ of activation levels)of our model with experimental data from primary human
hepatocytes and from the liver cancer cell line HepG2, we
uncovered inconsistencies between measurements andmodel structure. These discrepancies lead to modificationsin the EGFR/ErbB signaling network relevant at least for
liver biology.The Logic of ErbB Signaling

active (state 1) if and only if the state of the upstream species is 1 (vice
versa if the influence is negative) (see Figure 2A). In some other cases
it is clear how to code the dependency in a logical function – for
example, the formation of a complex (e.g. the heterodimerization of
c-Jun and c-Fos to the transcription factor AP-1 (see Figure 2B) or
binding of a ligand to a receptor), where all involved proteins have
to be present to trigger downstream events and are thus connected
with an AND gate. Furthermore, we use an OR gate whenever a
protein can be recruited through different receptors or adapter
proteins (see Figure 2C).
However, in many cases the stoichiometric information is not
sufficient to approximate the activation level of a species as alogical function of the states of its upstream effectors and one
requires additional (mainly qualitative) information, which can
often be obtained from the literature.The two main cases that can arise are the following:
NA species is positively influenced by two (or more) upstream
molecules, for example a protein that can be phosphorylated
by different kinases (see Figure 2D). Here, the decision whether
both kinases are necessary or if one suffices, that is whether touse an AND or an OR, cannot be made on the basis of theinformation that is contained in a stoichiometric model.However, the necessary information can often be obtainedfrom related literature (e.g. from knock-out studies where oneof both effectors has been removed, or if an inhibitor isavailable for an upstream species).
NA species is positively influenced by one species (for example a
kinase) and negatively influenced by another (for example a
phosphatase). In this case, we cannot be sure what happensFigure 1. Logical model of the EGF-/ErbB receptor signaling pathway represented in ProMoT .Blue circles symbolize AND connections.

Figure 2. Examples illustrating the translation of the stoichiometric EGFR model into a logical description. The examples are taken
from the stoichiometric map of Oda et al [14].AThe activation level of MKK7 is only influenced by one upstream molecule (active MEKK1). Bc-Jun
and c-Fos form the transcription factor AP-1. Accordingly, both species are combined with an AND gate (denoted by ‘‘ ?’’ in the logical equations). C
Gab1 can bind directly to EGFR homodimers or via receptor-bound Grb2. For the activation of downstream elements, the activation mechanism ofGab2 does not make a difference what results in a logical OR connection represented by two (independent) activation arrows: Grb2 RGab1 OR
EGFRRGab1. DIn this example, we cannot immediately decide whether both Raf-1 and MEKK1 are necessary for the activation of MKK1 (in the
model description we use the synonym MEK1) or if the activation of one of these two kinases suffices. Further information is required or an ITT gate
can be used (in model M1 we used an OR based on facts published in the literature).doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000438.g002The Logic of ErbB Signaling

when both the kinase and the phosphatase are present; it will
depend on the respective strength (described as kineticparameters in a quantitative model) and may differ in different
cell types. However, the activation of phosphatases often
occurs as a temporarily secondary event upon stimulating asignaling pathway (required for switching off the signal). They
may therefore be neglected when considering the early events,
i.e. the initial response of the network that follows uponstimulation (see below).
We also have to keep in mind that, in all cases, the logical
description is only a discrete approximation of a quantitative
reaction. In those cases where neither an AND nor an OR is agood approximation, we can use incomplete truth tables [30]. This
operator, herein after referred to as ‘‘ITT gate’’, returns 1 if and
only if all positive arguments are 1 and all negative arguments are0, and returns 0 if and only if all positive arguments are 0 and all
negative arguments are 1. In all other cases, no decision can be
made and the response of the molecule remains undefined. UsingITT gates may limit the determinacy of the model (when
performing stimulus-response simulations it can happen that some
states cannot be determined uniquely), but it allows for a saferinterpretation of the results. To illustrate this concept and to
discuss uncertainties in our reconstructed logical model (in the
following referred to as model M1) we consider a model variantM2 where the activation mechanisms of 14 proteins are described
with ITT gates reflecting the uncertainties in the logical
description of M1 (see Table S2). In this way model M2 accountsexplicitly for the uncertainties in the logical concatenation of
different signals, however, it cannot account for uncertainties that
are captured in the wiring diagram itself.
Whenever we refer in the following to ‘‘the logical model’’ we
refer to M1 if not stated otherwise.
Once the network construction has been completed, one may
start to perform discrete simulations. We will not study the
transient behavior of the network; instead we propagate the signalsfrom the input to the output layer. Mathematically, we compute
the logical steady state that follows from exposing the network to a
certain input stimulus (possibly in combination with networkinterventions; see Methods). In this way we can analyze the
qualitative input-output behavior of the network. Feedback loops,
which can be identified in the interaction graph underlying thelogical model, may hamper this kind of analysis of the discrete
behavior of logical networks (especially negative feedback loops
[30]). However, herein we will focus on the initial response of thenetwork nodes induced by external stimulations or perturbations.
Assuming that the system is in a pseudo-steady state at the
beginning, the initial response of a node is governed by the pathsconnecting the inputs with this node whereas feedback loops are
secondary events that can only be activated at a later time point
when each node in the loop has exhibited its initial response.Although path/cycle length is no precise measure for the velocity
of signal transduction, the comparable average length of input/
output paths (19) and feedback loops (17) supports the assumptionthat the initial response of the network nodes is dominated by the
input/output paths whereas feedback loops may overwrite the
initial response of the network nodes only after a certain timeperiod with significant length (again, feedback loops can causally
not be activated before the initial response occurred). To decouple
the initial response from the activity of the feedback loops, weproceed as follows: we assign to each reaction a time variable t
determining whether the reaction is active/available during the
initial response (i.e. is an early event; t= 1) or not (late event;
t= 2). In each negative feedback loop we identify the node Z thathas the shortest distance to the input layer. This node Z can be
considered as the initialization point of the feedback loop and wethen assign t= 2 to the ‘‘last’’ interaction of the feedback loop
closing the cycle in node Z (i.e. points into Z). For example, in a
causal chain
InputRARBRC--|DRB we would consider D RB as a late
event. In this way we interrupt the feedback loop and the logicalsteady states computed in the network reflect the initial response ofthe nodes. Strikingly, it is sufficient to consider only four interactionsas late event to break all feedback loops (see below) in the network.
With this acyclic network a unique logical steady state follows for
any set of input values in model M1. The assignment ‘‘late’’ was notonly reasonable for selected interactions in feedback loops, but alsofor three interactions involved in negative feed-forward loops down-regulating the signaling after a certain time. The time variables foreach reaction can be found in Table S1. Although ‘‘late’’interactions are neglected when calculating the early signalpropagation, they are nevertheless important to describe structuralproperties of the network that can be derived from the interactiongraph representation (see below). It is also important to mention thatthe logical steady state computed for a given scenario (see Methods)does not necessarily reflect the activation pattern in the cell at one
particular point of time. Instead, it reflects for each species the initial
response to the stimulus. The time range in which this initialresponse takes place can differ for each molecule – typically, aspecies situated in the upper part of the network (e.g. a receptor)responses faster to the stimulus than a species of the output layer(e.g. a transcription factor).
We set-up models M1 and M2 with ProMoT [31] and exported
the mathematical description as well as the graphical representa-
tion to the analysis tool CellNetAnalyzer (CNA) [32]. The results
obtained with CNA have been re-imported to and visualized in
ProMoT .
The logical model is represented as logical interaction
hypergraph (see Methods) and contains 104 nodes and 204hyperarcs (interactions). Seven interactions are configured as lateevents (see Table S1), so their time scale is set to 2. Two
interactions are only considered in the analysis of the interaction
graph but excluded in the logical analysis as they do not changethe logical function of their target node or as the exact mechanismof the interaction is unknown (see Table S1). 28 nodes are inputs ofthe model, i.e. their regulation is not explicitly considered in themodel but can be used to simulate different scenarios. Besidesligands and receptors, these include for example some phospha-tases with unknown activation mechanism. For all input nodes, adefault value is given in Table S1 (and is indicated in Figure 1) thatis used for the logical analyses unless otherwise specified.
Topological properties of the interaction graph
A logical model in hypergraph form has a unique underlying
interaction graph (see Methods) capturing merely positive and
negative effects between the elements (instead of deterministic
logic functions). Importantly, the usage of ITT gates in model M2does not change the underlying interaction graph implying that allresults obtained in this section are valid for both M1 and M2. Agraph-theoretical analysis of the interaction graph enables us toderive important topological properties of the network, indepen-dently of the Boolean description. For example, the existence offeedback loops is necessary for inducing multistationarity (positivefeedback loops) or oscillatory behavior (negative loops) of thedynamic system [33,34]. In our model, the underlying interactiongraph has 236 feedback loops, thereof 139 negative. Strikingly, allpositive feedback loops are composed of a negative feed-forward
and a negative feedback, except one that describes the reciprocalThe Logic of ErbB Signaling

activation of the adaptor protein Gab1 and PIP3, a lipid of the
membrane layer [35]. All negative feedback loops arise from five
mechanisms: (i) the kinases ERK1/2 and p90RSK downregulate
their own activation by phosphorylation of SOS1, a guaninenucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras, (ii) the phosphataseSHP1 binds to the autophosphorylated ErbB1-homodimers anddephosphorylates them, (iii) Ras positively influences its GTPaseactivating protein RasGAP via PI3K, (iv) the ubiquitin ligase c-Cblbinds to ErbB1, leading to degradation of the receptor in thelysosome and (v) Ras potentiates the Rab5a-GEF activity of Rin1and thus increases the formation of endocytic vesicles. Therefore,
removing the species Ras and ErbB1-homodimer breaks all
negative feedback loops. As described above, when considering theearly response in the model the ‘‘last’’ interaction closing afeedback loop is considered as late event (see Table S1). It turnedout that assigning only four interactions the ‘‘late’’ attribute t=2
suffices not only to break all negative feedback loops, but also thepositive ones, so that no feedback loop remains in the networkwhen considering the early events.
In terms of graph theory, a feedback loop is (per definition) a
strongly connected subgraph, i.e. if two species Aand Bare part ofa directed cycle it always holds that there exists a path from AtoB
and from BtoA. In our model, all feedback loops build up one
strongly connected component consisting of 34 species, meaningthat all feedbacks are coupled.
Figure 3 shows the participation of the different species in the
feedback loops. Remarkably, the small G protein Ras is includedin 98% of the loops, underlining its central role in the regulation of
this network. Ras is a key regulator of cell fate [36] and a known
oncogene in many human cancers [37]. However, the highnumber of feedbacks containing Ras in our model can also reflectthe fact that Ras is one of the best studied proteins and thereforethe feedback mechanisms of Ras are possibly better known than
those of other proteins.
Also noteworthy, RN-tre, a GTPase activating protein (GAP)
for Rab5a, is only involved in positive loops, whereas the guanine
nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5a, Rin1, takes only part in
negative feedbacks.
The large size of the network gives rise to a high number of
possible signaling paths along which one node may affect another
one. There are, for instance, 6786 paths (thereof 52% negative)leading from the input (ligand) EGF to the transcription factor AP-
Figure 3. Species participation in the feedback loops. The darker a species is colored, the more loops it participates in. Colorless species are
not part of feedback loops. All colored species build up one strongly connected component in the underlying interaction graph.doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000438.g003The Logic of ErbB Signaling

1 in the output layer. Considering only the early events, 1684
paths remain being 25% of them negative, where all these negativepaths include the node RasGAP.
The information whether a species acts positively (activating)
or/and negatively (inhibiting) on another species, i.e. whetherthere is any positive or/and negative path linking the two species,can be stored and visualized as dependency matrix [30]. The
dependency matrix for the early events contains ambivalentdependencies (i.e. a node has positive and negative effects on othernodes) that mainly rely on the negative influence of RasGAP: as itinhibits Ras, it gives rise to a number of negative paths connecting
the activated receptors with proteins downstream of Ras – inaddition to the positive paths via SOS1, an activator for Ras. Notconsidering RasGAP leads to a matrix where only a fewambivalent interactions occur (see Figure 4): for example, thereceptor ErbB2 is an ambivalent factor for almost all downstreamelements as it is the preferred heterodimerization partner of theother receptors and thus prevents signaling through variousdifferent dimers (for example, ErbB1/ErbB3 formation isrepressed if ErbB2 is present). When all interactions are active,

the dependency matrix contains more ambivalent interactions
than it does when considering only the early events.
Note that, except for ambivalent dependencies, the qualitative
effect (up/down) of perturbations can be unambiguously predicted
from the dependency matrix and we will make use of this
technique when analyzing experimental data (see below).
Theoretical analysis of the logical model
Implementing a Boolean function in each node of the
interaction graph enables us to calculate the qualitative network
response to a certain stimulus or perturbation and to predict the
effects of interventions. Given the binary states for the inputvariables and optionally for species that have a fixed value (e.g.
simulating a knock-out or knock-in), one determines the resulting
logical steady state by propagating the signals according to thelogical function of the nodes (see Methods).
Using this technique, we determined the network response in
model M1 upon stimulation with the different ligands, againfocusing on the early events (i.e. the interactions with t= 2 were set
to zero). Due to the fact that the resulting network is acyclic (as
explained above), a unique logical steady state follows for any setof input values in model M1.
We found that the outputs can be divided into two groups: the
majority of the output elements can be activated by all possible
dimers. However, PKC, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 can only be
activated through ErbB1-homodimers (PKC, STAT1, STAT3) orErbB1-homodimers and ErbB2/ErbB4-dimers (STAT5). Accord-
ingly, stimulation with neuregulins does not result in activation of
the protein kinase PKC and the transcription factors STAT1 andSTAT3, in contrast to stimulation with the other ligands that
activate all output molecules except the pro-apoptotic effect of
BAD which is repressed. This is due to the fact that theneuregulins, unlike the other ligands, do not bind to ErbB1 andthus cannot activate ErbB1-homodimers.
Strikingly, despite of the 14 ITT gates in model M2, the logical
steady state in response to ErbB1-homodimers can still be
determined in model M2 and does not differ from M1. This
observation reflects a high degree of redundancy in at least someparts of the network. The state of each of the different kinases
phosphorylating p38 or MKK4 is for example only dependent on
the activity of Rac/Cdc42 so that these kinases are alwaysactivated together (see below). Thus, the input–output behavior of
the network can be uniquely predicted for all ligands except
neuregulins. In contrast, model M2 fails to predict the response forsome nodes if other dimers (in absence of the ErbB1-homodimer)
are stimulated. This concerns in particular most of the output
nodes; the states of PKC, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 can bedetermined (as in model M1, these proteins can only be activatedby ErbB1-homodimers, except STAT5 that is ‘‘on’’ in response to
ErbB2/ErbB4-dimers) whereas the state of the other output nodes
cannot be calculated. The indeterminacy of M2 with respect tostimulations of dimers others than ErbB1-homodimers can be
explained by the uncertainty (ITT gate) in the activation of Rac/
Cdc42.
When performing simulations with M1, we realized that certain
species in the network show strongly coupled behavior. Thisguided us to search systematically for equivalence classes of
network nodes whose activation pattern is completely coupled: for
species Aand Bbeing elements of the same equivalence class, it
either holds that their states are always the same ( A=0uB=0 ,
A=1uB= 1; positive coupling) or always the opposite
(A=0uB=1 , A=1uB= 0; negative coupling) irrespective of
the chosen inputs. In other words, the state of one species in theequivalence class determines the states of all other species in thisclass. Hence, whenever a species of a particular equivalence class is
active, we can conclude that all other species of the sameequivalence class must have been activated (deactivated in case ofnegative coupling), at least transiently.
An algorithm to compute the equivalence classes efficiently is
given in the Methods section. In general, equivalence classes can
be computed for a given scenario (defined by a specific (possibly
empty) set of fixed states, typically from input nodes). For thisgiven scenario we test systematically for each species whether it iscompletely coupled with other nodes or not.
This type of coupling analysis is very similar to enzyme (or
reaction) subsets known from metabolic networks [38,39] and ithelps to uncover functional couplings embedded in the network
structure. We anticipate that the concept of equivalence classes
also provides a basis for model reduction (e.g. when computinglogical steady states), similar as it has been employed in metabolicnetworks (see e.g. [40]).
Figure 5 shows the equivalence classes in the EGFR/ErbB
model for early signal propagation where the states (presence) of allligands and receptors were left open (the states of the other inputs
were fixed to their default value as given in the model description
(see Table S1)). We found six equivalence classes, the largestcomprising 24 species. The latter includes parts of PI3K signalingas well as the Rac induced parts of the MAPK cascades reflecting
the strong coupling of these two major pathways in model M1.
In model M2, this equivalence class splits into three smaller ones
because the ITT gates introduce uncertainties that may lead to a
decoupling of the two pathways. The other equivalence classes of
M2 hardly differ from the ones in M1 (see Figure S1) againindicating that alternative pathways contribute rather to a higher
degree of redundancy than to a higher degree of freedom
regarding the potential input-output behavior.
Another concept relying on the logical description is the
computation of minimal intervention sets (MIS; [30,32]). An MIS
is a set of interventions that induces a certain response, whereas nosubset of the MIS does (i.e. an MIS is support-minimal). Oneapplication of MIS is to determine failure modes in the network
that lead to an activation of elements of the output layer without
any external stimulation of the cell. In the EGFR/ErbB model weare interested in failures that stimulate proliferation and growth ofthe cell when no ligand is present. Regarding the early events,
constitutive activation of Ras, for example, leads to activation of
the transcription factors Elk1, CREB, AP-1 and c-Myc, the p70S6kinase, the heat shock protein Hsp27 and represses apoptosis –without any external stimulus. Besides Ras, it is sufficient to
permanently activate one of the species Gab1, Grb2, PI3K, PIP3
or Shc to activate/inhibit these outputs. In model M2, the minimalintervention sets to provoke the above mentioned response containat least two elements, for example the activation of Grb2 and
Vav2.
These findings show that the network has fragile points where a
mutated protein (e.g. one that is constitutively active) may support
uncontrolled growth and proliferation. However, besides ErbB
signaling, various other pathways are important for the regulationof growth and apoptosis and a failure in one pathway might becompensated by another, what makes it important to include these
pathways step by step into our model. Additionally, when building
up the model we did not focus on one certain cell type, but
collected species and interactions that have been detected indifferent kinds of cells leading to a kind of ‘‘master model’’. A
model that describes only one cell type would probably include less
interactions (Saez-Rodriguez et al, in preparation), so that a
(constitutive) signal has not such a global (network-wide) influenceas in the master model.The Logic of ErbB Signaling

Analyzing high-throughput experimental data
One of the strengths of our model lies in the broad range of
pathways it covers and in the easy simulation of the network wideresponse to different stimulations and interventions. It is thereforewell-suited to analyze high-throughput data where variousreadouts are measured in response to several stimuli and to
perturbations all over the network. Here we discuss the analysis of
two datasets collected in primary human hepatocytes and thehepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. In the first set of measurements- a subset of the ‘‘CSR liver compendium’’ (Alexopoulos et al,i n
preparation) - primary cells and HepG2 cells were stimulated withtransforming growth factor alpha (TGF a) and additionally treated
with seven different small-molecule drugs, whereof six inhibit theactivation of nodes considered in our model. For the second dataset, HepG2 cells were stimulated with different ligands of the EGFfamily and treated with an inhibitor for PI3K. In both cases, thephosphorylation state of 11 signaling proteins included in the ErbBmodel were measured after 0, 30 and 180 minutes (see Methodsfor a more detailed description of the experiments). Here, we onlyfocus on the early response of the network after 30 minutesbecause we want to analyze which proteins become activated at
all. We assume that in hepatocytes only ErbB1 and ErbB3 areexpressed as it has been reported for adult rat liver [41]; thus, for
the analysis of the hepatocyte data, the state values of the other
two receptors (ErbB2 and ErbB4) were set to 0 in the model.
As discussed earlier, our modeling framework is based on two
concepts: (i) the Boolean (logical) description discretizing thekinetic behavior, and (ii) the underlying interaction graphreflecting the topology of interactions. This gives rise to two
different approaches for the analysis of the data. First, using the
dependency matrix of the interaction graph, we examined whetherthe experimental results are in accordance to the causaldependencies in our network. Second, using the logical model,
we predicted the binary network response to the different
experimental stimuli and compared these predictions with adiscretized version of the data.
Interaction graph-based data analysis
In the experiments, the phosphorylation state of the readouts is
measured in response to a particular set of stimuli by addingFigure 5. Equivalence classes in the EGFR/ErbB model. Each color represents one equivalence class. Species with no color are not part of any
equivalence class. The states for the ligands and the four receptor monomers are left open, all other inputs are fixed to their default value (see TableS1), which is indicated by the red (0) and green (1) diamonds. Late events are excluded and therefore shown as dotted lines (see also figure 1).doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000438.g005The Logic of ErbB Signaling
PLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 9 August 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e1000438
certain ligands and/or inhibitors and combinations thereof. For
each pair of treatments it can then be checked whether the ratio of
the measured responses is consistent with the causal dependenciesin the network topology (as captured in the dependency matrix;
Figure 4) or not.
By comparing the measured phosphorylation state of a protein p
under treatment A,X
p(A), with the measured value for punder
treatment B,Xp(B), we can characterize the effect of the difference
of both treatments on the activation level of p. We restrict
ourselves here to comparing treatments that differ only in adding
or removing one ligand or inhibitor, although, in principle, all
possible pairwise comparisons of treatments could be considered.
As an example, assume we compare the phosphorylation state
Xp(A) of protein pin response to a stimulation A, where a ligand l
and inhibitor iwere added, with the state Xp(B)o fpin response to
treatment B, where only the inhibitor iwas added. An increase in
the phosphorylation state of protein pin response to the addition of
the ligand (i.e. Xp(A)/Xp(B).1) indicates that there must be at least
one positive path leading from this ligand to the protein and the
respective entry in the dependency matrix (row l, column p) of the
model should therefore show an activating or at least ambivalentinfluence.
Analogously, for studying the influence of a certain inhibitor, a
decrease (increase) in the data in response to inhibiting a certainprotein indicates that there must be at least one positive (negative)
path leading from the inhibited species to the respective readout.
We decided to consider a change in the data as significant if
X
p(A)/Xp(B).1.5 or if Xp(A)/Xp(B),1/1.5. Figures 6 and 7 show
the comparison of the data with the dependency matrix of themodel where we considered only the early events and neglected
the influence of RasGAP (as discussed above).
All in all, the experimental network response to the different
treatments agrees reasonably well with the structure of the model,
in particular in primary cells. In HepG2 cells, 10% of the analyzed
dependencies are contradictory to our model: in 3% (7%) of thecases we saw a significant increase (decrease) in the activation level,
although this was excluded by the model. 45% of the cases agreed
explicitly with the model: in 28% (5%) of the cases, treatments thathave a purely positive (negative) influence according to the
dependency matrix resulted in a significant increase (decrease) in
the measured activation levels and in 12% of the cases a ligand/inhibitor causes no significant change in a measured readout as
predicted in the model. In the remaining 45% of the cases (gray
entries in Figure 7), the data show no significant change, althoughthe stimulus can affect the readout in our model (many of these
gray entries will be discussed below). In primary cells, 13% of the
predictions were false, 74% were fully correct and for 13% weobserved no significant changes, although the model contains
paths between the stimulus and the readout. A discussion of
specific findings is given below together with the result of thelogical model.
Data analysis with the logical model
Whereas the dependency analysis described above is based on
the raw data, a comparison of the data with the binary network
response of the logical model requires a discretization of the data,the simplest being a binarization. To obtain the discretized values,
we used DataRail , a recently introduced MATLAB toolbox that
facilitates the linkage of experimental data to mathematical models[42]. It provides a variety of methods for data processing,
including algorithms to convert continuous data into binary values
and to create convenient data structures for the analysis inCellNetAnalyzer . The discretization depends on three thresholds (p1,
p2, p3) which all have to be exceeded in order to discretize themeasured signal to ‘‘on’’ [42]: the first threshold is for the relative
significance (the ratio between the value at time 1 (in our case after
30 minutes) and the value at time 0), the second threshold ensures
theabsolute significance (ratio between the signal and the maximum
value for this signal from all measurements) and the third thresholdascertains that the signal is above experimental noise. The choice
of the thresholds is quite difficult as no reference data exist that
define when a molecule is ‘‘on’’, that is when it is sufficiently
activated to induce its downstream events. Most likely, the
required level of activation differs from protein to protein andfrom cell to cell. However, since no information on these
differences is available and to avoid unnecessary degrees of
freedom, we decided to define the same thresholds for allmolecules and both cell types (p1 = 1.5, p2 = 0.15, p3 = 100).
Figure S2 shows the sensitivities of the binarization with respect to
these three parameters.
For each measured scenario we computed the binary network
response of our model and compared it with the discretized data(Figure 8). We note that the comparison of the measured ‘‘ups and
downs’’ with the dependency matrix (performed in the previous
section) and the comparison of the discretized data with thepredicted logical response are naturally correlated. However, they
do not lead necessarily to exactly the same results. An example:
assume you have an input stimulus (ligand L) which may activate a
target species S via two independent pathways, one of both leading
over an intermediate species A for which we have an inhibitor I. Ifwe compare the scenario ‘‘stimulation with L and adding inhibitor
I’’ against ‘‘stimulating with L’’ via dependency analysis we would
expect a decrease in the (non-discretized) activation level of S sincethe inhibited species A is an activator for S. However, the
phosphorylation state of S might show no significant change in the
dependency analysis (i.e. leads to a ‘‘gray entry’’ as in Figures 6and 7) due to the alternative pathway not affected by the inhibitor.
In contrast, if the two pathways from L to S are OR-connected in
the logical model, the latter would still predict S to be ‘‘on’’.Another difference in the data analysis based on dependency
matrix vs. logical model is that the former compares species states
obtained from two different experiments (e.g. experiment with/
without inhibitor) whereas the logical model gives for each
experiment one (independent) prediction for each species.
As in the case of the dependency analysis, the measured data
agree reasonably well with the predictions of the model M1
(HepG2: 77% correct predictions; primary cells: 90% correct
predictions).
In Figure S3, the comparison of model M2 with the
experimental data is shown. For primary cells, only 7% of the
states cannot be determined due to the ITT gates, for HepG2
21%. 83% of the predictions for primary cells and 59% for HepG2
were correct. In all cases where a state can be predicted by M2 it
naturally coincides with the prediction from M1 since the latter isonly one special case of all possible behaviors in model M2.
In some cases where we used an ITT gate in model M2, the
logical function can be uniquely determined with the experimental
results confirming some of the deterministic logic gates used in
model M1: for example, the transcription factor CREB can beactivated through the MEK-dependent kinase p90RSK AND/OR
through the p38 dependent MK2. As CREB is still activated both
with MEK inhibitor and with p38 inhibitor, this points to an OR-connection achieving a match between model predictions and data
in this node. In the same way, we can verify an AND connection
for the two negative modulators of Gsk3 and an OR for thephosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory domain of p70S6 kinase.
Again, using ITT gates, we can only reflect uncertainties
regarding the logical combination of different paths and notThe Logic of ErbB Signaling
PLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 10 August 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e1000438
whether a species influences another at all. This is why some of the
discrepancies between the predictions of model M1 and the data
also appear for model M2.
Interpreting inconsistencies between data and model
predictions
Most disagreements between model predictions and experi-
mental results concentrate on certain experimental conditions(rows) and readouts (columns) - in the dependency analysis as well
as in the analysis with the logical model. Here we discuss such
systematic inconsistencies and – using our model – we seek to
provide explanations and conclusions:NA significantly increased state of phosphorylation of STAT3 in
response to any of the ligands could not be found both in
HepG2 and primary hepatocytes. Whether this is due to the
fact that the activation of STAT3 is very transient, as it hasbeen reported for example for the human epithelial carcinoma
cell line A431 [43], or if the activation of this transcription
factor through ErbB receptors plays no role in hepatocytes, hasstill to be clarified.
NBoth analysis approaches show that stimulation of HepG2 cells
with amphiregulin (not measured in primary cells) did not
result in activation of the measured proteins (see Figure 7, lines34–37 and Figure 8B, lines 23/24). This is in agreement withFigure 6. Interaction graph-based comparison between experimental data and topological properties of the model (data from
primary hepatocytes). Shown is the comparison between the measured and predicted changes (‘‘ups’’ and ‘‘downs’’) in the activation levels of
network elements in response to ligands and inhibitors in primary human hepatocytes (data obtained from Alexopoulos et al , in preparation). Each
row compares two different scenarios Aand B. A dot behind the species name in the row labels indicates that, in both scenario Aand scenario B, this
species was added as ligand (green dot) or an inhibitor for this species was added (red dot). Species whose input values differ in both scenarios are
marked with an up or down arrow, respectively. For example, the comparison of scenario A(EGF ligand, TGF aligand, PI3K inhibitor) and scenario B
(TGF aligand, PI3K inhibitor) is labeled by TGF aN(green dot), PI3K N(red dot), EGF q, i.e. the influence of an increased level of EGF on the readouts is
analyzed (under the side constraints that TGF aand a PI3K inhibitor were added as well; for further explanations see text). The readouts are shown in
the columns. The color indicates whether the model predictions and the measurements are consistent or not (see color legend).doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000438.g006The Logic of ErbB Signaling

findings of amphiregulin being a much weaker growth
stimulator than EGF in some cell types [44].
NThe systematic errors in the column of p38 in the dependency
analysis (for primary as well as HepG2 cells) might indicatemissing edges in the model requiring further experimentalstudies to verify these findings. We cannot exclude that other
(e.g. stress-induced) pathways not captured in our model may
have caused these observations, also because some of theeffects on p38 are also present without ligand stimulation.
NStimulating the HepG2 cells with both TGF aand EGF does
not result in a significantly higher activation level of the
readouts compared to adding only one of these ligands as canbe seen from the predominantly gray entries in lines 26/27 and44/45 in Figure 7. This finding is in accordance with the factthat both ligands are very similar and bind to the same
receptor dimers (see Table S1).
NOne of the major differences in the behavior of the two cell
types is the activation of Hsp27: whereas this heat shockprotein becomes activated in response to cytokine stimulation
in primary cells, no significant increase in the state of
phosphorylation occurs in almost all studied scenarios in thecancer cell line (leading to many false ‘‘on’’ predictions).
NAnother remarkable discrepancy between the experimentaldata and our model predictions is the influence of the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin on phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase (see
lines 14/15 in Figures 6 and 7), which is not supported by ourmodel. Although mTOR mediates the phosphorylation of thecatalytic site T389 [45], it has to the best of our knowledge notbeen implicated with the phosphorylation of T421 and S424,
those sites, whose state of phosphorylation were measured in
the analyzed data sets. However, an inhibitory effect ofrapamycin on these sites has been reported earlier [46], even ifthe molecular mechanism that could explain this influence stillhas to be uncovered.
NAccording to our model, PI3K should influence all measuredreadouts except STAT3. However, the data show a clear effectof the PI3K inhibitor only on the phosphorylation of Akt (seeFigure 6, lines 12/13 and Figure 7, lines 50–61). Additionally,
Figure 8 shows that JNK, p38 and, in primary cells also
Hsp27, could be activated in the experiments in presence ofPI3K inhibitor although our model predicted the phosphor-ylation to be blocked (due to the AND connections of thePI3K-dependent nodes PIP3 and PI(3,4)P2, respectively, with
Vav2 and SOS1_Eps8_E3b1). We therefore searched for
hypothetical changes in our model structure that could explainthese experimental findings. We observed that node Rac/Cdc42 lies on all paths connecting the inputs (ligands) with theaforementioned critical readouts (except Gsk3, see below), i.e.
activation of Rac/Cdc42 is necessary in our model for
phosphorylation of JNK, Hsp27 and p38. We may thushypothesize that - in contrast to the assumption in our model -PI3K activity is not necessary for activation of the small G-proteins Rac and Cdc42 in primary hepatocytes and in
HepG2 cells.
NA closer look on Figure 8B (lines 19/20) reveals that the
phosphorylation of JNK in response to neuregulin is – incontrast to the response to any of the other ligands – sensitive
on PI3K inhibitor. This is also reflected in Figure 7 where an
increase of neuregulin only increases the phosphorylation ofJNK in absence of PI3K inhibitor (see lines 28–33) anddecreasing the level of PI3K (i.e. adding the inhibitor) afterneuregulin stimulation also leads to a decreased phosphoryla-
tion state of JNK (see lines 52 and 59). Therefore, neuregulinmust use a different, PI3K dependent signaling path for
activating JNK than the other ligands, probably due to the fact
that neuregulin only activates ErbB1/ErbB3-dimers whereas
EGF, TGF a, amphiregulin and epiregulin additionally
activate ErbB1-homodimers. Taking these findings together,
we propose the following alternative mechanism: Vav2 is the
major GEF for Rac/Cdc42 in hepatocytes and activates Rac/
Cdc42 in a PI3K-independent way. Neuregulin, which cannot
bind to ErbB1-homodimers and accordingly is not able to
activate Vav2 (see Table S1), provokes the activation of JNK
independently of the Rac/Cdc42 induced MAPK cascade
through a different, PI3K-dependent pathway.
NIn the model, the inhibitory phosphorylation of Gsk3 can be
induced by a MEK1/2 dependent pathway (via p90RSK) and
by a PI3K dependent pathway (via Akt). Figures 6 and 7 (lines
9 and 13) show that the phosphorylation of Gsk3 in response to
TGF ais independent of the MEK inhibitor and the PI3K
inhibitor, both in HepG2 and in primary cells. As TGF a
stimulation leads to a strong phosphorylation of Gsk3 in both
cell types (see Figure 8), there must be another signaling route,
not involving MEK and PI3K. One possible candidate is PKC
which has already been reported to inhibit Gsk3, however not
in response to ligands of the EGF family [47].
NAccording to the data, both Gsk3 and p90RSK are influencedby JNK inhibitor after TGF astimulation in primary
hepatocytes (see Figure 6, line 18). This seems to support
another possible mechanism, where JNK activates p90RSKwhich may then phosphorylate Gsk3. However, the JNK
inhibitor affects much more proteins than expected, both in
HepG2 and in primary cells. As these unexpected influences
also occur in absence of ligand stimulation, this strongly
suggests a minor specificity of the JNK inhibitor.
NSimilar as for Gsk3 phosphorylation, data analysis with ourmodel provides useful insights into the activation mechanism
of CREB in response to TGF a: the proposed effect of the p38
dependent kinase MK2 on CREB cannot be observed both in
HepG2 and in primary cells (see Figures 6 and 7, line 11). The
positive effect of MEK on CREB phosphorylation after TGF a
stimulation can be seen in HepG2 (Figure 7, line 9), but not in
primary hepatocytes (Figure 6, line 9). Together with the
finding of the logical analysis that the MEK inhibitor cannot
block activation of CREB in HepG2 (Figure 8), this indicates
that there must be an alternative pathway for CREB activation
in primary hepatocytes that is probably involving p90RSK.
A summary of the above mentioned results is given in Table S3.
Changing the model accordingly, we can improve the agreement
of model predictions and data in the logical analysis from 90% to
97% for the primary cells and from 74% to 94% for HepG2. For
the dependency analysis, the number of comparisons that agree
explicitly increases from 74% to 82% for primary and from 45%
to 64% for HepG2 cells. Moreover, the number of entries where
we assumed a change in the data but could not detect a significant
increase or decrease reduces from 13% to 4% (primary) and from
45% to 24% (HepG2), albeit at the expense of a minor increase in
the number of contradictions (primary: increase from 13% to
14%, HepG2: 10% to 12%).
As described above, herein we deduced the proposed changes of
the model structure manually from the data analysis. More
systematic approaches for network identification from combina-
torial experiments are given in Saez-Rodriguez et al (in
preparation) and in [48].

the logical model description is a great advantage of our approach
and could hardly be achieved with a model relying on differentialequations (where parameter uncertainty often hampers a falsifica-tion of the model structure).
Discussion
In the present work, we developed a large-scale logical model of
signaling through the four ErbB receptors, including the ERK,JNK and p38 MAPK cascades, Akt signaling, activation of STATs
and the PLC cpathway, based on the stoichiometric pathway map
of Oda et al[14]. We discussed technical problems that arise when
converting a stoichiometric model into a logical one and proposeda general guideline how to deal with them.
We examined several properties of the logical model charac-
terizing its topology (feedback loops and network-wide interde-pendencies as derived from the underlying interaction graph) and
its qualitative input-output behavior with respect to different
stimuli. We also introduced the new technique of speciesequivalence classes revealing coupled activation patterns in thelogical model providing valuable insights into the correlatedbehavior of network elements.
One possibility to deal with uncertainties concerning the correct
logical combination of different influences on a certain node is the
usage of gates with incomplete truth tables (ITT gates). We
replaced the (deterministic) logical gates for the activation of 14species of our model with ITT gates and repeated all logicalanalyses with this modified model. Surprisingly, the predictivepower of the ITT model is still high, highlighting the redundant
structure of major parts of the signaling pathway and showing that
many properties of the network do not rely on the assumptions wemade when choosing the logical functions.
Compared with a dynamic model based on differential
equations, our approach for describing signaling events is certainlylimited in reflecting kinetic aspects which are important to obtain acomplete understanding of these processes in the cell. However,
properties derived exclusively from the structure can provide
insights into the transfer of signals in the cell, as the result of thisand other studies have shown [28,29]. The simpler design of thequalitative models also has some advantages over complex
dynamic models. First of all, the logical approach enables us to
model large-scale signaling networks allowing, for example, tostudy the effects of crosstalk, for which a dynamic description iscurrently often unimaginable. An expansion of the model can
easily be done, whereas adding a reaction to a model of differential
equations requires usually the elaborate re-estimation of param-eters. The flexible architecture of the model also enables us to testand generate hypotheses very quickly. Another advantage is that
the qualitative predictions derived with a logical model do not
depend on certain parameter values except the time scales and aretherefore more generally valid. There are also methods to studyODE models without parameters (e.g. [49–51]). However, these
methods are currently limited to relatively small systems and study
different properties.
With the advances of experimental techniques, it becomes more
and more essential to provide tools that allow for the analysis and
exemplification of the huge amount of data that arise. Wedeveloped new techniques for the analysis of large data sets thatare especially well-suited to analyze data that stem from
combinatorial experiments (systematic combination of different
ligands/inhibitors). The first approach, a method for comparingexperimental (high-throughput) data with predictions derived fromthe logical model, requires a discretization of the data. Althoughthe ‘‘on/off’’ decision is sometimes hard to take as no referencedata exist and the ‘‘right’’ thresholds for the parameters are
unknown, assessing the sensitivities of the data with respect to the
discretization thresholds leads to a safer interpretation. Alterna-tively, the data can be assigned a relative value between 0 and 1which can be compared to the discrete (0/1) value of the model
(Saez-Rodriguez et al, in preparation). The second approach, the
comparison of the data with the topological dependency structureof the model (captured in the interaction graph), requires only asignificance threshold and provides an even simpler method forthe falsification of qualitative knowledge as it relies on less
assumptions than the logical model (only the wiring diagram is
evaluated; logical combinations and discrete states are notrequired).
Applying these new automatized techniques to analyze high-
throughput phospho-proteomic data revealed some importantinsights into the structure of EGFR/ErbB signaling in primaryhepatocytes and the HepG2 cell line. Our results strongly suggest a
model where the Rac/Cdc42 induced p38 and JNK cascades are
independent of PI3K, both in primary hepatocytes and in HepG2.Furthermore, we detected that the activation of JNK in responseto neuregulin follows a PI3K-dependent signaling pathway that
seems not to be important for activation of JNK through ErbB1-
binding ligands. Additional findings concern Gsk3 and CREBwhere known signaling paths were excluded to provoke phos-phorylation after TGF astimulation and new routes could be
proposed. Finally, we observed no activation of STAT3 in both
cell types and no activation of Hsp27 in HepG2. Besides theseresults on the topology of EGFR/ErbB signaling in hepatocytes,the comparison of model predictions and data could also detectside effects of the used JNK inhibitor.
With our software CellNetAnalyzer (CNA; [32]) we provide a
powerful tool to study structural networks. It facilitates the analysisof interaction graphs as well as logical models and also provides
methods to compare model predictions with experimental data as
described herein. Furthermore, CNA is now highly coupled with
the tools ProMoT [31], DataRail [42] and CellNetOptimizer (Saez-
Rodriguez et al, in preparation), forming an integrated pipeline for
the construction, structural analysis and data interpretation of
signal transduction networks.
The presented model is to the best of our knowledge one of the
largest existing mathematical models of the EGFR/ErbB signaling
pathway. However, it is far from being complete and has to becomplemented, for example by including the endocytosis of thereceptors. Step by step, we want to expand the model by other
important mitogenic and pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways to
study crosstalk. We also think that the logical model can serve as auseful basis for the development of dynamic models. A stepbetween both modeling frameworks could be to refine the currentbinary description and use multilevel activation instead, a
promising approach yet it requires more detailed (semi-quantita-
tive) information on the reaction kinetics and leads to morecomplex networks. Further refinements could be achieved by fuzzylogic description or by considering more precise time delays for the
interactions.
Methods
Logical modeling of the EGFR/ErbB signaling network
For the reconstruction and qualitative analysis of the EGFR/
ErbB signaling network we employ a logical modeling framework
as introduced previously [30,32]. Signaling networks are usuallystructured into input, intermediate and output layer and the inputsignals govern the response of the network. For this characteristic
network topology we introduced logical interaction hypergraphs (LIHs)The Logic of ErbB Signaling
PLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 15 August 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e1000438
as a special representation of Boolean networks, which is well-
suited to formalize, visualize and analyze logical models of signal
transduction networks. As in all Boolean networks, nodes in thenetwork represent species (e.g. kinases, adaptor molecules or
transcription factors) each having an associated logical state (in the
binary case as used herein only ‘‘on’’ (1) or ‘‘off’’ (0)) determining
whether the species is active (or present) or not. Signaling events
are encoded as Boolean operations on the network nodes. Forexample, the MAP kinase (MAPK) JNK can be activated (gets
‘‘on’’) if the MAPK kinase MKK7 AND the MAPK kinase MKK4
are active (see the AND connection in Figure 1). Usually, a node
can be activated by more than one signaling event; all these events
are then OR-connected, e.g. the MAPK p38 becomes active ifMKK3 OR MKK4 OR MKK6 is active (Figure 1).
In general, in LIHs we make only use of the Boolean operators
AND ( ?), OR ( +), and NOT (!), which are sufficient to represent
any logical relationship. A signaling event (or interaction) in an
LIH is an AND connection of nodes (negation of node values usingthe NOT operator are allowed) describing one opportunity how
the target species of this connection can be activated. Hence, for
the first example described above we would write
MKK7 AND MKK4 ?JNK
or shorter MKK7 :MKK4?JNK
In a graphical representation of the network (see JNK node in
Figure 1), such an AND connection is displayed as a hyperarc .I n
contrast to arcs in graphs, a hyperarc (in hypergraphs) may haveseveral start or end nodes. Clearly, in some cases, only one species
is required to activate another, as in the example
MKK3?p38 :
In these cases, the hyperarc is a simple arc as occurring in graphs; we
will nevertheless refer to it as a hyperarc. As already mentioned, a
species may be activated via several distinct signaling events
(hyperarcs), i.e. all these signaling events are OR-connected. This
can again be illustrated by p38, which can be activated (indepen-dently) via three different MAPKs and we therefore have three
different OR-connected hyperarcs:
MKK3?p38 OR MKK4 ?p38 OR MKK6 ?p38
Hence, all hyperarcs pointing into a species are OR connected. In this
way we can easily interpret Figure 1, which displays graphically theinteractions given in Table S1.
As described in the main part, the reconstruction of our logical
model of EGFR/ErbB is based on a stoichiometric model of EGFreceptor signaling [14] and additional information from the
literature. Some general remarks on how a stoichiometric network
can be translated into a logical one are given in the main part. The
logical model (for both version M1 and version M2; the latter
having 14 gates with incomplete truth tables; see main text)comprises signaling of 13 members of the EGF ligand family
through the EGF receptor and its heterodimerization partners
ErbB2-4, leading to the activation of various transcription factors
and kinases that effect proliferation, growth and survival (Figure 1).
In addition to ligands and receptors, species whose regulation isnot known are herein considered as members of the input layer,
for example the phosphatases PTEN and SHIP2.
The differentiation between ‘‘early’’ and ‘‘late’’ events (see
below and main part) makes it sometimes necessary to introduceauxiliary (‘‘dummy’’) nodes that have no biological correspon-
dents. Consider for example a species C that is activated by speciesA during the early events ( t= 1) and down-regulated by another
species B as a late event ( t= 2). Assuming that both the presence of
A and the absence of B are necessary to activate C, we use anAND connection in the LIH representation (A ?!BRC). As the
two influences are combined to one hyperarc in the LIH, we can
assign only one time variable to this interaction. In order to reflect
the time delay of the inhibitory activity of B, we introduce anadditional dummy node with t= 2. We now describe the original
interaction A ?!BRC with two interactions
B?B
dummy t~2 ðÞ
A:!Bdummy?Ct~1 ðÞ :
An example in the ErbB model are the ErbB1-homodimers that
are activated by various ligands (e.g. EGF) and dephosphorylatedby SHP1 (see Table S1). To properly describe the timing of theSHP1-mediated dephosphorylation of the receptor, we introduce a
dummy species shp1d that is activated by SHP1 and obtain thus
two hyperarcs:
shp1?shp1d t~2 ðÞ
egf :erbb1 :!shp1d?erbb11 t~1 ðÞ :
Another type of node that is introduced for modeling purpose only
is what we refer to as reservoir . It is used whenever a molecule
causes different downstream events depending on how it is
activated. Here, we have to use more than one compound todescribe the molecule in the model. An example in our model is
mTOR: associated with Rictor, it is involved in the activation of
Akt, whereas the Raptor-bound form activates p70S6 kinase.However, as all these compounds represent the same biologicalspecies, we associate them with a reservoir, pointing out that they
share the same pool. Inactivation of the reservoir will then affect
the activation of all correspondents of this species.
A full description of the model M1 with all species and
interactions (hyperarcs) is given in Table S1. In model variant M2,
14 logical gates of model M1 have been configured as incompletetruth tables (ITT gates). The differences between M1 and M2 are
described in Table S2.
Analysis of the logical model
Once an LIH has been set-up, we may start to analyze it. A
typical scenario is that we apply a pattern of inputs to the networkand we would like to know how the nodes in the network willrespond to this stimulation. As explained in [32], by propagating
input signals along the logical (hyperarc) connections (which is
equivalent to computing the logical steady state resulting from theinput stimuli) we obtain the qualitative response of the network.Note that the logical steady state obtained by this propagation
technique is independent of the assumption of synchronous or
asynchronous switching which is required when analyzing thediscrete dynamics of Boolean networks [27]. It depends on thefunctionality of positive or negative feedback loops in the network
whether we can resolve a complete and unique logical response of
all nodes for a given set of input stimuli (for example, negativefeedback loops may prevent the existence of a logical steady state).
Feedback loops are usually present in signaling networks, however,
as described in the main part, we identified one interaction in eachloop that can be considered as a late event ( t= 2). When
considering the initial response of the network we set these late-The Logic of ErbB Signaling
PLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 16 August 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e1000438
event connections inactive leading to an acyclic network for which
always a unique network response for a given set of inputs can be
computed.
One can also easily perform in silico experiments, for example
check how a knock-out (or inhibition) alters the network response
by fixing the state of the respective species.
With the idea of minimal intervention sets (MIS) one may even
directly search for those interventions that enforce a desiredresponse (e.g. activation or inactivation of a transcription factor).
As described in [32], MISs can be computed by testing
systematically which combinations of knockouts and knockins
fulfill a specified intervention goal.
Species equivalence classes in logical networks
A new analysis technique for logical networks is introduced in this
work: we search for equivalence classes of network nodes whose
activation pattern is completely coupled in logical steady state:
species Aand Bare elements of the same equivalence class, if it
either holds that their values in steady state are always the same
(A=0uB=0 , A=1uB= 1; positive coupling) or always the
opposite ( A=0uB=1 , A=1uB= 0; negative coupling) irrespec-
tive of the chosen inputs (e.g. ligands). In other words, the state of
one species in the equivalence class determines the states of all other
species in this class. Again, the relation given above holds for logical
steady states where both A and B are determined and where no
intervention was made in the network except for the inputs.
Whenever a species of a particular equivalence class is active, we
can conclude that all other species of the same equivalence class
must have been activated (deactivated in case of negative
coupling), at least transiently.
An efficient algorithm for computing the equivalence classes can
be constructed as follows:
1) Equivalence classes can be computed for a given scenario, so
we first define a specific (possibly empty) set of fixed states,
typically from (some) input nodes.
2) For this given scenario we test systematically for each species
whether it is strongly coupled with other nodes or not,
independently of external stimuli. For each species Awe
compute (i) the logical steady states of all other species that
result when fixing the state of Ato 1 and (ii) the logical steady
states of all other species that result when fixing the state of A
to 0. A node Bwhose logical steady state can be determined
in both cases and is 1 in one case and 0 in the other case is
known to be in one equivalence class with species A:Bis
positively coupled with Aif the two resulting logical steady
states of Bare 1/0 (it then holds A=1=.B=1 ,
A=0=.B= 0 and thus according to contraposition also
B=0=.A=0 , B=1=.A= 1) and negatively coupled if the
two logical steady states are 0/1 (it then holds A=1=.B=0 ,
A=1=.B= 0 and thus according to contraposition also
B=0=.A=1 , B=1=.A= 0). The case that the logical
steady state of a species Bis 0/0 or 1/1 (for fixing A=1 /
A= 0) indicates that this species Bcan never be activated or
never be inhibited, respectively, and would thus indicate a
semantic problem in the model.
If a species Ais coupled with species B, and species Bis coupled
with species C, we can subsume all three species in one equivalence
class (we do that systematically for all species until we reach finally
the equivalence classes). Composing the equivalence classes in this
way, it may also happen that species that cannot influence each
other (no directed path between both exists) are in one equivalenceclass due to a common upstream regulator. Consider a networkthat only contains the interactions A RB and ARC. Fixing the
state of B or C to 1/0 we cannot conclude any equivalence
relations as no further states can be determined. Fixing A to 1and 0 we find that A is equivalent to B and A is equivalent to C,thus – according to the rule given above – A, B and C form one
equivalence class.
Interaction graph analysis
Another advantage of LIHs is that we can easily derive the
(signed and directed) interaction graph underlying the logicalmodel: we only have to split all hyperarcs that have two or morestart nodes (i.e. the AND connections) into simple arcs. Interaction
graphs cannot be used to give on/off predictions; however, they
provide an appropriate formalism to search for signaling paths andfeedback loops. Another useful feature that can be extracted frominteraction graphs is the dependency matrix as introduced in [30,32]
which displays network-wide interdependencies between all pairs
of species. For example, a species A is an activator (inhibitor) of
another species B, if at least one path leads from A to B and if allthose paths are positive (negative). This kind of information can bevery useful for predicting effects of perturbations.
Model implementation and availability
We set-up the logical EGFR/ErbB model with ProMoT [31] and
exported the mathematical description as well as the graphical
representation to the analysis tool CellNetAnalyzer (CNA) [32]. The
results obtained with CellNetAnalyzer have been partially re-
imported to and visualized in ProMoT (Figures 1, 3, 5). Data
management and discretization was performed with DataRail
[42].

After acceptance, the model will be provided in formats for
ProMoT and CellNetAnalyzer .
Experimental set-up and measurement data
The data on primary human hepatocytes and the first part of
the HepG2 data were obtained from experiments conducted byAlexopoulos et al(in preparation), while for the second part of the
HepG2 data, a cue-signal-response (CSR) compendium was
created for the EGFR pathway. The second dataset comprises11 phosphoprotein measurements under 24 different perturbationsgenerated by the combinatorial co-treatments with a diverse set of
ErbB ligands and the PI3K inhibitor. For ligands we choose 5
ErbB related cytokines, namely epidermal growth factor (EGF),neuregulin 1 (NRG1; also known as heregulin), amphiregulin(AR), epiregulin (EPR), and transforming growth factor alpha
(TGF a). For each stimulus, the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK -474 was
added at 2 mM final concentration 30 minutes prior to any ligand
treatment. Optimal inhibitor concentration was obtained forconcentration-inhibition curve (data not shown) in order to
achieve 95% inhibition of the downstream pAkt signal on TGF a
stimulated HepG2. The dataset was created using a high-throughput method of bead-based fluorescent readings (Luminex,Austin, TX). Assays were optimized for multiplexability andchecked for passage-to-passage and preparation-to-preparation
variability (Alexopoulos et al, in preparation).
The full dataset (first and second part) and the resulting
discretization are graphically depicted in Figure S4.The Logic of ErbB Signaling

†Co-ﬁrst authors of this manuscriptCaveolin-1 (CAV1) is a vital scaffold protein heterogeneously expressed in both healthy and
malignant tissue. We focus on the role of CAV1 when overexpressed in T -cell leukemia.
Previously, we have shown that CAV1 is involved in cell-to-cell communication, cellular
proliferation, and immune synapse formation; however, the molecular mechanisms have
not been elucidated. We hypothesize that the role of CAV1 in immune synapse formation
contributes to immune regulation during leukemic progression, thereby warranting stud-
ies of the role of CAV1 in CD4CT -cells in relation to antigen-presenting cells. To address
this need, we developed a computational model of a CD4Cimmune effector T -cell to
mimic cellular dynamics and molecular signaling under healthy and immunocompromised
conditions (i.e., leukemic conditions). Using the Cell Collective computational modeling
software, the CD4CT -cell model was constructed and simulated under CAV1C/C,CAV1C/ ,
andCAV1 / conditions to produce a hypothetical immune response. This model allowed
us to predict and examine the heterogeneous effects and mechanisms of CAV1 in silico.
Experimental results indicate a signature of molecules involved in cellular proliferation, cell
survival, and cytoskeletal rearrangement that were highly affected by CAV1 knock out.
With this comprehensive model of a CD4CT -cell, we then validated in vivo protein expres-
sion levels. Based on this study, we modeled a CD4CT -cell, manipulated gene expression
in immunocompromised versus competent settings, validated these manipulations in an
in vivo murine model, and corroborated acute T -cell leukemia gene expression proﬁles in
human beings. Moreover, we can model an immunocompetent versus an immunocom-
promised microenvironment to better understand how signaling is regulated in patients
with leukemia.

INTRODUCTION
Caveolae are cave-like invaginations comprised mostly of the pro-
tein caveolin-1 (CA V1). In addition to the traditional roles of
CA V1 in endocytosis, CA V1 has been implicated in processes
ranging from signal transduction (1, 2), to both oncogenesis (3–
5), and tumor suppression (6–8). Recently, three new roles for
CA V1 emerged, including regulating immune synapse formation,
T-cell receptor (TCR) activation, and mediating actin polymer-
ization (9–11). Caveolin-1 knockout studies show an attenuated
immune synapse formation as observed by decreased F-actin stain-
ing and dysregulation of RAC1 and ARP2/3 pathways (9). When
T-cells engage with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), decreased
TCR-dependent T-cell proliferation is observed when CA V1 is pro-
hibited from interacting with CD26 (12). Downstream signaling
pathways affected by CA V1 knockdown include the organization
of the KSR1 mediated Raf/MEK/ERK signal cascade (13) and
ZAP70, p56lck, and TCRz phosphorylation (14). This mechanismhas been shown to be distinct from CD3/CD28 stimulation (15),
where no proliferation defects were observed in Cav1 / T-cells.
CA V1 acts as a scaffolding molecule thereby likely contributing
to diverse events in the cell through CA V1-mediated recruit-
ment of signaling complexes to the plasma membrane. More-
over, T-cell activation through the TCR and competent immune
synapse formation are necessary for a healthy immune response.
Misregulation of these processes can lead to deleterious effects,
including cancer progression and a phenotype known as tumor-
induced immunosuppression (16, 17). As CD4CT-cells are vital
for proper adaptive immune function, and CA V1 plays a role in
immune synapse formation, we chose to further investigate the
CA V1-mediated pathways in a CD4CT-cell.
T o better understand the intricate biology of CA V1 signaling
in CD4CT-cells, the development of a comprehensive in silico
model is warranted. Through such a model, further identiﬁcation
of molecules associated with CA V1 signaling can occur.

Conroy et al. Role of CAV1 in CD4CT-lymphocytes
Importantly, such a model allows for real-time simulations
using computer software in an effort to identify speciﬁc mech-
anisms in the cell. In order to generate such a comprehensive and
dynamic model, a systems biology approach is required (18). This
approach provides a potentially greater understanding of the com-
plex cellular functions that occur in living systems, allowing the
use of computer models to conduct thousands of virtual experi-
ments as well as make methodical predictions regarding proteins
of interest (18–21).
Herein, we describe the construction and validation of a fully
functional in silico CD4CT-cell model using the Cell Collec-
tive, a web-based, open-source dynamic modeling platform that
allows scientists to construct computational models in a non-
mathematical fashion (20, 22). From this in silico starting position,
comprehensive simulations were performed, allowing for predic-
tions and hypotheses to be drawn for further in vitro/in vivo
experimentation. T o our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time a dynamic
model of a CD4CT-cell has been created to observe the down-
stream effects of CA V1C/C(wild type), CA V1C/ (heterozygous),
and CA V1 / (knock down) upon cell signaling and intracel-
lular networks as validated by in silico simulations and in vivo
investigations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
COMPUTATIONAL MODEL CONSTRUCTION WITH CELL COLLECTIVE
The presented model was constructed using Cell Collective –
a collaborative and interactive platform for modeling biologi-
cal/biochemical systems (20, 22). The mathematical framework
behind Cell Collective is based on a common qualitative (discrete)
modeling technique where the regulatory mechanism of each node
is described with a logical function [for more comprehensive infor-
mation on logical modeling, see Ref. (23, 24)]. Cell Collective
allows users to construct and simulate large-scale computational
models of various biological processes based on qualitative inter-
action information extracted from previously published literature.
The initial version of the model was structured after the previously
published models (25, 26). The individual components and local
interactions in the presented ﬁnal model were retrieved manually
from published literature. The model was subsequently validated
against well-known experimentally demonstrated T-cell dynam-
ics (see Model Validation), as well as new experiments presented
in this paper. The Cell Collective’s Knowledge Base was used to
catalog and annotate every interaction and regulatory mechanism
(e.g., tyrosine phosphorylation on Y316) as mined from the pri-
mary literature. The model is freely available for simulations and
further contributions by others directly in the platform. The model
can be also downloaded in the SBML format (24) to be used within
other software tools.
MODEL VALIDATION
The model was constructed using local (e.g., protein–protein inter-
action) information from the primary literature. In other words,
during the construction phase of the model, there was no attempt
to determine the local interactions based on any other larger phe-
notypes or phenomena. However, after the model was completed,
veriﬁcation of the accuracy of the model involved testing it for
the ability to reproduce complex input–output phenomena that
have been observed in the laboratory. T o do this, the T-cell modelwas simulated under a multitude of cellular conditions and ana-
lyzed in terms of input–output dose–response curves to determine
whether the model behaves as expected [ Figure 2 ; Ref. (27–33)],

six separate conditions including wild-type tissue, diseased tissue
(diseases A and B), wild-type blood, and diseased blood (diseases A
and B). Wild-type and diseased blood simulations are not included
due to inconclusive data. Each experimental environment was sim-

and 4, an external species, “CA V1 Activator,” was built into the

MOUSE MAINTENANCE
Animals were housed in pathogen-free animal facilities, and all
experimental protocols were reviewed and approved per the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University
of Nebraska Medical Center/University of Nebraska at Omaha
(IACUC# 13-056-08-EP). C57Bl/6J and B6.Cg-Cav1tm1Mls/J mice
were purchased from the Jack-son Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
ME, USA). Post-natal day 54 ( 5 days) mice were used for all
experiments.
HISTOLOGICAL STAINING
Spleen and lymph node tissues were sectioned and stained at the
University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Tissue Science Facility.
Spleen and lymph node tissues were sectioned, preserved in 10%formalin, and embedded onto slides in parafﬁn. Speciﬁcally, all
tissues were sectioned after at least 48 h in ﬁxative and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin using standard protocol.
For immunohistochemical staining (IHC), tissues were depar-
raﬁnized in xylene for 3 min and rehydrated in decreasing concen-
trations of ethanol (100–50%). Antigen retrieval was performed
by boiling sections in a solution of Sodium Citrate with 0.05%
Tween-20. Blocking against non-speciﬁc binding and endoge-
nous peroxidases was performed by incubation with 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA; Invitrogen) and 0.3% hydrogen perox-
ide, respectively. Primary antibody incubation was conducted for
90 min at room temperature in phosphate buffered saline (PBS;
DIBCO). The following antibodies were used: Rac1 (Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany); CD28 (BD Pharmingen); GATA3 (BD
Pharmingen); CD26 (Abcam); BCL10 (Cell Applications, Inc.).
Horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell
Signaling T echnology; BD Pharmingen; Abcam) were incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were developed with a working
solution 3,3-diaminobenzidine for 10 min at room temperature,
followed by rinsing with distilled water and mounting the coverslip
with Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING
Microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus, accession number GSE55851 (37). Data contained

subtypes: asymptomatic ( nD2), smoldering ( nD2), chronic
(nD1), acute ( nD2), and healthy controls ( nD3). A mini-
mum of two samples were taken from each patient for microar-
ray analyses. Molecules of interest, as established utilizing the
Cell Collective, were selected within the microarray data and
analyzed by fold-change from normal controls between ATL
subtypes. Fold-change values were subjected to uncentered,
average-linkage correlation using Cluster 3.0, and Java Tree-
View as described previously (9). Further, Pearson regression
analyses were conducted to discern correlation among mole-
cules of interest in relation to CA V1 expression across ATL
subtypes.
RESULTS
IN SILICO MODELING OF A CD4CT-CELL
The completed CD4CT-cell model consists of 188 nodes
representing components of various signaling pathways and
corresponding protein-to-protein, protein-phosphorylation, and
kinase interactions ( Figure 1A ). These interactions correlate withpreliminary data generated using Osprey software used to model
CA V1 protein-to-protein interaction types ( Figure 1B ). Each
method of analysis (both the Cell Collective and Osprey) impli-
cates a role for CA V1 in phosphorylation, signal transduction,
transport, and cytoskeletal arrangement. The regulation of these
events by CA V1 is highly complex and dynamic, as illustrated in
Figure 1C .
T o verify that the local interactions built into the model were
able to accurately mimic complex phenomena that have been
produced in the laboratory, 20 validations were conducted via sim-
ulations in Cell Collective (six representative validations are shown
inFigures 2A–F ). As an example, simulated TCR activation by an
APC leads to Erk activation, and the subsequent downstream effect
of cellular proliferation as represented by the literature ( Figure 2A ,
Figure S1 in Supplemental Material).

we observed the protein products most affected by CA V1C/C,
CA V1C/ , and CA V1 / in immounocompetent versus immuno-
compromised conditions ( Figures 3A–C ). In order to test the
validity of the model, we chose to investigate expression levels
of the proteins most affected in the knock down genotype as com-
pared to a wild-type system. Speciﬁcally proteins disregulated by
CA V1 / across all three conditions (WT, Disease A, and Disease
B) included CD26, CARMA1, FYN, SHC1, SOS, SHP2, NOS2A,
BCL10, and GRB2 ( Figure 3C ). Based on ﬁndings from the model
as well as preliminary in vitro data, we hypothesized that CA V1
expression regulates Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1
(RAC1), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10), GATA-binding
protein 3 (GATA3), CD26, and CD28 ( Figures 1C and 3C).
The abovementioned results are indicative of CA V1-mediate
regulation of a variety of cellular functions, notably those that are
downstream of TCR and integrin pathways of which CA V1 serves
as the scaffold. Given these results, we were able to make predic-
tions about protein expression in relation to CA V1 and test them
in the laboratory using in vitro andin vivo experiments. For exam-
ple, we observed that CA V1 is involved in the integrin signaling
pathway that ultimately activates the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) cascade ( Figure 2 ); therefore, we can predict that
cellular proliferation will be decreased if CA V1 is knocked down.
VERIFICATION OF IN SILICO PREDICTIONS IN VIVO
T o determine differences in morphology between CA V1 / and
wild-type mice, we examined tissues (including lymph nodes
and spleen) stained with hematoxylin and eosin and observed
no differences were observed in tissue architecture. Lymphoid
organs (lymph nodes and spleen) were selected for their robust-
ness of CD4CT-cells, and liver was used as a control for tis-
sue histology (i.e., to ensure mice were disease free). Further-
more, immunohistochemistry was utilized to biologically validate
in silico predictions from our CD4CT-cell model.
T op hit proteins: GATA3, RAC1, CD26, and BCL10 were
selected for IHC to validate the model ( Figure 4 ). RAC1 and
GATA3 showed upregulation in the lymph node tissue of the
CA V1 / mice. We observed CD26 and BCL10 to be upregu-
lated in both the lymph node and spleen tissues of the CA V1 / 
mice. We also stained for CD28, as it is a well-characterized co-
stimulatory protein involved in T-cell activation. CD28 showed
no differential expression between the wild-type and CA V1 / 
mice.
Based on predictions from the model ( Figure 3C ), we investi-
gated the differential expression, hierarchal clustering ( Figure 5A ),
and regression analyses ( Figure 5B ) of top hit proteins using
microarray data from ATL cases (GSE55851). Comparison of
ATL subtypes for identiﬁcation of potential molecular signa-
tures in relation to CA V1 expression reveal seven molecules,
including CA V1, clustered together based upon gene expression
proﬁles following hierarchal clustering ( Figure 5A ). We observed
a positive correlation ( RD0.78), with distinct signatures dis-
played between healthy, asymptomatic, smoldering, chronic, and
acute patients ( Figure 5B ). Pearson regression analyses were con-
ducted between each molecule of interest in relation to CA V1
expression across ATL subtypes ( Figure 5B ). Speciﬁcally, we

mice. The corresponding hematoxylin and eosin preparations are included in
the top panel for morphological orientation; all tissues were sectioned
subsequently.

observed strong correlations between CA V1 and the follow-
ing molecules: BCL10 ( RD0.947), DEC2/BHLHB3 ( RD0.782),
SHP2/PTPN11 ( RD0.742), and GATA3 ( RD0.694). Conversely,
SOS1 ( RD  0.981), FYN ( RD  0.949), SOS2 ( RD-0.825), and
CD26 ( RD  0.740) were most negatively correlated to CA V1
expression. These data corroborate those described and simu-
lated in the model ( Figure 3 ); therefore, it is translated to in vivo ,
leukemic conditions.
DISCUSSION
Herein, we present a comprehensive, computational model of a
CD4CT-cell, including CA V1 regulatory pathways. This model
incorporates experimentally validated interactions to posit the role
of CA V1 in healthy CD4Ccells and CD4Ccells in the context
of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (i.e., when the immune response
is skewed). CD4CT-cells are a vital component of the immune
system, as they protect against cancer, infection, and play a role
in autoimmunity. CA V1 has been shown to be upregulated in
numerous types of malignancies. Consequently, we built a CD4C
T-cell model to better understand basic T-cell biology and to
address the role(s) of CA V1 within immunocompetent versus
immunocompromised conditions. Inclusively, we investigated the
role of CA V1 in the regulation of cellular processes, including
cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, actin polymerization, and
immune synapse formation. This model was successfully con-
structed using the Cell Collective platform that allows users to
build cellular models capable of mimicking actual cellular sys-
tems in the laboratory (19–22, 38). The accuracy of the model
was then successfully validated through the comparison of simu-
lations with well-established, global input–output relationshipsas previously observed experimentally. Most importantly, new
in silico predictions were validated in vitro/in vivo using both
murine models and gene expression proﬁles from patients with
a T-cell leukemia due to the previously observed role of Cav1 in
lymphocytes (39–46).
Using Cell Collective, we were able to perform virtual experi-
ments in order to make predictions as to how a CD4CT-cell would
behave when the expression levels of CA V1 were altered and when
CA V1 was knocked down. These experiments provided insight as
to which proteins, and ultimately which cellular functions, might
be regulated by CA V1. Based on in silico results, we observed
that BCL10, CD26, FYN, CARMA1, SHC1, SOS, SHP2, NOS2A,
GRB2, and GATA3 are strongly inﬂuenced by CA V1 expression
(Figure 3C ). Consequently, the expression of these molecules
in vivo was investigated using cluster analyses of microarray data to
measure gene expression ( Figure 5 ). Finally, four key proteins were
selected for further veriﬁcation of the predictions of the model
using immunohistochemistry on mouse tissue with and without
Cav1 (Figure 4 ).
In addition to the four key proteins, CD28 was chosen because
it is known to regulate T-cell activation independent of CA V1
expression (15). RAC1 and GATA3 expression were upregulated
in the lymph node tissue of the CA V1 / mice. These results were
expected based on studies showing the role of CA V1 in lymphoid
tissue (9). We observed both CD26 and BCL10 upregulation, espe-
cially in the germinal centers of the lymph node and spleen tissue
of the CA V1 / mice. These validations of the in silico predictions
show that the CD4CT-cell model is biologically relevant. These
validations of the in silico predictions show that the CD4CT-cell
model is biologically relevant. Therefore, we suggest that based on

Background: The FA/BRCA pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks. Mutations in
this pathway cause Fanconi anemia (FA), a chromosome instability syndrome with bone
marrow failure and cancer predisposition. Upon DNA damage, normal and FA cells
inhibit the cell cycle progression, until the G2/M checkpoint is turned off by the checkpoint
recovery, which becomes activated when the DNA damage has been repaired.
Interestingly, highly damaged FA cells seem to override the G2/M checkpoint. In this
study we explored with a Boolean network model and key experiments whether
checkpoint recovery activation occurs in FA cells with extensive unrepaired DNA damage.
Methods: We performed synchronous/asynchronous simulations of the FA/BRCA
pathway Boolean network model. FA-A and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines were used
to study checkpoint and checkpoint recovery activation after DNA damage induction.
The experimental approach included flow cytometry cell cycle analysis, cell division
tracking, chromosome aberration analysis and gene expression analysis through qRT-PCR
and western blot.
Results: Computational simulations suggested that in FA mutants checkpoint recovery
activity inhibits the checkpoint components despite unrepaired DNA damage, a
behavior that we did not observed in wild-type simulations. This result implies that FA
cells would eventually reenter the cell cycle after a DNA damage induced G2/M
checkpoint arrest, but before the damage has been fixed. We observed that FA-A cells
activate the G2/M checkpoint and arrest in G2 phase, but eventually reach mitosis and
divide with unrepaired DNA damage, thus resolving the initial checkpoint arrest. Based
on our model result we look for ectopic activity of checkpoint recovery components.
We found that checkpoint recovery components, such as PLK1, are expressed to a
similar extent as normal undamaged cells do, even though FA-A cells harbor highly
damaged DNA.
Conclusions: Our results show that FA cells, despite extensive DNA damage, do not
loss the capacity to express the transcriptional and protein components of checkpoint
recovery that might eventually allow their division with unrepaired DNA damage. This
might allow cell survival but increases the genomic instability inherent to FA
individuals and promotes cancer.

Introduction
The molecular basis of the DNA damage response (DDR) has been largely elucidated
through the study of the rare chromosome instability syndromes (CIS) [1] which are
cytogenetically characterized by the spontaneous appearance of chromosome aberrations
(CA) as well as hypersensitivity to specific DNA damaging agents [2–4]. The best-known
CIS include Bloom syndrome (BS) which appears due to mutations in BLM helicase [5, 6]
and results in increased sister chromatid exchanges [7], Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) that
shows particular clonal chromosome rearrangements as a consequence of mutations in
the checkpoint kinase ATM gene[8–11], and Fanconi anemia (FA) [12] whose phenotype
results from mutations in any of the genes that conform the FA/BRCA pathway [13–19]
and consists of chromatidic breaks, iso-chromatidic breaks and radial exchange figures
among chromosomes. Even if these breaks and radials are predominantly seen in FA, they
can also be observed in BS and AT [4, 20]. Although patients affected by CIS display phe-
notypic similarities, such as growth defects, compromised immunological system and an
increased risk to develop cancer [1, 20], each syndrome presents particular phenotypes
and pivotal data. Namely, BS shows sun sensitivity [5], AT presents progressive cerebel-
lar ataxia and oculo-cutaneous telangiectases [8], while FA is characterized by congenital
malformations and progressive bone marrow failure [21]. The products of these genes
interact in the cell’s DNA damage response [1], and thus the deficiency of any of these
proteins diminishes the efficiency of a cell to cope with DNA damage, leading to their
accumulation.
Given the critical role that these proteins have in the protection of the human genome,
certain authors have speculated that survival of CIS patients is an oddity and that
cells escaping apoptotic death do so by constitutively inducing alternative replication or
DNA damage tolerance pathways, which might contribute to the characteristic mutator
phenotypes observed in the CIS [22].
In the particular case of FA, cells are hypersensitive to agents that create DNA inter-
strand crosslinks (ICL), such as mitomycin C (MMC) or diepoxybutane (DEB) [21]. The
treatment of FA cells with MMC or DEB induces a blockage during the G2 phase of
the cell cycle and exacerbates the frequency of CAs, including double strand breaks
(DSBs) and radial exchange figures [23]. Biallelic mutations in at least one of 18 distinct
FANC genes can generate FA. The products of these genes interact in the so-called Fan-
coni Anemia/Breast Cancer (FA/BRCA) pathway [13–18], involved in the repair of the
DNA damage generated by intrinsic acetaldehydes and extrinsic ICL inducing agents.
Therefore, a deficiency in this pathway results in DNA damage accumulation that might
originate congenital malformations, uncontrolled hematopoietic cell death and cancer in
FA patients [24–27].
Over the years, the FA diagnosis assays and experimental approaches have shown that
a great proportion of FA cells succumb to DNA damage due to their inherent repair defi-
ciencies. However, some cells are able to tolerate high levels of DNA damage and progress
into mitosis despite a great amount of CAs. The mechanisms that allow the cells with
CAs to omit the DNA damage integrity checkpoints remain uncertain because the more
obvious candidate, the G2/M checkpoint, is considered to be properly activated in FA
cells [28–30]. Thus, the idea of a malfunctioning checkpoint in FA cells has been ruled
out and it is presumed that some other mechanisms are responsible for the checkpoint
override in FA cells with unrepaired DSBs.
Rodríguez et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling  (2015) 12:19 
In recent times, an attenuated G2 checkpoint phenotype, characterized by low levels
of CHK1 (NP_001107594.1) and p53 (NP_000537.3), absence of the G2 phase arrest, and
arrival to metaphase with a large number of MMC-induced CAs has been described
in cells from adult FA individuals [31]. It has been suggested that the G2 checkpoint
attenuation could be an important contributor for the increased life expectancy of these
FA patients, and that the release of cells with unrepaired DSBs could promote neoplas-
tic transformation [31]. Nevertheless, since non-attenuated FA cells carrying unrepaired
DNA damage achieve a correct G2/M checkpoint activation [28–30], the aforementioned
mechanism seems to be a particular scenario rather than a general mechanism to enable
the resolution of the G2 checkpoint blockage.
Network modeling has been previously used with success to study the dynamics of
biological systems [32–37]. Particularly, we developed a Boolean network model (BNM)
for the FA/BRCA pathway [38], in which we observed that the inclusion of the check-
point recovery (CHKREC) node is crucial for the network correct function. In our model,
the CHKREC node represents the process that relieves the inhibition of the checkpoint
machinery over the mitosis-promoting factor (Cyclin B/CDK1) after a complete DNA
damage repair to allow further cell division [39–42]. This node comprises the G2 tran-
scriptional program that activates the expression of genes driving the G2/M transition
and the protein program that inactivates the γH2AX histone (NP_002096.1) and check-
point kinases [43]. We presumed that CHKREC activation might be releasing cells with
unrepaired DNA damage in FA mutants. To test this possibility, as well as to validate

of our previously published FA/BRCA pathway BNM and experimentally determined if
CHKREC components become activated in FA cells during G2/M during MMC-induced
arrest.
Materials and methods
Model and simulations
The simplification of the FA/BRCA network was done by reorganizing the existing 28
nodes and 122 interactions [38], resulting in a deterministic BNM with 15 nodes and 66
interactions (Fig.1 and Table 1) that vastly simplifies the computational analysis while
maintaining the qualitative dynamical behavior of the original FA/BRCA network. The
simplification was made by collapsing the network components that share functions or
belong to a single pathway into one single node. We were careful to preserve all the impor-
tant functional categories of the network and made sure to recover the behavior of the
wild type and mutant networks. The modifications and simplification criteria are listed in
Table 2.
Simulations were performed for the wild type and all possible gain of function or null
mutants of the model with synchronous and asynchronous update regimes. Here we
report the simulations exploring checkpoint and CHKREC function in wild type and FA
core mutants. These null mutants were simulated fixing to zero the node of interest.
In these mutants we simulated the response to ICLs, whose presence is dependent on
the time that the system requires to turn it off. With our model we simulated two biolog-
ically relevant conditions, a short exposure to ICLs, which is supposed to be repaired fast
and efficiently by the FA/BRCA pathway (Fig. 2b) and a persistent exposure to damaging
agents, which is more difficult to face given the accumulation of damage and saturation

Background: Gonadal sex determination (GSD) in humans is a complex biological
process that takes place in early stages of embryonic development when the
bipotential gonadal primordium (BGP) differentiates towards testes or ovaries. This
decision is directed by one of two distinct pathways embedded in a GSD network
activated in a population of coelomic epithelial cells, the Sertoli progenitor cells (SPC)
and the granulosa progenitor cells (GPC). In males, the pathway is activated when the
Sex-Determining Region Y ( SRY) gene starts to be expressed, whereas in females the
WNT4/ β-catenin pathway promotes the differentiation of the GPCs towards ovaries.
The interactions and dynamics of the elements that constitute the GSD network are
poorly understood, thus our group is interested in inferring the general architecture of
this network as well as modeling the dynamic behavior of a set of genes associated to
this process under wild-type and mutant conditions.
Methods: We reconstructed the regulatory network of GSD with a set of genes
directly associated with the process of differentiation from SPC and GPC towards Sertoli
and granulosa cells, respectively. These genes are experimentally well-characterized
and the effects of their deficiency have been clinically reported. We modeled this GSD
network as a synchronous Boolean network model (BNM) and characterized its
attractors under wild-type and mutant conditions.
Results: Three attractors with a clear biological meaning were found; one of them
corresponding to the currently known gene expression pattern of Sertoli cells, the
second correlating to the granulosa cells and, the third resembling a disgenetic gonad.
Conclusions: The BNM of GSD that we present summarizes the experimental data on
the pathways for Sertoli and granulosa establishment and sheds light on the overall
behavior of a population of cells that differentiate within the developing gonad. With
this model we propose a set of regulatory interactions needed to activate either the SRY
or the WNT4/ β-catenin pathway as well as their downstream targets, which are critical
for further sex differentiation. In addition, we observed a pattern of altered regulatory
interactions and their dynamics that lead to some disorders of sex development (DSD).

Background
Sex development is a complex biological process that occurs during the embryonic and
fetal stages of an individual. For a better understanding sex development is divided
into three consecutive steps: 1) chromosomal sex determination (CSD); 2) gonadal
sex determination (GSD); and 3) phenotypic sex differentiation (PSD). CSD is estab-
lished at conception when the complement of sex chromosomes, XX or XY, is received.
GSD, which is the process that we analyze in this study, refers to the set of genes
and their regulatory interactions that trigger the development toward testes or ovaries,
underlined by a gene regulatory network [1–4]. Finally, PSD involves the development
of the female and male internal and external genitalia in response to the hormones
secreted by the ovaries and testes. Both male and female PSD occur in two tempo-
ral phases, the first occurs within the fetus after GSD and the second occurs during
puberty [5, 6].
GSD occurs within a heterogeneously composed structure called bipotential gonadal
primordium (BGP). This structure, located on the ventromedial surface of the
mesonephros [5–7], is critical for sex development since it can differentiate either as
testes or ovaries [8]. The BGP originates the actual gonad that is composed by a)the
germinal cells (GCs), b)the steroidogenic somatic cells, such as the theca cells in ovary
and the Leydig cells in testis that produce stradiol and testosterone, respectively; and
c)the support somatic cells, including granulosa cells in ovary and Sertoli cells in
testis.
Sertoli and granulosa cells originate from a common population of coelomic epithelial
cells corresponding to the Sertoli progenitor cells (SPC) or granulosa progenitor cells
(GPC) that migrate towards the BGP [9, 10]. In males, the SPCs start to differentiate
toward Sertoli cells after 44 days of development (Carnegie-Stage 18). The mechanism
involves activation of the expression of the Sex-determining Region Y gene ( SRY)t h a t
codifies the SRY transcription factor [9, 11]. SRY associates with other transcription fac-
tors (i.e., CBX2, SF1) to regulate expression of the SOX9 gene that positively regulates the
expression of genes associated to Sertoli cells (i.e., SOX9, FGF9, PGD2, DHH, AMH )[ 2 ] .
In females, where SRY is absent, GSD initiates after 49 days of development (Carnegie-
Stage 20). In this case, the GPCs of coelomic origin differentiate towards granulosa cells
by the action of a distinct gene regulatory pathway. Most likely, an increased amount of
the transcription factor β-catenin up-regulates a set of downstream genes associated to
granulosa, such as FOXL2 andRSPO1 [2, 12, 13]. Thus, the mechanism underlying GSD
involves a common population of undifferentiated cells with the potential to diverge into
two cell fates. The male pathway leads towards Sertoli cell fate determination and dif-
ferentiation, whereas the female pathway leads to granulosa cell fate determination and
differentiation.
Once differentiated, the Sertoli cells act as organizing centers, enclosing GCs to form
testicular cords and secreting factors such as DHH and PDGF, which are essential for
development of the fetal population of Leydig cells [14]. Granulosa cells are the female
equivalent of the Sertoli cells, as they enclose GCs and secrete factors necessary for
oocyte growth and maturation. The regulatory network controlling GSD and differentia-
tion toward Sertoli or granulosa cell consists, in a broad sense, of multiple target genes,
different types of RNAs, transcription factors, nuclear receptors and signaling molecules.
These elements are present in undifferentiated cells and interact in a concerted way either
Ríos et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling  (2015) 12:26 
activating or repressing target genes at the time of GSD to balance the fate toward Sertoli
or granulosa cells [15–17].
The total number of genes implicated in the regulatory network of GSD of humans
and mammals remains elusive, as well as their complete regulatory interactions and their
effects on the process of Sertoli or granulosa cells differentiation. However, it is well
known that mutations in their components underlay the so-called disorders of sex devel-
opment (DSD), a series of genetic conditions characterized by anomalies in gonads as
well as in internal and external genitalia. The incidence of DSDs, as estimated by the
The Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society (LWPES) and the European Society for
Pediatric Endocrinology (ESPE), is 1 in 4,500 births [18] and can be attributed to muta-
tions in various genes of the GSD network. For example, mutations in CBX2 ,GATA4 and
WT1 genes result in a wide range of phenotypic alterations characterized by ambiguous
or female external genitalia with the presence or absence of Mullerian structures in 46,XY
DSDs patients [19]. In contrast, 46,XX DSDs cause masculinization of the female fetus
(normal males with no ovarian tissue) [20]. In other cases 46,XX DSD patients have a
female phenotype but fail to develop ovaries, presenting instead a “streak gonad”? (streaks
of connective fibrous tissue) [21].
Boolean network models (BNM) are formal tools for analyzing the structure and
dynamic behavior of genetic regulatory networks. BNM are best suited for describing
poorly-characterized systems with no or few kinetic details, such as the GSD network.
These models represent molecular entities (genes, transcription factors and RNAs) as
nodes interacting among them within a network. Each node can have only two qualitative

tration or activity, which is insufficient to initiate the intended process or regulation,
while the ON state is equivalent to an above-threshold concentration or activity [22]. The
ON/OFF state of a node within the network is determined by a Boolean function that
encompasses the known regulatory elements of the target node (transcription factors,
nuclear receptors, signaling molecules). The state of these regulatory elements is updated
over consecutive time steps of a simulation until the system converges to either a steady
state or a cycle. BNMs describe the dynamic state of the nodes in a network by updating
the state of the nodes according with the set of regulatory functions [23]. BNMs have been
implemented for the analysis of developmental programs such as flower morphogenesis
inA. thaliana [24], early cardiac development in mice [25], and expression pattern of the
segment polarity genes in Drosophila [26] to name a few.
Despite the relatively high incidence of DSDs, their molecular basis at the level of the
regulatory network remain poorly understood. Thus, we are interested in constructing
a BNM of the process of gonadal sex determination with an emphasis on the regulatory
elements that are present at early stages of development and control the differentiation of

Abstract
Background: Oxidative stress is a consequence of normal and abnormal cellular metabolism and is linked to the
development of human diseases. The effective functioning of the pathway responding to oxidative stress protects
the cellular DNA against oxidative damage; conversely the failure of the oxidative stress response mechanism can
induce aberrant cellular behavior leading to diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Thus,
understanding the normal signaling present in oxidative stress response pathways and determining possiblesignaling alterations leading to disease could provide us with useful pointers for therapeutic purposes. Usingknowledge of oxidative stress response pathways from the literature, we developed a Boolean network model whosesimulated behavior is consistent with earlier experimental observations from the literature. Concatenating theoxidative stress response pathways with the PI3-Kinase-Akt pathway, the oxidative stress is linked to the phenotype of
apoptosis, once again through a Boolean network model. Furthermore, we present an approach for pinpointingpossible fault locations by using temporal variations in the oxidative stress input and observing the resulting
deviations in the apoptotic signature from the normally predicted pathway. Such an approach could potentially form
the basis for designing more effective combination therapies against complex diseases such as cancer.
Results: In this paper, we have developed a Boolean network model for the oxidative stress response. This model was
developed based on pathway information from the current literature pertaining to oxidative stress. Where applicable,
the behaviour predicted by the model is in agreement with experimental observations from the published literature.We have also linked the oxidative stress response to the phenomenon of apoptosis via the PI3k/Akt pathway.
Conclusions: It is our hope that some of the additional predictions here, such as those pertaining to the
oscillatory behaviour of certain genes in the presence of oxidative stress, will be experimentally validated in thenear future. Of course, it should be pointed out that the theoretical procedure presented here for pinpointing faultlocations in a biological network with feedback will need to be further simplified before it can be even consideredfor practical biological validation.
Introduction
The control of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms is
achieved via multivariate interactions between different
biological molecules such as proteins and DNA [1].Consequently, in recent years, various genetic regulatorynetwork modeling approaches such as differential equa-tions and their discrete-time counterparts, Bayesiannetworks, Boolean networks (BNs) and their probabilisticgeneralizations, the so-called probabilistic Booleannetworks (PBNs) [2] have been proposed for capturing theholistic behavior of the relevant genes. Some of theseapproaches such as different ial equations involve finer
models and require a lot of data for inference while otherssuch as Boolean networks yield coarse models with lower
data requirements for model inference. On the other
hand, historically biologists have focused on experimen-
tally establishing marginal cause-effect relationshipsbetween different pairs of genes, which when concatenated

together leads to what is known as pathway information.
Biological pathways are used by biologists to represent
complex interactions occurring at the molecular levelinside living cells [3]. Pathway diagrams describe how thebiological molecules interact to achieve their biologicalfunction in the presence of appropriate stimuli [4]. At a
very simple level, biological pathways represent the graphi-
cal interactions between different molecules. However, asalready noted, the pathways give only a marginal pictureof the regulations (up-regulation or down-regulation) ofthe different genes/RNAs/proteins by other genes/RNAs/proteins.
The complexity of biological signaling and the preve-
lance of prior information in the form of pathway knowl-
edge demand that genetic regulatory network models
consistent with pathway information be developed.Motivated by this, we developed an approach to generateBoolean network models consistent with given pathwayinformation and applied it to studying the p53-mediatedDNA damage stress response [5]. In addition, we used asignaling diagram of the MAP-Kinase pathways to predict
possible location(s) of the single signaling breakdowns,
based on the cancer-causing breakdown signature [6].
Moreover, we also made theoretical predictions of the effi-
cacy of different combination therapies involving six anti-cancer drugs, which we plan to validate in the near future.
In this paper, we first develop a Boolean network model
consistent with oxidative stress response pathway informa-tion from the biological literature. Thereafter this model islinked with the PI3k/Akt p a t h w a ya n dt h ec o m p o s i t e
model is used to pinpoint the possible fault locationsbased on the observed deviations in the apoptotic signa-ture over different time windows. The paper is organizedas follows. Section contains a brief general description ofStress Response Pathways while Section presents a discus-sion specific to the case of oxidative stress. The Booleannetwork model for oxidative stress response is developedin Section. The role of mitochondria as the site in a cell
where the oxidative stress is generated is discussed in Sec-
tion. In Section, we develop an integrated network linkingoxidative stress response to the phenomenon of apoptosisvia the PI3k/Akt pathways. Section presents an approach
for pinpointing fault locations in the integrated networkby observing the apoptotic signature in response to certaintest stress input sequences. Finally, Section contains someconcluding remarks.
Stress response pathways
Adaptive stress response pathways are the first respondersto chemical toxicity, radiati on, and physical insults. The
different stress response pa thways share a very similar
architecture. This architecture has three main compo-nents: a transducer, a sensor and a transcription factor(TF) [7]. The transcription factor (TF) is a DNA-bindingprotein that interacts with the promoter regions of itstarget genes via its canonical DNA-binding sites, known as‘response elements ’(REs), to activate the expression of the
target genes. The sensor is a protein that physically inter-acts with the transcription factor in the cytosol, sequester-ing the transcription factor from the nucleus under
normal cellular conditions. In addition to its role in cyto-
plasmic sequestration of the TF, the sensor may direct TFdegradation, providing an a dditional layer of regulatory
control. The result of the se nsor-TF complexation is to
maintain inactivity of the TF under normal cellular condi-tions, while providing a mechanism that permits activationin response to an appropriate insult to the cell. The trans-ducer is an enzymatic protein, such as a kinase, that con-
veys a biochemical change from a signaling pathway
upstream of the sensor/TF complex in the event of cellularstress. The transducer may directly modify the transcrip-tion factor, providing the activating signal or modify thesensor which in turn, destabilizes the sensor/TF complex.Liberated, stabilized, and activated, the transcription factorrelocates to the nucleus where it activates its target genes.Generally the sensor and TF are unique for a given stress
response pathway unlike transducers which can be shared
between different stress resp onse pathways, leading to
what is commonly referred to as ‘crosstalk ’between the
pathways. A schematic diagram showing the general archi-tecture of a stress response pathway is shown in Figure 1.
Oxidative stress response pathways
Oxidative stress is caused by exposure to reactive oxygen
intermediaries/species ( ROS). The stress induced on the
cells by electrophiles and oxidants gives rise to a variety of
chronic diseases. The outcome of interactions between thecell and oxidants is determined largely by the balancebetween the enzymes that activate the reactive intermedi-aries and the enzymes that detoxify these reactive interme-diaries [8]. For example, oxidative stress contributes toaging and age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascu-
lar disease, chronic inflammation, and neurodegenerative
disorders. The body has developed a variety of counterac-tive measures for combating oxidative stress. At elevatedconcentrations of electrophiles the complex Keap1-Nrf 2
(made up of the transcription factor Nrf2a n ds e n s o r
Keap 1) is broken and Nrf2 is liberated and transported
into the nucleus. Keap 1 has been known to sequester Nrf2
in the cytoplasm and also leads to the proteasomal degra-
dation of Nrf2. Once the complex is broken, Nrf2i sp h o s -
phorylated and transported to the nucleus. Inside the
nucleus, Nrf2 forms heterodimers with small Maf proteins
(SMP ) which then binds to the anti-oxidant response
element ( ARE) and leads to the translation of antioxidant
genes, which produces Phase II detoxifying enzymes.The purpose of this is to detoxify the electrophiles towater soluble components. Thus in response to elevatedSridharan et al.BMC Genomics 2012, 13(Suppl 6):S4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/S6/S4
concentrations of electrophiles, various antioxidant pro-
teins are activated [9-13]. The schematic diagram for Nrf2
activation is shown in Figure 2. In the rest of this paper,the term ARE will be interchangeably used to represent
either the antioxidant response element cis enhancer
sequence that is upstream of the gene promoters for theantioxidant proteins or the antioxidant genes/proteinsthemselves. The context will make it clear whether we arereferring to the regulatory sequence or to the resultinggene/protein.
We next focus on the procedure by which Nrf2i s
deactivated. This is carried out by other proteins thatstop translation of the antioxidant genes once the elec-trophiles have been neutralized. For instance, theBach 1-SMP complex has been known to bind to the
same region on the ARE as the Nrf2-SMP complex.
Similarly, small Maf proteins are known to form homo-dimers or heterodimers with other small Maf proteins.These protein complexes are known to bind to the samelocation on the ARE as the Nrf2-SMP complex. So, once
the electrophiles have been eliminated, these proteincomplexes bind to the ARE and displace Nrf2w h i c h
is then transported back to the cytoplasm. In thecytoplasm, it binds with Keap 1, which directs its

proteosomal degradation [14-17]. The schematic dia-
gram for Nrf2 deactivation is shown in Figure 3.
One of the byproducts of normal metabolism is the
production of a large number of free radicals. Oxidativestress is caused by the production of free radicals in quanti-ties beyond those that can be handled by the cellular
antioxidant system. Indeed, oxidative stress has been impli-
cated in the development of many age-related diseases,including neurodegenerative ones, such as Alzheimer ’sa n d
Parkinson ’s, and in aging itself. In addition, excess free
radicals react with the nucleotides in the DNA resultingin mutations in the long run. Although there are cellularmechanisms to sense and repair the oxidative DNAdamage, mutations can accumulate over a period of time
and result in a major disease like cancer. In the next
section, we develop a Boolean network model for oxidativestress response pathways. This network will be later utilizedto analyze different failure modes that can supress apopto-sis and possibly lead to cancer.Boolean network modeling of oxidative stress response
pathways
Before proceeding to the actual modeling of the specific
oxidative stress response pathways, we first formallydefine the general terms ‘pathway’ and ‘Boolean Network ’
following the detailed development in [5]. Given twogenes/proteins AandBand binary values a,bÎ{0, 1},
we define the term pathway segment
At:a,b→Bto mean that
if gene/protein Aassumes the value athen gene/protein
Btransitions to bin no more than tsubsequent time
steps. A pathway is defined to be a sequence of pathway
segments of the formAt1:a,b→Bt2:b,c→C.
ABoolean Network (BN),ϒ=(V,F), on ngenes is
defined by a set of nodes/genes V={x1, ...,xn},xiÎ{0, 1},
i=1 ,. . . , n,a n dal i s t F=(f1, ...,fn), of Boolean functions,
fi:{ 0 ,1 }n®{0, 1}, i= 1, ..., n[18]. The expression of each
gene is quantized to two levels, and each node xirepre-
sents the state/expression of the gene i,w h e r e xi=0
means that gene iis OFF and xi= 1 means that gene iis

ON. The function fiis called the predictor function for
gene i. Updating the states of all genes in ϒis done syn-
chronously at every time step according to their predictor
functions. At time t, the network state is given by x(t)=
(x1(t),x2(t), ...,xn(t)), which is also called the gene activity
profile (GAP ) of the network.
The modeling approach that we will follow here
involves using the biological pathway knowledge fromthe literature and applying Karnaugh map reductiontechniques to it to obtain an update equation for eachnode of the Boolean network [5]. The details specific tothe oxidative stress response pathway are discussednext. The pathway segments relevant to the oxidativestress response are given below [9,10,12,15,19,20]:

ARE1:1,1→SMP (10)
ARE1:1,0→ROS(11)
ARE1:1,0→PKC (12)
In these pathways ARE represents the family of antioxi-
dant genes in the sense that if the correct complexes bindtoARE it leads to the up-regulation/down-regulation of
the appropriate antioxidant gene. These pathway interac-tions are pictorially represented in Figure 4. In this figurewe have used square boxes without making any distinctionbetween whether they represent proteins/genes or a bio-chemical entity. ROS stands for reactive oxidative species
which is a biochemical entity. The other entities like PKC,
Keap 1,Nrf2,Bach 1 are all proteins and ARE (AntioxidantResponse Element) is a cis enhancer sequence that isupstream of the gene promoters for the antioxidant pro-teins or the antioxidant genes /proteins themselves. Also
the merged activation ( Nrf2/SMP ) or inhibition ( Bach 1/
SMP ) corresponds to dimers formed between these com-
ponents. The Karnaugh-maps for the genes/proteins are
shown in Figure 5.
From the pathways described above and using the
Karnaugh-map reduction techniques, the Boolean update
equations for each node of the network are deduced.Some logical reasoning has been used for determining theequations: 1) the maximum number of predictors forupdating a variable is fixed to be 3; 2) Small Maf Protein isassumed to be ubiquitously expressed and the pathway
given by Eqn.(10) only increases the concentration of
SMP , which in conjunction with Eqn.(9), binds to ARE
and down-regulates the antioxidant gene; 3) a gene beingturned on implies that the corresponding protein is beingproduced although, in reality, this is not necessarily true;and 4) in the case of a conflict in the Karnaugh map, bio-logical knowledge has been used to assign either a 0 or a1. This last point is demonstrated by a specific example.
For instance, in the case of ARE, the entry shown with a
grey circle around it says that when both Bach 1 and Nrf2
are upregulated and antioxidant gene is downregulated,
then at the next time step antioxidant gene will be upregu-lated. The biological explanation for such an update is thatit corresponds to the situation where, in the presence ofStress ,Nrf2 has been activated and is relocating to the
nucleus while the inhibitor Bach 1 is simultaneously relo-
cating to the cytoplasm prior to the activation of antioxi-dant gene at the next time step. Such intuitive reasoninghas been used to model the system here. One might use adifferent reasoning which could lead to a different set ofupdate equations. However, since we are concerned onlyabout the final steady-state behavior, such reasoning canbe justified as long as the overall system behavior, definedby the update equations, matches the steady-state. As an
example, the final update equation for ARE is derived as
follows. In the K-maps, the ones are grouped up in pairs
of 2,4,8 and so on and each group should have at least onevariable staying constant. So for this case there are twogroups whose equations correspond to
Nrf2·(
ARE )and
Nrf2·(
Bach 1). The final update equation for ARE is the
sum of these two equations. Please refer to Additional file1 for some additional details. Indeed, by working with dif-
ferent sets of update equations, we determined that all bio-
logically plausible ones led to the same/similar attractor
behavior. From the set of possible Boolean networks wechose the ones that appealed most to our biological under-standing and the resulting update equations are givenbelow:

shown in Figures 7 and 8 respectively. In these transitiondiagrams, the genes in the binary state representation areordered as [ ROS Keap 1PKC Nrf 2Bach 1ARE ]a n dt h e
binary states are compactly represented by their decimalequivalents. For instance, the binary state (111100) wouldbe represented by the decimal number 60. The states ofparticular interest are the attractors as they give rise tothe steady-state properties of the network. In Figure 7,the state of interest is the singleton attractor 18(010010).On the other hand, in Figure 8, the states of interest arethe seven states forming the attractor cycle. These statesare: 18(010010), 50(110010), 40(101000), 44(101100),45(001101), 5(000101) and 23(010111) traversed in thatorder. They would lead to cyclical/oscillatory behavior inthe time domain response.
It is clear from the preceding discussion that some kind
of oscillatory behavior of the genes will be observed whenthe external Stress input equals 1. On the other hand,
when the Stress input equals 0, the system will rest in only
one state meaning that there will be no oscillation.
Time domain simulation results
The network obtained was simulated using MATLAB by
giving an external stress input signal for a duration of 50
timesteps , and both the input signal and the responses are
shown in Figure 9. The signal ROS is a biological manifes-
tation of the external input signal, Stress being applied to
the network. The biological purpose of this network is tocounteract the effect of ROS produced in response to the
Stress input. As we can see from Figure 9, in the absence

are oscillations as theoretically expected from the exis-
tence of an attractor cycle. In Reichard et al. [14], the cellswere treated with Arsenite, a well known activator of Nrf2

NQO1 which is a known anti-oxidant response element.
Such an in-phase relationship between Nrf2 and the anti-
oxidant gene is also seen in Figure 9. Thus the theoretical
predictions made by our Boolean network model for oxi-dative stress response appear to be consistent with experi-mental observations from the published literature. Note,however, that these experiments consider only two genes/proteins at a time and therefore, there is a need for experi-mentally studying the sim ultaneous activities of ROS ,

Mitochondria and free radical generation
Mitochondria play an important role in cellular energymetabolism, free radical generation and apoptosis. It haslong been suspected that mitochondrial functions con-tribute to the development and progression of cancer[21-23]. Over 70 years ago, Otto Warburg proposed that
a key event in carcinogenesis is a defect in the respira-
tory mechanism, leading to increased glycolysis even int h ep r e s e n c eo fo x y g e n ; t h i si sk n o w na st h eW a r b u r geffect [24]. The well known function of mitochondria isto generate Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP ) molecules
providing energy for the survival of the cell through oxi-dative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ), which is collectively
accomplished by proteins encoded both by nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA. Oxida tive phosphorylation is ametabolic process, which takes place in mitochondria in
which ATP is formed as a result of the transfer of elec-
trons from NADH orFADH
2toO2by a series of elec-
tron carriers. OXPHOS is the major source of ATP as
well as free radical generation in aerobic organisms. Forexample, oxidative phosphorylation generates 26 of the30 molecules of ATP that are formed when a molecule
of glucose is completely oxidized to CO
2and H2O,
although 1 to 2% of the electrons are lost during trans-fer through the chains leading to free radical generation
[25]. Figure 10 [26] shows a schematic representation of
the whole process along with free radical generation.The points shown with red stars correspond to the loca-tions where free radicals are generated.
Even though it has been long recognized that increased
ROS production in mitochondria leads to genetic instabil-
ity and progression of cancer, there remain several unan-swered questions regarding the complex signalling
capacity of this organelle [27]. The DNA is highly suscep-
tible to free radical attacks. Free radicals can break DNAstrands or delete bases. These mutations can prove to becarcinogenic. It has been estimated that more than 10,000hits of oxidative stress occur each day. So it is importantto tackle these free radicals at the source of their genera-tion, which is why the mitochondria is also a very richsource of anti-oxidants. Although cellular mechanisms can
tackle this stress, damage accumulates with age. At present

altered energy metabolism is considered to be an addi-
tional hall mark of cancer progression [28] and thesemetabolic pathways have been investigated as targets forcancer therapy. In this paper, we will specifically focus onthePI3k/Aktpathway which is one such pathway and is
described in the following section.
An integrated network for oxidative stress response
and apoptosis
Cancer is an umbrella term for diseases that are associated
with loss of cell-cycle control, leading to uncontrolled cellproliferation and/or reduced apoptosis. It is often causedby genetic alterations leading to malfunctioning in the bio-
logical pathways [1,29,30]. One of the possible cellular
responses resulting from oxidative stress is the induction
of apoptosis. Thus it is impo rtant to develop a network
model linking the oxidative stress input to the fate of thecell. In this section, we will do precisely that by consider-ing the oxidative stress response pathways alongside otherdownstream pathways capable of inducing apoptosis. Spe-cifically, we will focus on the PI3k/Aktpathway. The PI3k/
Akt pathway is downstream of the Ras gene which is
known to play an important role in many cancers. In addi-tion, other genes in the PI3k/Aktpathways are found
mutated in many cases of canc er. Oxidative stress often
upregulates many of the genes in the PI3k/Aktpathway.
The detailed interactions between the oxidative stressresponse pathway and the PI3k/Aktpathway are shown in
Figure 11 [1,31-33]. Starting with this pathway diagram
and utilizing the procedure d eveloped earlier in Section,
an equivalent digital circuit in terms of logic gates can be
implemented as shown in Figure 12. The above circuit ismodeled with two output genes which effectively controlthe final fate of the cell. Bad andBcl2 are known to have
pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions respectivelyand thus can serve as biomarkers of apoptosis induction.Indeed, it is the delicate balance between the activity of
these two genes that dictates the ultimate fate of the cell
[34-36]. The purpose of the Nrf2-ARE pathway in this
integrated network is to reduce the average value of ROS
present in the system, in response to the oxidative stress.This is clear from the plot in Figure 9: between the timeinstants from the 25
thtimestep to the 75thtimestep when
there is a continuous Stress present in the system, the ROS
present in the system is oscillating between 0 and 1 which
implies that its average value is less than ‘1’, which is the
value that we would have otherwise had in the absence of
theNrf2-ARE pathway.
Classification of faults in the integrated network
In the integrated pathway diagram of Figure 11, the twogenes namely Bad andBcl2 are instrumental in deciding
t h ef a t eo ft h ec e l l .T h ep r e f e r r e ds t a t u so ft h et w o
genes, when oxidative stress is not being neutralized, are
1 and 0 respectively since it corresponds to the situationwhere the pro-apoptotic factor is turned ON and theanti-apoptotic factor is turned OFF. Although a devia-tion from this state may not signal that the cell is turn-ing cancerous, there is a higher possiblity of the cellexhibiting aberrant behaviour.
Depending on the final resting status of these two genes,
one may be able to characterize the degree of invasivenessof the disease especially if it is being caused by apoptosissupression. Once it has been determined that a cell is

exhibiting abberant behavior, one would like to pinpoint
the location of the fault/error so that the necessary thera-peutic intervention(s) can be applied. Since the digital cir-cuit model of Figure 12 uses logic gates, it should be
possible to use the fault detection techniques from the
Digital Logic literature [37,38] to pinpoint the fault loca-tions. This will be carried out in this section. An importantdifference between the results obtained in Layek et al. [6]
for pinpointing the fault locations in the MAPKinase path-
ways and the results to be presented here is that the digitalcircuit in Figure 12 involves feedback and its behaviour is,therefore, much more complicated to analyze. However, it
should be pointed out that the simpler fault pinpointing
methodology presented in Layek et al. [6] is much more
amenable to biological validation via appropriatelydesigned experiments while the same cannot be said aboutthe results to be presented here. Indeed, the results to bepresented here show that the pinpointing of the fault loca-t i o n si st h e o r e t i c a l l yp o s s i b le even in this case, although
the biological feasibility of the methods required is open
to question.We note that the faults in a digital circuit are mainly
of two types [37]:

where a particular line lis stuck at a particular value

in. This can be thought of as something similar to a
mutation in a gene, where a particular gene is eitherpermanently turned ON or OFF.Bridging Faults: This is the type of fault where new
interconnections are int roduced among elements of
the network. This can be thought of as new pathwaysbeing created in the cell. This type of fault is not con-sidered in the current paper due to the lack of biologi-cal knowledge about new pathways being introduced.
Here, it is appropriate to mention that the biological
relevance of each of these two types of faults has been
discussed in Layek et al. [6].

The digital circuit in Figure 12 has feedback (shown in
bold lines) and is, therefore, a sequential circuit. To
detect a fault in a sequential circuit we need a testsequence. Let Tbe a test sequence and let R(q,T)b et h e
response of the fault-free sequential system Nstarting in
the intial state q. Now let the faulty sequential circuit be
denoted by N
fwhere fis the fault. Let us denote by Rf
(qf,T) the response of NftoTstarting in the initial state
qf. A test sequence Tdetects a fault fiff (if and only if
or equivalently this condition is both necessary and suf-ficient) for every possible pair of initial states qandq
f,
the output sequences R(q,T)a n dR f(qf,T)a r ed i f f e r e n t
for some specified vector tiÎT. The output being
observed is the status of [ Bad,Bcl2].
Once this output shows a deviation from a desired value,
it becomes imperative to pinpoint the possible fault loca-tions which can give rise to the aberrant behaviour. To doso, one can represent the digital circuit of Figure 12 as inFigure 13. The Primary Input(PI) is Stress which is the
only external signal which the experimenter has control
over. The Primary Output ’s( P O ’s) are the status of Bad
and Bcl2 ,w h i c ha r et h eo n l yo u t p u t sa v a i l a b l et ot h e
experimenter. The Secondary Output ’s and Secondary
Input ’s are [ ARE, Keap 1,M d m 2], which are being fed back
into the system. The states of these 3 genes ARE, Keap 1
andMdm 2 determine the internal state of the system.
These 3 elements can be considered as memory elements
of the system as their previous state is retained by thesystem and fed back. The input sequence consists of twoparts namely a Homing sequence and a Test sequence,denoted by HandTrespectively.
The purpose of this procedure is to pinpoint the possi-
ble locations for the fault finN
f,g i v e nt h eo u t p u t
sequence of Bad andBcl2 for the normal and faulty cir-
cuits. It is assumed that we have no knowledge about theinitial status of any of the genes. Knowledge of the initialstatus of the internal states is important as all futurecomputations are based on these values. The Homingsequence is an initial input sequence that brings the net-work to a known internal state. So, once the Homing
Sequence is given to NandN
f,Nwill come to a known
internal state. Note that a similar claim cannot be made
about Nfas the fault fis not known apriori. For the cir-
cuit in Figure 13, a possible Homing sequence is [0 0 0 00000 ] ,w h i c hb r i n g st h ei n t e r n a ls t a t eo ft h es y s t e mt o[0 1 0]. This means that if the Stress input is zero for
eight time steps, then at the end of that period, the inter-nal state of the system becomes [0 1 0], regardless of the
initial status of any of the genes in the network. A reason
for choosing this Homing sequence is that it implies thatno input needs to be given to the system and it evolves tothe indicated internal state. In future when we are tryingto validate these results experimentally this will be ofimmense help. If we refer back to Figure 7, we see thatregardless of the initial state, within four time steps thetrajectory reaches the state ( ’010010 ’) where ARE = 0 and

Keap 1 = 1. This is consistent with the conclusion that we
are getting from the Homing sequence here with the only
difference that a slightly longer sequence is required hereas the state transition diagram has a higher cardinalitythan that in Figure 7.
Once the Homing sequence has done its job, the Test
sequence( T)i sf e di n t oN andN
f,a n db yc o m p a r i n gt h e
output states of the normal and faulty networks, we canpinpoint the location of the fault in the network, assumingthat a single stuck-at-fault has occurred. This can be car-ried out using the time-frame expansion method which is
briefly discussed next. The block in Figure 13 is replicatedntimes with the feedback loops cut-off. The Secondary
Output of the k
thstage is fed as the Secondary Input for
the (k+1 )thstage. The Primary Outputs of the first ( n-1 )
stages are neglected. The Primary Outputs of the nthstage
of the normal and faulty circuits will be different as thenetwork configurations are different for both. The PrimaryInput sequence has to be derived so that the error in a lineis propagated to the primary output in ntime steps, so
that a difference is observed at the primary outputs of the
normal and faulty circuits [37,38]. The situation is picto-
rially represented in Figure 14. Please refer to Additionalfile 1 for to y example.
From the preceding discussion in this section, we know
that there are 15 possible genes (this is the total numberof genes in Figure 11, excluding the output genes Bad
andBcl2) where there could be a mutation. This means
that there are 30 cases of faults as a single gene can be
mutated as a s-a-0 or as a s-a-1. We consider all possible
cases of single mutation, because in the presence ofmutation, the normal and faulty system cannot produce
the same output unless, of course, the mutated gene isnot a critical one. Based on the methods described earlierin this section, we came up with a list of test sequencesfor the detection of each gene fault. It is to be noted that
the Test Sequences generated here are only for the Hom-
ing Sequence considered earlier. For a different HomingSequence the Test Sequence will also be different. Thedifferent test sequences and their ability to detect differ-ent single stuck-at faults are tabulated in Figure 15. Here,truncated versions of the same test sequence can be usedto detect different faults appearing in the same row. Fordetecting any particular fault, one would apply the test
sequence from the same row truncated at the bit whose
color matches that of the particular fault. The mismatchbetween the outputs of the normal and faulty systems,characterized by the vector [ Bad,Bcl2] would then result
in the detection of that fault. Thus we have developed amethod to pinpoint the possible fault locations in a Boo-lean network with feedback. The algorithm will workwith multiple fault cases too with minor modifications.
Concluding remarks
In this paper, we have developed a Boolean networkmodel for the oxidative stress response. This model wasdeveloped based on pathway information from the cur-rent literature pertaining to oxidative stress. Whereapplicable, the behaviour predicted by the model is inagreement with experimen tal observations from the
published literature. It is our hope that some of theadditional predictions here, such as those pertaining to

the oscillatory behaviour of certain genes in the pre-
sence of oxidative stress, will be experimentally validatedin the near future.
We have also linked the oxidative stress response to
the phenomenon of apoptosis via the PI3k/Aktpathway.
An integrated model based on collectively consideringthePI3k/Aktpathways and the oxidative stress response
pathways was developed and then used to pinpoint pos-sible fault locations based on the Bad-Bcl2 apoptotic
signatures in response to ‘test ’oxidative stress inputs.
The approach used to achieve this differs significantlyfrom the earlier results in Layek et al. [6] since the Boo-
lean network of this paper has feedback. The approachesused here and in Layek et al. [6] could potentially have

Of course, it should be pointed outthat the theoretical procedure presented here for pin-pointing fault locations in a biological network withfeedback will need to be further simplified before it canbe even considered for practical biological validation.

Abstract
Cell cycle control is fundamental in eukaryotic development. Several modeling efforts have
been used to integrate the complex network of interacting molecular components involvedin cell cycle dynamics. In this paper, we aimed at recovering the regulatory logic upstreamof previously known components of cell cycle control, with the aim of understanding themechanisms underlying the emergence of the cyclic behavior of such components. Wefocus on Arabidopsis thaliana , but given that many components of cell cycle regulation are
conserved among eukaryotes, when experimental data for this system was not available,we considered experimental results from yeast and animal systems. We are proposing aBoolean gene regulatory network (GRN) that converges into only one robust limit cycleattractor that closely resembles the cyclic behavior of the key cell-cycle molecular compo-nents and other regulators considered here. We validate the model by comparing our in sil-
icoconfigurations with data from loss- and gain-of-function mutants, where the endocyclic
behavior also was recovered. Additionally, we approximate a continuous model and recov-
ered the temporal periodic expression profiles of the cell-cycle molecular componentsinvolved, thus suggesting that the single limit cycle attractor recovered with the Booleanmodel is not an artifact of its discrete and synchronous nature, but rather an emergent con-sequence of the inherent characteristics of the regulatory logic proposed here. This dynam-ical model, hence provides a novel theoretical framework to address cell cycle regulation inplants, and it can also be used to propose novel predictions regarding cell cycle regulationin other eukaryotes.

stages different sets of proteins are active and genes are expressed. Understanding how
such cycling cellular behavior emerges and is robustly maintained in the face of changingdevelopmental and environmental conditions, remains a fundamental challenge of biol-
ogy. The molecular components that cycle through DNA duplication and citokinesis are
interconnected in a complex regulatory network. Several models of such network havebeen proposed, although the regulatory network that robustly recovers a limit-cycle steady
state that resembles the behavior of CC molecular components has been recovered only in
a few cases, and no comprehensive model exists for plants. In this paper we used the plantArabidopsis thaliana , as a study system to propose a core regulatory network to recover a
cyclic attractor that mimics the oscillatory behavior of the key CC components. Our analy-
ses show that the proposed GRN model is robust to transient alterations, and is validated
with the loss- and gain-of-function mutants of the CC components. The interactions pro-posed for Arabidopsis thaliana CC can inspire predictions for further uncovering regula-
tory motifs in the CC of other organisms including human.
Introduction
The eukaryotic cell cycle (CC) in multicellular organisms is regulated spatio-temporally to
yield normal morphogenetic patterns. In plants, organogenesis occurs over the entire lifespan,
thus CC arrest, reactivation, and cell differentiation, as well as endoreduplication should be
dynamically controlled at different points in time and space [ 1]. Endoreduplication is a varia-
tion of the CC, in which cells increase their ploidy but do not divide. Normal morphogenesis
thus depends on a tight molecular coordination among cell proliferation, cell differentiation,
cell death and quiescence. These biological processes share common regulators which are influ-enced by environmental and developmental stimuli [
1–3]. It would not be parsimonious to
depend on different regulatory circuits to control such interlinked cellular processes, CC
behaviors and responses. Thus we postulate that a common network is deployed in all of them.Such overall conserved CC network may then connect to different regulatory networks under-lying cell differentiation in contrasting tissue types or to signal transduction pathways elicited
under different conditions, and thus yield the emergence of contrasting cellular behaviors in
terms of cycling rate, entrance to endocycle, differentiation, etc.
Furthermore, the overall CC behaviors are widely conserved and robust among plants and
animals. Hence, we aim at further investigating the collective behavior of the key upstream reg-
ulators and studied CC components to understand the mechanisms involved in the robustnessof CC regulation under changing developmental stages and environmental conditions faced by
plants along their life-cycles. Previous studies, that have shown the oscillatory behavior of sev-
eral transcription factors, that had not been associated as direct regulators of the CC, supportour proposed hypothesis [
4]. We thus propose to uncovering the set of necessary and sufficient
regulatory interactions underlying the core regulatory network of plant CC, including some
key upstream transcriptional regulators.
Computational tools are essential to understanding the collective and dynamical behavior
of these components within the regulatory networks involved. As a means of uncovering the
main topological and architectural traits of such networks, we propose to use Boolean formal-
isms that are simple and have proven to be useful and powerful to follow changes in the activityof regulators of complex networks in different organisms and biological processes [
5,6].
Although the key CC components have been described in different organisms, the complex-
ity and dynamic nature of the molecular interactions that are involved in CC regulation and

the emergence of the cyclic behavior of the CC molecular components are not well understood
yet. The use of systemic, dynamic and mathematical or computational approaches has been
useful towards this already. Previous models have focused mainly on yeast and animal systemsand have been useful to analyze many traits of CC behavior such as robustness, hysteresis, irre-versibility and bistability [
7–11]. The latter two properties have been validated with experimen-
tal data [ 12–14].
We herein summarize the main traits and components of the eukaryotic CC. The molecular
CC regulators have been described and they are well conserved across distantly related organ-
isms [ 15,16]. CC progression is regulated by Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) [ 17] that asso-
ciate with different cyclins to confer substrate specificity [ 18]. CDK-cyclin complexes trigger
the transition from G1 (Gap 1) to synthesis phase (S phase) in where the genome is duplicated,
and from G2 (Gap 2) to mitotic phase (M phase) for the delivery of the newly duplicated DNA
to the two daughter cells [ 19] (see for a review [ 17,20]). The CDK-cyclin activity also regulates
the cell transit between G and S phases during the endoreduplication process [ 21,22].
Two CDKs (CDKA and CDKB) are involved in CC regulation. CDKA;1-CYCDs and
CDKA;1-CYCA3 complexes regulate G1/S and S phase progression [ 23–25]; while
CDKB-CYCA2 and CDKB-CYCBs regulate G2/M phase and M progression [ 26–28]. Thus
CDK-cyclin activity is finely-tuned by phosphorylation, interactions with CDK inhibitors such
as Kip-related proteins (KRPs), and degradation of cyclins and KRPs by Skp1/Cullin/F-
box (SCF), as well as by the anaphase-promoting complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) [ 29–31].
Besides these components, plant CC machinery has a greater number of CC regulators than
other eukaryotes and some of those components such as the CDKB are plant-specific.
Several key transcriptional regulators participate in the G1/S and G2/M transitions [ 32].
The E2F/RBR pathway regulates G1/S transition by transcriptional modulation of many genes
required for CC progression and DNA replication [ 33,34]. While E2Fa and E2Fb with their
dimerization partner (DP) activate transcription of a subset of S phase genes, E2Fc-DPrepresses transcription [
35]. The function of E2Fa and E2Fb is inhibited by their interaction
with RBR [ 36]; in G1/S transition CDKA;1-CYCD-mediated RBR hyperphosphorylation,
releases E2Fa/b-DP heterodimers allowing transcriptional activation of E2Fa and E2Fb targets.
Simultaneously the E2Fc-DP transcriptional inhibitor is degraded [ 37].
Little is known about the regulation of G2/M transition in plants, however a class of con-
served transcription factors belonging to the MYB family has been described, that seem to have
key roles in CC regulation. MYB transcription factors have a prominent role during G2/Mtransition, by regulating, for example, CYCB1;1 which is determinant in triggering mitosis
[
38–43]. For the mitosis exit, APC/C mediates degradation of the mitotic cyclins as CYCB1;1
and CYCA2;3, inactivating CDK-cyclin complexes. CCS52A2, an activator subunit of APC/C,is transcriptionally inhibited by E2Fe [
44].
Some previous models have recovered the limit cycle attractor as well for CC components
[45–48]. A pioneer model of the CC focused on mitotic CDK-cyclin heterodimer and a cyclin
protease oscillatory behavior [ 49]. On the other hand, Novak and Tyson incorporated addi-
tional nodes and interactions to model the G1/S and G2/M transitions of the S. pombe CC [50,
51]. They also analyzed evolutionary roles of CC regulators [ 52], mutant phenotypes [ 53], sta-
ble steady states [ 7] and the role of cues such as cell size or pheromones in CC progression [ 54,
55]. Additionally, comprehensive CC continuous models [ 45] and generic modules for eukary-
otic CC regulation [ 56,57] have been proposed.
In addition to continuous formalisms, CC models have used discrete approaches as Boolean
models for yeast and mammalian systems [ 46–48,58–61], and more recently, hybrid models
for mammalian cells have been published [ 62]. Subsequently, time-delayed variables [ 63] and
variables defining CC events [ 47,48] were incorporated. Time robustness was improved with

specifications of the temporal order with which each component is activated [ 60]. Recent pub-
lished reports on CC dynamics use steady state probability distributions and potential land-
scapes, and highlight the enormous potential of CC models to characterize normal and alteredregulation of mammalian CC [
64,65].
Yeast CC Boolean models with summatory thresholds [ 58,59], incorporated self-degrada-
tion for proteins, but did not incorporate several negative regulators explicitly. In a later work
[61], nodes were kept active when the summatory effect of their regulators was greater than the
activation threshold, which implies self-degradation of the protein, when such summatory is
equal to or below the threshold. Fauré and Thieffry have transformed CC Boolean models, that
use threshold functions, to models with a combinatorial scheme, and they have also presenteda broader discussion about these two approaches to logical frameworks [
66].
Two Boolean models of budding yeast CC and another one of mammalian CC recover cyclic
attractors [ 46–48]. The mammalian CC model [ 46] also recovers a fixed-point attractor corre-
sponding to G0. In another study, Fauré and collaborators integrated three modules to yield a
comprehensive model for the budding yeast CC GRN [ 47]. The components included variables
to represent cellular growth, citokinesis, bud formation, DNA replication and the formation ofthe spindle. The yeast CC model by Irons also included variables of CC events (e.g. bud forma-tion or DNA replication) as well as time delays [
48]. In contrast to other eukaryotes, in Arabi-
dopsis thaliana (A. thaliana herein) very few attempts have been made to integrate available
experimental data on CC regulators using mechanistic models. Only a study that considers theG1/S transition has been proposed and contributed to show some additional conserved features
of this CC control point among eukaryotes [
67].
We integrated available experimental data on 29 A. thaliana regulatory interactions involved
in CC progression into a Boolean discrete model, that recovers key properties of the observed
plant CC. The regulatory network, that we put forward, also incorporates three uncovered inter-
actions, based on animal systems (E2Fb !SCF, CDKB1;1-CYCA2;3 aE2Fa, APC/C aSCF), as
well as 16 interactions based on bioinformatic analyses. Therefore, the latter proposed interac-tions constitute new predictions that should be tested experimentally. The use of yeast or animal
data is supported by the fact that main CC components or regulatory motifs are conserved
among eukaryotes [
16]. In our model, we include solely molecular components and avoid artifi-
cial self-degradation loops, which have been used for recovering the limit cycle attractor. We vali-
dated the model simulating loss- and gain-of-function lines, and hence demonstrate that the
Boolean network robustly implements true dynamical features of the biological CC regulatorynetwork under wild type and genetic alterations. Possible artifacts due to the discrete dynamical
nature of the model used, and of its synchronous updating scheme, were discarded by comparing
the Boolean model results to those of a continuous approximation model. The continuous modelindeed recovers the robust limit cycle that mimics the dynamical behavior of CC components
under a wide range of parameters tested. Finally, we provide novel predictions that can be tested
against biological experimental measurements in future studies. The model put forward consti-tutes a first mechanistic and integrative explanation to A. thaliana CC.
Materials and Methods
Boolean model
We proposed a Boolean approach to integrate and study the qualitative complex logic of regu-
lation of the molecular components underlying the CC dynamics. We formalized availableexperimental data on logical functions and tables of truth that rule how the state of a particular
component is altered as a function of the states of all the components that regulate it. In a Bool-
ean model each node state can be 0, when the expression of a gene or other type of molecular

component or complex of such components is unexpressed or “OFF ”, or 1 when it is expressed,
or“ON ”. Nodes states are updated according to the function: Xi(t+1) = Fi(Xi1(t),Xi2(t),...,
Xik(t)), where Xi(t+1) is the state of Xigene at time t+1 and Xi1(t),Xi2(t),...,Xik(t) is the set of
its regulators at time t. The set of logical rules for all the network components defines the
dynamics of the system. By applying the logical rules to all nodes for several iterations, the
dynamics of the whole network can be followed until it reaches a steady state; a configuration
or set of configurations that does not change any more or are visited in a cyclical manner,respectively. Such state is called an “attractor ”. Single-point attractors only have one GRN con-
figuration, or cyclic attractors with period n, which have nconfigurations that are visited indef-
initely in the same order. In this paper we propose a GRN model that converges to a singlelimit cycle attractor that recovers the CC molecular components ’states of presence (network
configuration) in a cyclic pattern that mimics the pattern observed for the molecular compo-
nents included in the model along the different CC phase.
Model assumptions
A. thaliana CC Boolean model has the following assumptions:
1. Nodes represent mRNA, proteins or protein complexes involved in CC phase transitions.
Node state “ON ”is for the presence of regulator, and “OFF ”is for absence; in the latter case,
it may also indicate instances in which a component may be present but non-functional dueto a post-translational modification.
2. The state of the RBR (RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED) node corresponds to a 1 or “ON ”
when this protein is in its hypo-phosphorylated form and therefore is ready to inhibit E2Ftranscription factors.
3. When a particular CDK is not specified, a cyclin can form a complex with CDKA;1, a kinase
that is always present because it is expressed in proliferative tissues [
68] during the complete
CC.
4. E2Fa, E2Fb and E2Fc need dimerization partner proteins (DPa or DPb) for its DNA-bind-
ing. Given that DP expression does not change drastically in CC [ 69], we assumed that the
state of these heterodimers is given only by the presence of E2F factors.
5. The Boolean logical functions integrate and formalize experimental data available mainly
for the A. thaliana root apical meristem, however some data from leaves were considered,
and we assumed that these are also valid for CC regulation in the root meristem. Also, data
from other systems and data obtained by sequence promoter analysis were considered as
indicated in each case [ 27,39,40,67,70–85] (summarized in Table 1 ).
6. The dynamics of complex formation (such as CDK-cyclin and KRP1, or RBR and E2F fac-
tors) are specified directly in the Boolean function of their target genes. For instance, the
logic rule for E2Fb is E2Fa &!RBR , indicating that E2Fb state is “ON ”when it is transcrip-
tionally activated by E2Fa free of RBR. All E2Fa targets also included in their logical rulesRBR, as is shown in
S1 Text . Then, the presence of KRP1 or RBR in a logical rule does not
imply that they are regulators acting directly on the corresponding target.
7. The updating scheme for the node states was synchronous.
Periodic expression and promoter sequence analysis
Most regulatory interactions and logical rules were obtained from the A. thaliana data [ 20,21,
25–27,29,30,35,37,38,40,43,44,78–80,85–103] (detailed in Table 2 ).A. thaliana CC-

dependent expression data for validation was obtained from: [ 72–74]. The consensus site used
for MYB77 was CNGTTR, according to: [ 75,76], while that for MYB3R4 was AACGG accord-
ing to: [ 43]. The motifs were searched in the regulatory sequences of all network nodes using
Pathmatch tool ( http://arabidopsis.org/cgi-bin/patmatch/nph-patmatch.pl ) of TAIR. Regula-
tory sequences in TAIR10 Loci Upstream Sequences-1000bp and TAIR10 5 ’UTRs datasets
were used.
Software for robustness analysis and mutant simulation
We used BoolNet [104] (a library of Rlanguage [ 105]) and Atalia (Á. Chaos; http://web.
ecologia.unam.mx/achaos/Atalia/atalia.htm ) to simulate the CC GRN dynamics and perform
robustness, and mutant analyses. Systematic alterations in Boolean functions for robustnessTable 1. Hypothetical Interactions for the A. thaliana CC Network.
Regulator Target Data supporting the proposition of the interaction Refs.
E2Fb ! SCF F-box protein Skp2 is part of the SCF complex and is transcriptionally
regulated by E2F1 in humans. In A. thaliana , it has only been reported that
E2F factors regulate FBL17, another F-box protein.[67,70]
E2Fb ! MYB77 Direct regulation between E2F and MYB factors has been reported in
budding yeast and mammals, but in plants it could include at least one
intermediary; A. thaliana could have a similar regulation because its CC also
presents transcriptional waves in G1/S and G2/M transitions as yeasts andmammals. After analyzing the two main families of transcription factors
involved in CC regulation: TCP and MYB, we propose MYB77 as a mediator
between E2F and MYB regulation. Using available microarray analyses, we
found that MYB77 shows CC-dependent expression with a peak in M phase.
In addition to having binding sites for E2F, with the identi ﬁcation of the
binding site recognized by MYB77, we can hypothesize that MYB77
regulates MYB3R1/4 and other CC genes.[
39,
71–74]
MYB77 ! E2Fe, KRP1, MYB3R1/4,
CYCB1;1, CYCA2;3, CDKB1;1,CCS52A2The sequence CNGTTR identi ﬁed as a consensus site recognized by
MYB77 was used to ﬁnd its possible targets among CC core genes. Several
of them are expressed just before G2 to M phase transition.[
75–77]
MYB3R1/4 ! SCF, RBR, CDKB1;1, CYCA2;3,
APC/C, E2Fc, MYB3R1/4, KRP1The consensus site of MYB3R4 was found in SKP2A, RBR, CDKB1;1,
CYCA2;3, CCS52A2, KRP1, E2Fc, MYB3R1/4 and CYCB1;1 by in silico
analysis described in the Materials and Methods section. In tobacco,
NtmybA1 and NtmybA2 genes have the MSA sequence and they can
regulate themselves. MYB3R1/4 might promote the expression of KRP1,
since KRP1 has a peak of expression in G2/M and has eight putative MSA
elements. CYCB1;1 regulation by MYB3R1/4 also has experimental support.[40,78]
CDKB1;1-CYCA2;3 aE2Fa It has been hypothesized that a cause of low levels of E2Fa could be due to
its high turnover rate as result of CDKB1;1 phosphorylation. This E2F factor
has putative CDK-phosphorylation sites in its N-terminal end, and a high
CDK activity inversely correlates with its DNA binding ability in vitro . This
hypothesis is supported by observations in mammalian cells.[27,
79–81]
APC/C aSCF It was proposed that APC/C and SCF functions are mutually exclusive during
CC progression, which led to the identi ﬁcation of the relationship amongst
them. In proliferating mammal cells, levels of Skp2, a SCF subunit, oscillate
under the pattern of APC/C substrates. Furthermore, the APC/C subunit
Cdh1 participates in the degradation of Skp2 and the reduction of Cdh1expression stabilizes Skp2. A. thaliana SCF and APC/C seem have the same
roles during CC as their animal counterparts.[
82–85]
A summary of the data led us to propose interactions that have not been previously described for A. thaliana CC.astands for negative regulation and !
for positive regulation.

analyses were done with Atalia, while stochastic perturbations in random networks to compare
attractor ’s robustness were done with BoolNet. For random perturbations made in transitions
between network configurations or in Boolean functions, the “bitflip ”method was applied. To
validate the GRN model proposed here, we used BoolNet and simulated loss- and gain-of-func-tion mutations for each node, by skipping the node ’s logical rule and setting the respective
gene to “0”and “1”, respectively.Table 2. Experimental Interactions for the A. thaliana CC Network and their Evidence.

Continuous model
For the continuous model, we followed [ 106,107]. In the continuous version of the model the
rate of change for each xinode is represented by a differential equation that comprises produc-
tion as well as decay rates:
dxi
dt¼/C0e0:5hþe/C0h/C3ðoiÞ
ð1/C0e0:5hÞ/C3ð 1þe/C0h/C3ðoi/C00:5ÞÞ/C0gixi ð1Þ
The parameter hdetermines the form of the curve; when his very close to 0, the curve
becomes a straight line, while with values close to 100, the curve approximates a step function.
The parameter ωiis the continuous form of Fi(Xi1(t),Xi2(t),...,Xik(t)) used in the Boolean
model, and γiis its degradation rate. Detailed information about the continuous model can be
found in S2 Text .
Results
The regulatory network recovers a dynamical model of A. thaliana CC
The CC model proposed here integrates and synthesizes published data for A. thaliana CC
components interactions, as well as some molecular data from other organisms (mammal andyeast), that we propose as predictions for A. thaliana CC regulation, and assume to be con-
served among all eukaryotes. The whole set of interactions and nodes included in the model
and detailed in Tables
1and2are shown in Fig 1 . Four types of molecular interactions can be
distinguished: (i) transcriptional regulation, (ii) ubiquitination, (iii) phosphorylation and (iv)physical protein-protein interactions. Additionally, an in silico analysis of transcription factors
and promoters was carried out, in order to further substantiate 16 predicted interactions in the
GRN (these are: E2Fb !MYB77; MYB77 !E2Fe, MYB3R1/4, KRP1, CYCB1;1, CYCA2;3,
CDKB1;1 and CCS52A2; MYB3R1/4 !SCF, RBR, CDKB1;1, CYCA2;3, APC/C, KRP1, E2Fc
and MYB3R1/4). The logical rules are available in
S1 Text .
Our results show that the nodes and interactions considered are sufficient to recover a single
robust cyclic steady state, and thus the cyclic behavior of the components considered. Suchbehavior closely resembles the periodic patterns observed during actual CC progression,
Fig 2 .
The first two columns or network configurations match a G1 state, given that during the early
G1 phase, the CDKA;1-CYCD3;1 complex is absent or inactive by the presence of KRP1 [ 92,
93,108]. The CDKA;1-CYCD3;1 state is given only by the presence of CYCD3;1 since CDKA;1
is always expressed in proliferative cells [ 68]. To facilitate understanding, in Fig 2 the complex
CDKA;1-CYCD3;1 is shown instead of only CYCD3;1. The absence of mitotic cyclins(CYCA2;3 and CYCB1;1) at this stage [
28,38], as well as the APC/C presence until the early
G1 phase, which is needed for the mitosis exit, also coincides with experimental observations
[44,109,110]. The presence of the RBR protein in G1-phase implies an inactive state of the
E2F, as expected [ 33,111,112]. Then, the third column resembles G1/S transition, where the
presence of CDKA;1-CYCD3;1 complex would be inducing RBR phosphorylation and its inac-
tivation [ 32]. In the fourth configuration, the S-phase is represented by RBR inactivation and
E2Fa/b transcriptional activation [ 113]. In the fifth and sixth configuration, E2Fc state returns
to“ON ”but RBR state is kept in “OFF ”, which indicates that transcription driven by E2Fa and
E2Fb can still happen. Indeed, the E2Fb factor appears from the fifth configuration and it is
consistent with their function regulating the expression of genes needed to achieve the G2/Mtransition. In the sixth configuration, MYB77 is turned on, although in synchronization experi-
ments it has been observed to be on until the beginning of mitosis [
73]. During G2-phase the
MYB transcription factors and KRP1 are expressed [ 31,73,93], the former would maintain

dimers of CDKA;1 and mitotic cyclins inactive; and together, this data is consistent with what
is observed in the seventh configuration of the CC attractor. In the eighth column, KRP1 is lost
because it was phosphorylated by CDKB1;1-CYCA2;3, which is active in the G2/M transition
and the onset of mitosis [ 27]. The phosphorylation of KRP1 drives its degradation and poste-
rior activation of mitotic complexes such as CDKA;1-CYCB1;1 to trigger mitosis [ 21,78] (con-
figuration 9 and 10 in Fig 2 ). The lack of APC/C at the onset of mitosis is determinant for the
accumulation of the mitotic cyclins, but APC/C presence is necessary for the mitosis exit [ 110],
which occurs in the eleventh configuration of the attractor ( Fig 2 ). Thus, our CC GRN model
recovers a unique attractor of eleven network configurations ( Fig 2 ), which shows a congruent

Nodes are proteins or complexes of proteins and edges stand for the existing types of relationships among nodes. The trapezoid nodes are transcriptio n
factors, the circles are cyclins, the squares are CDKs, the triangle represent stoichiometric CDK inhibitor, the hexagons are E3-ubiquitin ligase c omplexes
and the octagon is a negative regulator of E2F proteins. Edges with arrow heads are positive regulations and edges with flat ends illustrate negativeregulations. The red edges indicate regulation by phosphorylation while blue ones indicate ubiquitination, the green ones show physical protein-p rotein

cyclic behavior of its components with that observed experimentally. This result validates that
the proposed set of restrictions converge to a single cyclic behavior, which is independent of
the initial conditions. A further validation of the proposed CC model, would imply that the
recovered cyclic attractor is robust to permanent alterations, as is the case for real CC behaviorthat is highly robust to external and internal perturbations [
14,58,114,115].
The CC Boolean model is robust to alterations
To provide further validation for the proposed CC regulatory network, we performed robust-
ness analyses of the attractor to four types of alterations in the logical functions of the model.
First, we altered the output of each logical rule by systematically flipping one by one, each oneof their bits. We found that 87.47% of the perturbed networks recovered the original attractor,
while 1.77% of the altered networks maintained the original attractor and produced new ones
(see supplementary material
S3 Text for details). In contrast, the remaining 10.76% of alter-
ations reduced the number of network configurations of the original attractor. In the second
robustness analysis, after calculating the transitions between one network configuration to the
next one, one bit (i.e. the state of a node) of this next configuration is randomly chosen and itsvalue changed. Then, the network is reconstructed and its attractors recovered again. This pro-cedure was repeated 100 times, thus we found that in 88.2 ± 3.2 out of the 100 perturbations
(mean ± SD) the original attractor was reached. These results suggest that the proposed GRN
forA. thaliana CC is robust to alterations as expected and in coincidence with previous GRN
models proposed for other developmental processes [
116,117].
To confirm that the robustness recovered in these two types of analyses is a specific property
of the network under study, we performed robustness analyses of randomly generated
Fig 2. Attractor corresponding to a dynamic network of CC in A. thaliana .100% of the whole set of network configurations converges to a unique
attractor composed by 11 configurations. Each column is a network configuration (state of each network component) and the rows represent the state of each
node during CC progression. The squares in green indicate components that are in an “ON”state and the ones in red are nodes in an “OFF ”state.

networks with similar structures (same number of input interactors for the logical functions)
to the one proposed here for the A. thaliana CC regulatory network, and compared the above
robustness analyses results to those recovered for equivalent analyses for the random networks.We generated 1000 random networks. Then, 100 copies of the random and of our networkwere done. In each copy we randomly flipped the value of one bit in one logical function (to
confirm the first robustness analysis), or in one next configuration (for the second robustness
analysis). When perturbations are made in logical functions, the A. thaliana CC GRN recovers
its attractor in 68% of perturbations, while the median of percentage of cases in which such
attractor was recovered in the random networks was only 18.55% (mean 19.12% ± 13.86 SD,
Fig 3A ). The difference between the 68% of this latter analysis and the 87.47% of the first
robustness analysis could be due to sampling error. If transitions between network configura-
tions are perturbed, the median of original attractors recovered in random networks is 24.2%
(mean 24.6% ± 18.2 SD). In contrast, the original attractor of A. thaliana CC GRN was found
in 88% of perturbed networks starting with that grounded on experimental data ( Fig 3B ).
These results confirm that the CC GRN proposed here is much more robust than randomly
generated networks with similar topologies and suggests that its robustness is not due to overallstructural properties of the network.
Boolean models can produce cyclic dynamics as an artifact due to their discrete nature and
the time delays implied. To address this issue we approximated the Boolean model to a contin-
uous system of differential equations following [
106,107,118,119]. To recover steady states of
such continuous system, the continuous versions of the GRN were evaluated for 1000 different
randomly picked initial conditions (See S2 Text ). In all cases and independently of the method-
ology (i.e. [ 106,107]o r[ 118,119]), we recovered the same limit cycle steady state. In the con-
tinuous model, key cyclins for the main phase transitions, CYCD3;1 and CYCB1;1, have an
oscillatory behavior that is not attenuated with time ( Fig 4 ). Importantly, this result is robust to
changes in the decay rates or alterations of the hparameter that affects the shape of activation
function (see details in S2 Text ); the limit cycle was recovered in 92.86% of the cases. The
results of the continuous model corroborate that the limit cycle attractor recovered by the Bool-
ean version, is not due to an artifact associated to the discrete and synchronous nature of the
Boolean model, but is rather an emergent property of the underlying network architecture andtopology. In addition, the recovery of the cyclic behavior of the continuous model constitutes a
further robustness test for the Boolean model.
Previous studies have also tested asynchronous updating schemes [
46]. In this study we have
used a continuous form of the model to discard that the recovered cyclic attractor is due to an
artifact owing to the discrete and synchronous nature of the model used. Future studies could
approach analyses of asynchronous behavior of the model by devising some priority classes dis-tinguishing fast and slow processes, and thus refining the asynchronous attractor, under a plausi-
ble updating scheme. On the other hand, biological time delays may be involved in CC
progression, but they are not enough for irreversibility. The CC unidirectionality has been pro-posed to be a consequence of system-level regulation [
120], here we hypothesize that the ordered
transitions of A. thaliana CC are an emergent property of network architecture and dynamics.
Simulated loss- and gain-of-function mutants recover observed patterns:
normal CC and endocycle
An additional validation analysis for the proposed A. thaliana CC model implies simulating
loss- and gain-of-function mutations and comparing the recovered attractors with the expres-
sion profiles documented experimentally for each mutant tested. We simulated mutants by fix-
ing the corresponding node to 0 or 1 in loss- and gain-of-functions mutations, respectively.

The recovered altered configurations are summarized in S4 Text , and in Table 3 as well as in
Table 4 for gain- and loss-of-function mutants, respectively. The simulated mutant attractors
are coherent with experimental data in most cases [ 2,21,23,30,35,37,43,44,76,79,80,88,
90–93,103,108,109,111,113,114,121 –129]. InFig 5 we show a representative example of
attractors recovered by simulations of CDKB1;1 and KRP1 loss-of-function and APC/C andE2Fa gain-of-function mutants. It is noteworthy that several simulated mutants, such as
mitotic cyclins or B-type CDK loss-of-function, converge to a cyclic attractor that corresponds
to the configuration observed under an endoreduplicative cycle (e.g.
Fig 5A ). In such attractors,
endoreduplication inductors, such as APC/C, KRP1 and E2Fc [ 37,78,130] are present, at least
in some network configurations ( Fig 5A, 5C and 5D -right). Another outstanding feature of
these mutant attractors is that, although mitotic CDK-cyclin complex may be present, it isinhibited by KRP1, therefore there is no CDK-cyclin activity to trigger the onset of mitosis.
These data are coincident with the reported regulation during the onset of endoreduplication
[
21]. In the attractors where E2Fa coincides with alternating states of RBR, it suggests that
DNA replication may occur ( Fig 5 ). Likely due to plant redundancy, some mutations do not
produce an obvious impaired phenotype. Such is the case of KRP1 loss-of-function, in which
loss-of-function simulation, a cyclic attractor identical to the original one is recovered, as is
expected (see Table 4 ), because such mutants do not show an evident altered CC behavior ( Fig
5B)[93].
Interestingly, the simulation of a constitutively active APC/C also converges to a single
cyclic attractor, which corresponds to an endoreduplication cycle, since it has Gap and Sphases, but lacks an M-phase configuration. This coincides with the experimental observation
that the overexpression of one of the APC/C subunits (CCS52A) promotes entry to an endo-
cycle [
44] (see Table 3 ). Another interesting example is the gain-of-function mutation of E2Fa
that yields two cyclic attractors, one corresponding to the normal CC cycle and the other one

checkpoints. A little more than two complete CC are shown (upper horizontal axis) to confirm that oscillations are maintained.

to an endocycle ( Table 3 ). It has been shown that this gene is required for both processes [ 111]
that are apparently exclusive, although in both processes the DNA replication occurs and
among E2Fa targets there are genes required for S-phase. Thus our model suggests that the reg-
ulation of E2Fa at the end of G2 phase is decisive for CC exit and transition to endoreduplica-tion. In this E2Fa gain-of-function simulation, we found an inconsistency with APC/C becausethis E3 ubiquitin ligase is decisive for endoreduplication, while in the simulated attractor is
only present in one network configuration (
Fig 5D -right). Such behavior observed in the
endoreduplication attractor for E2Fa gain-of-function leads to unstable activity in the CDK-cyclin complex (
Fig 5D ), thus suggesting that the increase in APC/C is required for endoredu-
plication entry as well as its progression. In the attractor of the simulated APC/C gain-of-func-
tion, the states of the CYCD3;1, SCF, E2Fb, E2Fc and MYB nodes are more stable than inTable 3. Phenotypes of gain-of-function mutations in CC components.

endoreduplication attractors of CDKB1;1 loss-of-function or E2Fa gain-of-function, where
E2Fb, E2Fc and MYB factors expression states alternate between “ON ”and “OFF ”(Fig 5 ).
We highlight APC/C gain-of-function simulations, as it provides a possible mechanism for
plant hormones action over the CC machinery and, thus how such key morphogens regulatecell proliferation patterns. Recently, Takahashi and collaborators reported a direct connectionbetween cytokinins and CC machinery in A. thaliana root [
131]. The authors showed that
ARR2, a transcriptional factor of cytokinins signaling, induces expression of APC/C activator
protein CCS52A1. Our simulated APC/C gain-of-function is congruent with that observation,since it reproduces the configuration attained by a cell entering an endocycle when APC/C
activity is enhanced (
Fig 5C ), as it happens at the elongation zone of A. thaliana root. There-
fore, our model is able to recover the attractors of loss- and gain-of-function mutant pheno-types reported experimentally, and it thus provides a mechanistic explanation for observed
patterns of expression in both normal CC and during endoreduplication cycles or endocycle.Table 4. Phenotypes of loss-of-function mutations in CC components.

Plant E2Fc and KRP1: validation of A. thaliana CC GRN
We test if the CC GRN recovers the periodic patterns observed in synchronization experiments
ofA. thaliana CC molecular components. Interestingly, the E2Fc repressor and KRP1 are regu-
lators that have two short lapses of expression in the attractor recovered in the continuous
model ( Fig 6 ), and experimentally they also show two peaks of expression when synchronized
with aphidicolin [ 74]. In such synchronization experiments, the expression of E2Fc increases

function produced only one cyclic attractor with period 7 that resembles G1 !S!G2!G1 cycle, whereas in (B) with simulation of loss of KRP1 function,
one cyclic attractor was attained, which has period 11 and comprises 100% of the initial conditions. This attractor is almost identical to WT phenotyp e but
without KRP1. With the simulation of APC/C gain-of-function, a single attractor with period 7 was recovered, which is shown in (C) and is consistent wi th an
endoreduplication cycle. Attractors obtained with the simulation of E2Fa overexpression are shown in (D). Two attractors were found, one of them has period

from late S to middle G2, but then it decreases dramatically in late G2. In the model, E2Fc
appears from S to G2 phase, and then a second increment of E2Fc expression in G2/M is
observed. The latter correspondence is a further validation of the CC GRN model proposed
here. Furthermore, synchronization experiments using sucrose have shown that KRP1 isexpressed previous to G1/S transition and before mitosis [
132], in a similar way that occurs in
the model. More recently it has been proposed that KRP1 has a role during G1/S and G2/M
transitions [ 93]; the latter should be important for endoreduplication control [ 78]. Once again,
such roles and expression profiles are consistent with the recovered active state of KRP1 in ourmodel.
In contrast with the consistent behaviors of E2Fc and KRP1 components to recovered
results with our model, E2Fe results do not coincide with previous observations. In our modelthis E2F factor presents only one peak from S to early M phase, but according to synchroniza-
tion experiments [
69], E2Fe has two peaks of expression. One of its peaks is due to regulation
by other E2F family factors during S phase, while the G2/M peak could be due to MSA ele-ments. Indeed, when the regulatory motifs for E2F binding are deleted from E2Fe, it can still beexpressed although at lower levels [
96], suggesting that additional transcription factors regulate
its expression. Such factors could belong to the MYB family as suggested for the A. thaliana
CC GRN proposed here.
Discussion
The canonical cyclic behavior of eukaryotic cells as they go from DNA duplication to cytokine-sis suggests that a conserved underlying mechanism with shared molecular components and/or regulatory logic should exist. While yeast and animal CC have been thoroughly studied andmodelled, plant CC is less studied and no comprehensive model for it has been proposed.
In this study we put forward a Boolean model of the A. thaliana CC GRN. We show that
this model robustly recovers a single cyclic attractor or steady state with 11 network configura-tions. Such configurations correspond to those observed experimentally for the CC compo-
nents included here at each one of the CC stages. In addition, the canonical order of sequential
transitions that is recovered also mimics the observed temporal pattern of transition from one

configuration to another one along the CC ( Fig 2 ). The fact that the 16,384 initial conditions of
the proposed system converge to this single cyclic attractor already suggests that the GRN com-
prises a robust module that integrates the necessary and sufficient set of components and inter-actions to recover molecular oscillations experimentally observed. The proposed GRN is alsorobust to alterations, being similarly robust to previously published models for other cell differ-
entiation or developmental modules [
116,117,133]. The model is validated because it recovers
A. thaliana wild type and altered (in gain- and loss-of-function) configurations and cycling
behaviors. The comparison between experimentally observed and recovered gene configura-
tions is summarized in Tables 3and4.
Some cyclins such as CYCD3;1 and CYCB1;1, important components during G1/S and G2/
M transitions, show a mutually exclusive regulation, as occurs in a predator-prey Lotka-Vol-
terra dynamical system [ 134], even though they do not interact directly. Their mutual exclu-
sion is achieved thanks to the coordinated expression of genes with specific proteolyticdegradation capacity. Our cyclic attractor shows two transcriptional periods, one of them in S-
phase regulated by E2F-RBR pathway, and the second one operating at a time previous to M-
phase and regulated by MYB transcription factors. The SCF and APC/C ubiquitin ligases workduring G2-to-M phases, and during mitosis exit, respectively. Therefore, the fourteen nodesand their interactions proposed in the CC GRN constitute a necessary and sufficient set of
restrictions to recover the oscillations of node states characteristic of CC phases.
Two alternative possibilities could drive CC progression in actual organisms. The first
would imply that transitions from one CC state to the next would require external cues, like
the cell size. The alternative possibility is that CC progression and the temporal pattern of tran-
sitions among stages are both emergent consequences of an underlying complex regulatorynetwork, and do not require external cues, or these only reinforce such temporal progression
emergent from complex underlying regulatory interactions. Our CC GRN model supports the
latter. This does not imply that several internal or external signals or molecules, such as hor-mones or other types of cues could alter the CC. Therefore, the two alternative possibilities arenot exclusive but they likely complement or enhance each other. Indeed, A. thaliana CC is reg-
ulated by plant hormones, light, sucrose, osmotic stress [
135] or oxidative stress [ 136]. These
could now be modelled as CC modulators.
In the model proposed here we avoided redundancy. For instance, the KRP1 node repre-
sents the KRP family members that share several functions. Also the metaphase-anaphase tran-
sition could be added to the model when more data about APC/C regulation (i.e. negativefeedback loop comprising CDK-cyclin complexes, or the regulation of Cdc20 homologues)
becomes available in plants. Apparently, these simplifications did not disrupt the main features
of the A. thaliana CC, since the cyclic behavior distinctive of the CC components was correctly
recovered.
A mechanistic model for the A. thaliana CC: novel predictions
Our proposed GRN model suggests some predictions regarding the regulation of certain CC
components in A. thaliana . Such predictions can be classified into two types. The first type per-
tains to those recovered by in silico promoter analysis. The predictions of the second type were
inferred from data of other eukaryotes, because they seem to imply conserved components and
some evidence from A. thaliana suggested that these interactions are part of the CC GRN in A.
thaliana . Three interactions belong to the second type, E2Fb !SCF, CDKB1;1-CYCA2;3 a
E2Fa and APC/C aSCF (see Table 1 for a synthesis of hypothetical interactions). Although
some evidence supports the idea that these interactions could exist in A. thaliana , they should
be corroborated with additional experimental examination.
Dynamic Gene Regulatory Network Model of A. thaliana Cell Cycle
PLOS Computational Biology | DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004486 September 4, 2015 18 / 28
Our model provides a dynamic explanation to the cyclic behavior of certain transcription
factors and predicts a novel interaction for E2F and MYB regulators; they connect waves of
periodic expression that seem to be key for the robust limit cycle attractor that characterizesCC behavior. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that such periodic transcription canbe maintained even in the absence of S-phase and mitotic cyclins [
4], which underpin the role
of a transcription factor network oscillator for the correct CC progression [ 137]. A regulatory
interaction between E2F and MYB factors (or among the equivalent regulators) may be con-served among other eukaryotes (e.g. mammals and yeast), but there is no experimental support
yet for it in A. thaliana . After looking for the same direct evidence in A. thaliana and not find-
ing it, we thought about an alternative regulatory mechanism that consists in transcription fac-tors acting between E2F and MYB. Hence, we decided to analyze the important transcription
factor families known so far, to find out if one of their members could be mediating the regula-
tion between E2F and MYB. The TCP (for Teosinte branched 1, Cycloidea, PCF) and the MYBfamily were chosen because they have been reported to be involved in CC regulation [
42].
Based on their gene expression patterns and promoter sequence analysis, MYB77 was our best
candidate: it is expressed at the beginning of M phase, and could be regulated by E2F and regu-lator of MYB (see
Table 1 ). A second possibility might be that several tissue-specific transcrip-
tion factors are involved in E2F-MYB genetic regulation (e.g. GL3, MYB88, SHR/SCR [ 17],
MYB59 [ 138] or even members of the MADS box gene family could be implied). Indeed, we
have recently documented that a MADS-box gene, XAL1, encodes a transcription factor thatregulates several CC components (García-Cruz et al., in preparation).
A. thaliana CC in comparison to animal and yeast CC
Differences among eukaryotic CCs allow us to recognize or characterize alternative mecha-
nisms for the regulation of CC. The first difference between GRN of A. thaliana CC and that of
other eukaryotes, concerns the number of duplicates of some key regulators. A. thaliana has up
to ten copies of some of the genes that encode for CC regulators (e.g. families of cyclins or
CDK), while yeast, mammals or the algae Ostreococcus tauri , have much fewer duplicates [ 20,
139 –141]. The only exception concerns the homologues of Retinoblastoma protein, of which
there are three members in humans and mouse, and only one copy in A. thaliana [127]. Future
models should address the explicit role of CC duplicated components in the plastic response of
plant development to environmental conditions. Being sessile, such developmental adjust-ments, as plants grow under varying environments, are expected to be more important, com-
plex and dynamic than in motile yeast and animals. One possibility is that different members
of the same gene family are linked to different transduction pathways of signals that modulateCC dynamics.
The second difference among A. thaliana and other CC was regarding the transcriptional
regulation throughout the GRN underlying it. For instance, S. cerevisiae does not have RBR or
E2F homologues, but instead has Whi5, Swi4,6 and Mbp1 proteins which perform equivalent
regulatory functions to the former CC components [
142,143].S. cerevisiae does not have any
MYB transcription factors but it presents other transcriptional regulators, such as Fkh1/2,Ndd1 and Mcm1 [
142,144,145], which regulate the G2/M transition in a similar way to MYBs
in mammals.
Contrary to the conservation in G1/S transition [ 15,67], molecular components controlling
G2/M transition seem to vary among different eukaryotes. It seems that molecules such asWEE1 kinase and CDC25 phosphatase are not conserved. In A. thaliana , CDC25-like has
phosphatase and arsenate-reductase functions [
146], while A. thaliana WEE1 phosphorylates
monomeric CDKA;1 in vitro [147], and Nicotiana tabacum WEE1 inhibits CDK activity in
Dynamic Gene Regulatory Network Model of A. thaliana Cell Cycle
PLOS Computational Biology | DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004486 September 4, 2015 19 / 28
vitro [148]. However the lack of any obvious mutant phenotype of CDC25 or WEE1 loss-of-
function mutants predicts that these genes are not involved in the regulation of a normal CC.
Additionally, although WEE1 has a role during DNA damage [ 146,149], does not seem to
have a CDKA;1 recognition domain [ 150]. CDC25-like does not have the required sites for
CDKA;1 recognition [ 150]. In summary, the positive regulatory feedback between CDKA;1
and CDC25-like, as well as the mutual-inhibitory feedback loop between CDKA;1 and WEE1,
seem not to be conserved in A. thaliana .
Given all that evidence for G2/M regulation, we integrated the regulatory interactions
between stoichiometric CDK inhibitor (KRP1), B-type plant specific CDK and MYB transcrip-
tional factors. It is not surprising that there are clear differences between plant G2 phase regula-tion and that of other organisms, because variations in this control point could define cell fate.
Although differences among the A. thaliana CC GRN uncovered here and that of yeasts and
animals have now become clear, we think that the basic regulatory CC module reported here,will be a useful framework to incorporate and discover new components of the CC GRNs in
plants and also in other eukaryotes.
Despite the fact that our CC GRN model recovers observed CC stage configurations and
their canonical pattern of temporal transitions, it did not recover an alternative attractor thatcorresponds to the endocycle. We hypothesize that the same multi-stable GRN underlies both
states, and additional components yet to be connected to the CC GRN will ensure a cyclic
attractor corresponding to the complete CC, and another one with shorter period correspond-ing to the endocycle. In its present form, our model suggests that CYCD3;1 function, which
has been associated with the proliferative state [
108] and with a delay in the endocycle onset
[23], is important to enter the endocycle. Besides, it also has been reported that CYCD3;1 plays
a role in G1/S transition [ 121] and regulates RBR protein during DNA replication [ 89]. Fur-
thermore, the endoreduplication attractor obtained in some of our mutant simulations (e.g. Fig
5A, 5C and 5D -right) also supports the role of CYCD3;1 in entering an endocycle.
The GRN model of A. thaliana CC could help to identify physiological or developmental
interactions involved in the tight relationship between proliferation and differentiation observed
during different stages of development [ 1,88,108,109,126]. Previous to cell division, the cell
senses its intracellular and environmental conditions to arrest or promote CC progress. Suchcues directly affect the CC machinery, which does not depend on a master or central regulator.
CC control is the result of a network formed by feedback and feedforward loops between
complexes of CDK-cyclin and its regulators. It is not evident how complex dynamical processessuch as CC progression emerge from simple interactions among components acting simulta-
neously. The proposed CC GRN will be very helpful to study how cell proliferation/differentia-
tion decisions and balance keeps a suitable spatio-temporal control of CC during plant growthand development.

Cellular decisions are determined by complex molecular interaction networks. Large-scale signaling networks are
currently being reconstructed, but the kinetic parameters and quantitative data that would allow for dynamic
modeling are still scarce. Therefore, computational studies based upon the structure of these networks are of greatinterest. Here, a methodology relying on a logical formalism is applied to the functional analysis of the complexsignaling network governing the activation of T cells via the T cell receptor, the CD4/CD8 co-receptors, and the
accessory signaling receptor CD28. Our large-scale Boolean model, which comprises 94 nodes and 123 interactions and
is based upon well-established qualitative knowledge from primary T cells, reveals important structural features (e.g.,feedback loops and network-wide dependencies) and recapitulates the global behavior of this network for an array of
published data on T cell activation in wild-type and knock-out conditions. More importantly, the model predicted
unexpected signaling events after antibody-mediated perturbation of CD28 and after genetic knockout of the kinaseFyn that were subsequently experimentally validated. Finally, we show that the logical model reveals key elements
and potential failure modes in network functioning and provides candidates for missing links. In summary, our large-
scale logical model for T cell activation proved to be a promising in silico tool, and it inspires immunologists to ask newquestions. We think that it holds valuable potential in foreseeing the effects of drugs and network modifications.

Introduction
Understanding how cellular networks function in a holistic
perspective is the main purpose of systems biology [1].Dynamic models provide an optimal basis for a detailed studyof cellular networks and have been applied successfully tocellular networks of moderate size [2–5]. However, for theirconstruction and analysis they require an enormous amountof mechanistic details and quantitative data which, until now,
has been often lacking in large-scale networks. Therefore,
there has been considerable effort to develop methods basedexclusively on the often well-known network topology [6,7].One may distinguish between studies on the statisticalproperties of graphs [8–10 ] and approaches aiming at
predicting functional or dysfunctional states and modes.
For the latter, a large corpus of methods has been developed
for metabolic networks mainly relying on the constraints-based approach [11,12]. However, for signaling networks,methods facilitating a similar functional analysis—includingpredictions on the outcome of interventions— have beenapplied to a much lesser extent [6].
Here we demonstrate that capturing the structure of
signaling networks by a recently introduced logical approach[13] allows the analysis of important functional aspects, often
leading to predictions that can be veriﬁed in knock-out/
perturbation experiments. Logical networks have until nowbeen used for studying artiﬁcial (random) networks [14] orrelatively small gene regulatory networks [15–18]. In contrast,herein we study a large-scale signaling network, structured ininput (e.g., receptors), intermediate, and output (e.g., tran-scription factors) layers. Compared with gene regulatory
networks, the behavior of signaling networks is mainlygoverned by their input layer, shifting the interest to input–
output relationships. Addressing these issues requires parti-
ally different techniques, as compared with gene regulatory
networks. We use a special and intuitive representation of
logical networks (called logical interaction hypergraph (LIH); see
Methods), which is well-suited for this kind of input–output
analysis. By applying logical steady state analysis, one may
predict how a combination of signals arriving at the inputlayer leads to a certain response in the intermediate and the
output layers. Additionally, this approach facilitates predic-
tions of the effect of interventions and, moreover, allows one
to search for interventions that repress or provoke a certain
logical response [13]. Furthermore, each logical network has a
unique underlying interaction graph from which other
important network properties such as feedback loops,
signaling paths, and network-wide interdependencies can be
evaluated.

Importantly, we consider here a logical model to be
constructed by collecting and integrating well-known local
interactions (e.g., a kinase phosphorylates an adaptor
molecule). The logical model is then employed to deriveglobal information (e.g., stimulation of a receptor leads to the
activation of a certain transcription factor via several logical
connections). Thus, the available data on the global network
behavior is not used to construct the model; instead, it is usedtoverify the model. The model may then be employed to
predict global responses that have not yet been studied
experimentally.
Here, we apply the logical framework to a carefully
constructed model of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. T-lymphocytes play a key role within the immune system:cytotoxic, CD8
þ, T cells destroy cells infected by viruses or
malignant cells, and CD4þT helper cells coordinate the
functions of other cells of the immune system [19]. Theimportance of T cells for immune homeostasis is due to theirability to speciﬁcally recognize foreign, potentially danger-ous, agents and, subsequently, to initiate a speciﬁc immune
response. T cell reactivity must be exquisitely regulated as
either a decrease (which weakens the defense againstpathogens with the consequence of immunodeﬁciency) oran increase (which can lead to autoimmune disorders and
leukemia) can have severe consequences for the organism.
T cells detect foreign antigens by means of the TCR, which
recognizes peptides only when presented upon MHC (MajorHistocompatibility Complex) molecules. The peptides thatare recognized by the TCR are typically derived from foreign
(e.g., bacterial, viral) proteins and are generated by proteo-
lytic cleavage within so-called antigen presenting cells (APCs).Binding of the TCR to peptide/MHC complexes and theadditional binding of a different region of the MHC
molecules by the co-receptors (CD4 in the case of T helper
cells and CD8 in the case of cytotoxic T cells), together withcostimulatory molecules such as CD28, initiates a plethora ofsignaling cascades within the T cell. These cascades give riseto a complex signaling network, which controls the activation
of several transcription factors. These transcription factors,in turn, control the cell’s fate, particularly whether the T cellbecomes activated and proliferates or not [20]. Therefore, we
chose to focus on a limited number of receptors that are
known to be central to the decision making process. The highnumber of kinases, phosphatases, adaptor molecules, andtheir interactions give rise to a complex interaction network
which cannot be interpreted via pure intuition and requires
the aid of mathematical tools. Since no sufﬁcient basis ofkinetic data is available for setting up a dynamic model of this
network, we opted to use logical modeling as a qualitative and
discrete modeling framework. Note that there are kineticmodels dealing with a smaller part of the network (e.g.,[5,21,22]), as well as models of the gene regulatory network
governing T cell activation [23].
We recently introduced our approach for the logical
modeling of signaling networks [13], and, to exemplify it, we
presented a small logical model for T cell activation (40nodes). However, this model only served to demonstrateapplicability and was too incomplete to address realistic
complex input–output patterns. In contrast, the model
presented herein has been signiﬁcantly expanded to 94 nodesand reﬁned by a careful reconstruction process (see below). Itis thus realistic enough to be veriﬁed with diverse exper-
imental data and to test its predictive power.
In this report, the large-scale logical model describing T
cell activation and the analysis performed therewith will be
presented. First we will show that a number of importantstructural features can be identiﬁed with this model. Then wewill show that the model not only reproduces published data
on wet lab experiments, but it also predicts non-intuitive and
previously unknown responses.
Results
Setup of a Curated, Comprehensive Logical Model of T
Cell Receptor Signaling
We have constructed a logical model describing T cell
signaling (see Methods and Figure 1), which comprises themain events and elements connecting the TCR, its corecep-
tors CD4/CD8, and the costimulatory molecule CD28, to the
activation of key transcription factors in T cells such as AP-1,NFAT, and NF jB, all of which determine T cell activation and
T cell function. In general, the model includes the following
signaling steps emerging from the above receptors: the
activation of the Src kinases Lck and Fyn, followed by theactivation of the Syk-related protein tyrosine kinase ZAP70,and the subsequent assembly of the LAT signalosome, which
in turn triggers activation of PLC c1, calcium cascades,
activation of RasGRP, and Grb2/SOS, leading to the activa-tion of MAPKs [20]. Additionally, it includes the activation ofthe PI3K/PKB pathway that regulates many aspects of cellular
activation and differentiation, particularly survival. For the
activation of elements that play an important role, but whoseregulation is not well-known yet (e.g., Card11, Gadd45), anexternal input was added. These elements can be considered
as points of future extension of the model.
As mentioned above, our model, which is documented in a
detailed manner in Tables S1 and S2, is based upon local
interactions (e.g., kinase ZAP70 phosphorylates the adaptormolecule LAT) that are well-established for primary T cells in

Author Summary
T-lymphocytes are central regulators of the adaptive immune
response, and their inappropriate activation can cause autoimmunediseases or cancer. The understanding of the signaling mechanismsunderlying T cell activation is a prerequisite to develop new
strategies for pharmacological intervention and disease treatments.
However, much of the existing literature on T cell signaling is relatedto T cell development or to activation processes in transformed Tcell lines (e.g., Jurkat), whereas information on non-transformed
primary T cells is limited. Here, immunologists and theoreticians
have compiled data from the existing literature that stem fromanalysis of primary T cells. They used this information to establish a
qualitative Boolean network that describes T cell activation
mechanisms after engagement of the TCR, the CD4/CD8 co-receptors, and CD28. The network comprises 94 nodes and can beextended to facilitate interpretation of new data that emerge from
experimental analysis of T cell activation. Newly developed tools and
methods allow in silico analysis, and manipulation of the networkand can uncover hidden/unforeseen signaling pathways. Indeed, byassessing signaling events controlled by CD28 and the protein
tyrosine kinase Fyn, we show that computational analysis of even a
qualitative network can provide new and non-obvious signalingpathways which can be validated experimentally.A Logical Model of T Cell Receptor Signaling
the literature. We did not use the known global information
(e.g., stimulation of a receptor leads to the activation of acertain transcription factor) for the model construction.
Instead, in simulations, the local interactions give rise to a
global behavior which can be compared with availableexperimental observations (and was thus used to verify the
model).
Each component in the logical model can be either ON
(‘‘1’’) or OFF ( ‘‘0’’). We consider a compound to be ON only if
it is fully activated and able to trigger downstream eventsproperly; otherwise, it is OFF. Furthermore, we consider twotimescales [13]: early ( s¼1) and late ( s¼2), involving
processes occurring during or after the ﬁrst minutes of
activation, respectively (the time-scale for each interaction is
given in Table S2). Some key regulatory processes such as thedegradation of signaling proteins mediated by the E3ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl [24–26] occur after a certain time,and are thus assigned s¼2. Therefore, as will be shown later,
analysis of signal propagation during the early events reveals
which elements become activated, and the consideration of
the late events allows a rough approximation to the dynamicbehavior (sustained versus transient) of the network.
The model comprises 94 different compounds and 123
interactions that give rise to a complex map of interactions
(Figure 1). It is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest
Boolean model of a cellular network to date.
Interaction-Graph-Based Analyses
The ﬁrst step in our analysis was to examine the interaction
graph underlying the logical model. The former can be easilyderived from the latter when a special representation of
Boolean networks is used (see Methods). The interaction
graph is less constrained than the Boolean network since itonly captures direct (positive or negative) effects of one

Each arrow pointing at a species box is a so-called hyperarc representing one possibility to activate that species (see Methods). All the hyperarcs po inting
at a particular species box are OR connected. Yellow species boxes denote output elements, while green ones represent (co)receptors. In the shown
‘‘early-event ’’scenario, the feedback loops were switched off, and only the input for the costimulatory molecule CD28 is active (scenario in column 2 of
Table 1). The resulting logical steady state was then computed. Small text boxes display the signal flows along the hyperarcs (blue boxes: fixed value s
prior to computation; green boxes: hyperarcs activating a species (signal flow is 1); red boxes: hyperarcs which are not active (signal flow is 0)).

A Logical Model of T Cell Receptor Signaling
molecule upon another. Thus, unlike the logical model, the
interaction graph cannot describe how different causal
effects converging at a certain species are combined. For
example, in an interaction graph we may say that A and Bhave a positive inﬂuence on another node C; the logical
network is more precise because it expresses that A AND B
(or A OR B) are required to activate C. Accordingly,
compared with the logical model, an interaction graph
requires less a priori knowledge about the network understudy which comes at the price that functional predictions
are limited. Nevertheless, as demonstrated in this section, a
number of important functional features can be revealed
from the graph model.
First we studied global properties of the graph. As
expected, the graph is connected (i.e., neglecting the arc
directions, there is always a path from one node to all others).However, the directed graph contains as a core one strongly
connected component with 33 nodes (i.e., for each pair ( a,b)
of nodes taken from this component there is a path from ato
band from btoa). This structural organization is related with
the bow-tie structure found in other cellular networks (e.g.,[7,27]) and implies that the rest of the network (not contained
in the strongly connected component) mainly consists in
relatively simple input and output layers (including branch-
ing cascades) feeding to and from this component.
We continued the interaction-graph-based analysis by
computing the feedback loops. Feedback loops are of major
importance for the dynamic behavior and functioning ofbiological networks. Negative feedback loops control homeo-
static response and can give rise to oscillations, while positive
feedbacks govern multistable behavior (connected to irrever-
sible decision-making and differentiation processes) [15,28–
30]. The interaction graph underlying the logical T cell modelhas 172 feedback loops, 89 thereof being negative. Remark-
ably, all feedback loops are only active in the second timescale
because each loop contains at least one process of the second
timescale. The elements of the MAPK cascade are involved in
92% of the feedback loops. This is due to the fact that there is
a connection from ERK to the phosphatase SHP1 from the
bottom to the top of the network [5]. Due to this connection,the resulting feedback can return to ERK via many different
paths, thereby leading to a high number of loops. Indeed, if
the ERK !SHP1 connection is not considered, the number
of loops is reduced dramatically from 172 to 13 (with only 11
being negative), all located in the upper part of the network.c-Cbl is involved in ;85% of them, thus underscoring the
importance of c-Cbl in the regulation of signaling processes
[25,26].
There are 4,538 paths, each connecting one of the three
compounds from the input layer (TCR, CD4/CD8, CD28) with
one compound in the output layer (transcription factors and
other elements controlling T cell activation). The highnumber of negative paths (2,058) can be traced back to the
presence of two negative connections (via DGK and Gab2). In
fact, considering the early signaling events within the
network, where DGK and Gab2 are not active yet, the
number of paths is reduced to 1,530, with only six of them
being negative. These paths are from the TCR and CD28 to
negative regulators of the cell cycle (p21, p27, and FKHR),having thus a positive effect on T cell proliferation. These
and other global effects can be graphically inspected via the
dependency matrix [13,31], depicted in Figure 2. Importantly,when considering the timescale s¼1, there is no ambivalent
effect (i.e., via positive and negative paths) between any
ordered pair (A,B) of species, i.e., A is either a pure activatorof B (only positive paths from A to B), or a pure inhibitor of B
(only negative paths from A to B), or has no direct or indirect
inﬂuence on B at all. For example, during early activation, theTCR can only have a positive effect upon AP1 (the array
element (TCRb, AP1) in Figure 2 is green). Note that this
changes for timescale s¼2 where, in several cases, a
compound inﬂuences another species in an ambivalentmanner.
Analysis of the Logical Model
An important aspect that can be studied with a logical
model is signal processing and signal propagation and thecorresponding response (activation/inactivation) of the nodes
upon external stimuli and perturbations (see Methods). One
starts the analysis of a scenario by deﬁning a pattern of inputstimuli, possibly in combination with a set of nodes that areknocked-out or knocked-in. Then, by an iterative evaluation
of the Boolean rules in each node, the signal is propagated
through the network, switching each node ON or OFF,respectively (see [13] and Methods). For example, since CD28(an input) is (permanently) ON in the scenario shown in
Figure 1, it will (permanently) activate node X, which will in
turn (permanently) activate Vav1, and so forth. In the samescenario, since the input CD4 is OFF, Lckp1 and therefore
Abl, ZAP70, and other components cannot become activated
and therefore are in the OFF state. In the ideal case, eachnode can be assigned a uniquely determined state that followsfrom a given input pattern. In terms of Boolean networks, the
set of determined node values then represents a logical steady
state. In some cases, in particular when negative feedbackloops are active, only a fraction of the elements can beassigned a unique steady state value, whereas other (or even
all) nodes might oscillate [15]. However, since in the T cell
model all negative feedback loops become active only duringtimescale s¼2 (as described above), a complete logical steady
state follows for arbitrary input patterns when considering s
¼1.
Using this kind of logical steady state analysis, we ﬁrst
analyzed the activation pattern of key elements upon differ-ent stimuli (activation of the TCR and/or CD4 and/or CD28;Table 1) for timescale s¼1. The model was able to reproduce
data from both the literature and our own experiments,
providing a holistic and integrated interpretation for a largebody of data. The model also predicted a non-obvious
signaling event, namely that the activation of the costimula-
tory molecule CD28 alone leads not only to the activation ofPI3K—which is to be expected from a large body of literaturedealing with CD28 signaling showing that PI3K binds to the
motif YxxM of CD28 [32,33]—but also to the selective
activation of JNK, but not ERK. The model predicts apathway from CD28 to JNK which gives a holistic explanationfor this result: the pathway does NOT involve the LAT
signalosome, activation of PLC c1, and Calcium ﬂux, but
clearly depends on the activation of the nucleotide exchangefactor Vav1 which activates MEKK1 via the small G-protein
Rac1 (Figure 1). Clearly, the activating pathway shown in
Figure 1 could be identiﬁed by a visual inspection of the map(note that we have intentionally drawn the network in such away that this route can be easily seen). However, in large-scale

A Logical Model of T Cell Receptor Signaling
networks the identiﬁcation of long-distance pathways by
simply following all possible routes becomes infeasible and is
particularly complicated if AND connections are involved.
Furthermore, since the CD28-induced JNK activation path-
way was not expected, one would probably not have searched
speciﬁcally for this pathway, while the algorithm reveals the
whole response of the network.
The prediction made by the model is particularly surpris-
ing in light of published data which either suggest that CD28
stimulation alone does NOT activate JNK [34,35] or induces
only a weak activation [36]. Driven by this surprising
prediction, we performed the corresponding experiments in
vitro. As shown in Figure 3A, stimulation of mouse primary T
cells with a non-superagonistic CD28 antibody induced an
evident and sustained JNK phosphorylation, thus conﬁrming
almost perfectly the predicted binary response. Note, the
model also predicted that JNK activation does not depend on
the activation of PI3K. Again, this prediction was veriﬁed by
applying a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K (Figure 3D).The discrepancies with the literature could be due either to
the different cellular systems (primary T cells versus T cell
lines) or to the different stimulation conditions.
The nature of the kinase involved in CD28-mediatedsignaling remains unclear. Indeed, application of the Src-
kinase inhibitor PP2 that inactivates both Lck þFyn [37],
showed that Src-kinases, which were proposed to mediate
CD28 signaling [38], are dispensable for the CD28-mediated
activation of JNK (Figure 4). To ﬁt the Src-kinase inhibitor
data with the model, it would have been possible to simply
bypass the Src-kinase and to draw a causal connection from
CD28 to Vav. Such a connection would indeed be justiﬁed
since it is well established that triggering of CD28 leads to the
activation of Vav ([39]; for more details, see Table S2,
reactions 35 and 48). However, we preferred to include a
to-be-identiﬁed kinase X that gets activated by CD28 (Figure
1), in order to keep within the model the information that
there is a component to be identiﬁed. Potential candidates
for kinase X would be members of the Tec-family of PTKs.
However, it is difﬁcult to study the signaling properties of
these kinases in primary non-transformed cells since speciﬁc
inhibitors for Tec kinases are not yet available and the
corresponding knock-out mi ce show defects in thymic
development. Therefore, as we focused during model
generation on well-established data from primary T cells
and excluded data obtained from knockout mice showing
alterations of thymic development, we did not include it.Figure 2. Dependency Matrix of the Logical T Cell Signaling Model (Figure 1) for the Early Events Scenario ( s¼1)

A Logical Model of T Cell Receptor Signaling
The ability of the model to recapitulate the T cell
phenotype of a variety of previously described knock-out
mice was also tested (Table 1). Indeed, the model could
reproduce the phenotype of several knock-outs and againreported a rather unexpected result: activation of the TCR inFyn-deﬁcient cells selectively triggers the PI3K/PKB pathway.
This prediction was subsequently tested using peripheral
primary T cells prepared from spleen of Fyn-deﬁcient mice.As shown in Figure 3B, the wet-lab experiments corroboratedthe model result again.
However, there was an experimental result which the
model could not reproduce: TCR-mediated JNK activation is
blocked by an inhibitor of PI3K (Figure 3C). In fact, this resultis not in accordance with the network because PI3K has noinﬂuence upon JNK (see dependency matrix, Figure 2).
To identify potential connections that would explain the
experimental data, we applied the concept of Minimal
Intervention Sets (MISs; see Methods). A MIS is a irreduciblecollection of actions (e.g., activation or inactivation of certaincompounds), that, if applied, guarantees that a certain goal (adesired behavior) is fulﬁlled [13]. Here, we computed the MISs
by which JNK becomes activated under the experimentallyobtained constraint (see Figure 3C) that PI3K is OFF
(describing the effect of the PI3K inhibitor), ZAP70 is ON,
and that the TCR has been activated. These MISs (Table 2)thus provide a list of minimal combinations of elements thatshould be directly or indirectly affected by PI3K and thusallow us to explain the observed response of JNK upon
inhibiting PI3K. Some of them are obvious, e.g., the ﬁrst MIS
in Table 2 suggests that JNK activation could be directlyinteracting with PI3K or elements that are located down-stream of PI3K (e.g., PIP3). There is currently no convincingexperimental evidence for an effect of PI3K on JNK, though.Other MISs in Table 2 suggest that a PI3K-mediated activation
of Vav (both 1 and 3 isoforms) is involved, which would be an
attractive possibility to exp lain the experimental data.
Indeed, Vav possesses a PH domain which can bind to PIP3,and this mechanism could be important for Vav activation[40], thus making it a reasonable extension of the model.

A Logical Model of T Cell Receptor Signaling
activation of JNK is the serine/threonine kinase HPK1 (see
Figure 1 and Tables S1 and S2). Interestingly, HPK1 is
phosphorylated by Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1) [41], a kinase
whose activation depends on PKC (which in turn is depend-
ent on DAG, downstream of PI3K) for activation. Since the
regulation and functional roles of both PKD1 and PKC (with
the exception of the hisoform) are not yet well-established in
T cells, we did not include them in the model, but aconnection PI3K !PIP3!Itk!PLC c!DAG!PKC!
PKD1!HPK1 would be plausible (in which the path from
PKC to HPK1 via PKD1 would be new). An alternative could
be a Rac-dependent activation of HPK1 [42]; however, this is
again a not-well-established connection and thus was not
considered.
Deﬁnitely, the model requires a direct or indirect
connection from PI3K to JNK, and additional experimentsare required to assess which of the candidate links predicted
by the MISs are relevant in peripheral T cells. This particularexample illustrates another useful and important application
of our approach: the model not only reveals that a link is
missing, but also suggests candidates that can be veriﬁedexperimentally. Thus, MIS analysis is capable of guiding theexperimentalist and helps to plan the corresponding experi-ments.
As an additional application of MISs, we computed
combinations of failures (constitutive activation or inactiva-
tion of elements caused for example by mutations) which lead
to sustained T cell activation without external stimuli. Thesefailure modes would cause uncontrolled proliferation andthus may be connected to diseases such as leukemia orautoimmunity. Interestingly, components occurring in theMISs with few elements (Table 3) are in fact known
oncogenes: ZAP70 [43], PI3K [44], Gab2 [45], and PLC c1
[46] (and SLP76 is directly involved in PLC c1 activation).
Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis of the Logical Model
Strongly related to the idea of MISs is a systematic
evaluation of the network response if the model is confrontedwith failures. By considering a failure as something that
happens to the cell by an internal or external event (e.g., a
mutation), we may assess the robustness —one of the most
important properties of living systems [47]—of the network.In contrast, if we consider the failure as an error that hasbeen introduced during the modeling process (due toincomplete knowledge), then we are assessing the sensitivity
of the model with respect to the predictions it makes.
Accordingly, to study robustness and sensitivity issues, we (i)removed systematically each single interaction from thenetwork, (ii) recomputed the scenarios given in Table 1, and(iii) compared the new predictions with the 126 originalpredictions (Table 1), ranking the interactions according to
the number of introduced changes produced (Table 4). As an
average value, 4.76 errors were introduced per simulatedfailure, which corresponds to 3.78% of the total numbers ofpredictions. The most sensitive interactions are mainlylocated in the upper part of the network and activate
components such as the T cell receptor (TCRb), ZAP70,
LAT, Fyn, or Abl. It is intuitively clear that the network is very
Figure 4. In Vitro Analysis of Src-Kinase Inhibition
Inhibition of Src-Kinases (Lck and Fyn) with PP2 blocks TCR-induced but affects only moderately CD28-induced PKB and JNK activation in human T cells;
therefore, we concluded that CD28 signaling is not strictly Src-kinase– dependent. The effect was compared with PI3K inhibition via Wortmannin (ccf .
Figure 3C and 3D), which blocks the phosphorylation of PKB but not of JNK. b-actin was included as the loading control. One representative experiment
(of three) is shown.

A Logical Model of T Cell Receptor Signaling
sensitive to failures (again, caused either by internal/external
events or modeling errors) in these upper nodes because all
pathways branching downstream are governed by them.
Accordingly, the validation of our model (with the data fromTable 1) is most sensitive to modeling errors in the upper partof the network. We also note that species that can beactivated by more than one interaction (e.g., PI3K) aresigniﬁcantly less sensitive to single interaction failures sincealternative pathways exist. Regarding robustness, it is worthemphasizing that in the worst case about 30% of the originalpredictions are affected after removal of an interaction,
indicating that there is no ‘‘all-or-nothing ’’interaction in the
network.
We have also performed the same analysis for the removal
of a species (instead of an interaction) which basically led tothe same results (unpublished data). However, the removal ofa node can be seen as a stronger intervention in the network
than deleting an interaction, as the former simulates the
simultaneous removal of all interactions pointing at thatspecies. Accordingly, deleting nodes implies some strongerdeviations from the original predictions.
Qualitative Description of the Dynamics
So far we have analyzed which elements within the
signaling network get activated upon signal triggering (i.e.,for the ﬁrst timescale s¼1). This is due to the fact that a large
corpus of data for these conditions is available (see Table 1).
However, it is important to note that the model is also able toroughly predict the dynamics upon different stimuli andconditions.
The modus operandi goes as follows: ﬁrst, one computes
the steady state values with no external input ( s¼0).
Subsequently, the steady state for s¼1 is computed as
described above. Finally, one computes the state of the ‘‘slow ’’
interactions (those only active at s¼2) as a function of the
values at s¼1, and subsequently recomputes the steady states.
This provides the response at late events, s¼2. The results
obtained can be plotted in a time-dependent manner (Figure5). Here, one can also investigate the effect of differentknock-outs. For example, the absence of PAG has no effect on
key downstream elements of the cascade, due to the
redundant role of other negative regulatory mechanisms(speciﬁcally, the degradation via c-Cbl and Cbl-b, and Gab-2–mediated inhibition of PLC c1). Only a multiple knock-out of
these regulatory molecules leads to sustained activation of
key elements. Thus, these results point to a certain degree of
redundancy in negative feedbacks for switching off signaling.
This sort of qualitative analysis of the dynamics shows the
ability of the Boolean approach to reproduce the key
dynamic properties (transient versus sustained) of a signalingprocess.

A Logical Model of T Cell Receptor Signaling
comprehensive Boolean model describing T cell signaling and
performed logical steady state analyses unraveling the
processing of signals and the global input–output behavior.
Moreover, by converting the logical model into an interaction
graph, we extracted further important features, such asfeedback loops, signaling paths, and network-wide interde-
pendencies. The latter can be captured in a dependency
matrix (as in Figure 2) which provides thousands of
qualitative predictions that can be falsiﬁed in perturbation
experiments. The logical model reproduces the global
behavior of this complex network for both natural and
perturbed conditions (knock-outs, inhibitors, mutations, etc.).Its validity has been proven by reproducing published data
and by predicting unexpected results that were then veriﬁed
experimentally. Table 1 summarizes the results of 14 different
scenarios, in which the logical model predicted 126 states. For
44 of them, experimental data was available (15 fromliterature and 29 from our own experiments) conﬁrming
the predictions, except in the case discussed above.
Furthermore, we clearly show that the concept of inter-vention sets allows one (a) to identify missing links in the
network, (b) to reveal failure modes that can explain the
effects of a physiological dysfunction or disease, and (c) to
search for suitable intervention strategies, while keeping
track of potential side effects, which is valuable for drug
target identiﬁcation.
Compared with a kinetic model based on differential
equations, a Boolean approach is certainly limited regarding
the analysis of quantitative and dynamical aspects, and it
certainly cannot answer the same questions. However, to
establish such a model requires mainly the topology and only
a relatively small amount of quantitative data; hence, acombination of information which is currently available in
large-scale networks. Although the model itself is qualitative
(i.e., discrete), it enables us not only to study qualitative
aspects of signaling networks, but it can also be validated by
semi-quantitative measurements such as those in Figures 3
and 4. In summary, with the network involved in T cell
activation as a case study, our approach proved to be a
Figure 5. Considering Different Time Scales, a Rough Description of the Dynamics Can Be Obtained
The activation of key elements upon activation of the TCR, the coreceptor CD4, and the costimulatory molecule CD28 is represented at the resting state ,
s¼0 (no inputs); early events s¼1 (input(s), no feedback loops); and later-time events, s¼2 (input(s), feedback loops). The black lines correspond to a
wild type while the green ones to a PAG KO. Note that the absence of PAG has no effect on key downstream elements of the cascade, due to theredundant role of other negative regulatory mechanisms (degradation via c-Cbl and Cbl-b, Gab-2 mediated inhibition of PLC c1). Multiple knock-out of
these regulatory molecules leads to sustained activation of key elements (red lines).

A Logical Model of T Cell Receptor Signaling
promising in silico tool for the analysis of a large signaling
network, and we think that it holds valuable potential inforeseeing the effects of drugs and network modiﬁcations.
Although sometimes the results of a logical model may
(afterward) appear to be obvious (as in the case of the CD28-mediated JNK connection), it enables an exhaustive andrigorous analysis of the information processing taking placewithin a signaling network. Such a systematic analysis
becomes infeasible for a human being in large-scale systems.In addition, the LIH can represent the situation of varyingcofactor functions; for example, that two substances A AND Bare required to activate a third substance C, but activation ofC in the presence of A and a fourth substance D requires Bnot to be present.
Certainly, the logical model for T cell activation is far from
complete. We are just at the beginning of the reconstructionprocess and other receptors and their pathways need to beincluded. However, we feel that already in its current state,the model may prove useful to inspire immunologists to asknew questions which may ﬁrst be answered in silico.Furthermore, the model may also provide a framework forthose who may endeavor to quantitatively model TCRsignaling.
Methods
Logical network representation and analysis. We began construc-
tion of the signaling network for primary T cells by collecting datafrom the literature and from our own experiments providing well-established connections (Tables S1 and S2). As a ﬁrst (intermediate)
result, we obtain an interaction graph. Interaction graphs are signed
directed graphs with the molecules (such as receptor, phosphatase, ortranscription factor) as nodes and signed arcs denoting the directinﬂuence of one species upon another, which can either be activating(þ) or inhibiting ( /C0). For example, a positive arc leads from MEK to
ERK because the ﬁrst phosphorylates and thereby activates thesecond (Figure 1). From the incidence matrix of an interaction graphwe can identify important features such as feedback loops as well assignaling paths and network-wide interdependencies between pairsof species (e.g., perturbing A may have no effect on B as there is nopath connecting A to B). Algorithms related to these analyses arewell-known [48] and were recently presented in the context ofsignaling networks [13]. However, from interaction graphs we cannotconclude which combinations of signals reaching a species along the
arcs are required to activate that species. For example, in Figure 1,
Jun AND Fos are required to form active AP1.
For a reﬁned representation of such relationships, we use a logical
(or Boolean) model in which we introduce discrete states for the
species (here the simplest (binary) case: 0 ¼inactive or not present; 1
¼active or present) and assign to each species a Boolean function.
Here we use a special representation of Boolean functions known asdisjunctive normal form (DNF, also called ‘‘sum of product ’’
representation) which uses exclusively AND, OR, and NOT oper-ators. A Boolean network with Boolean functions in disjunctivenormal form can be intuitively drawn and stored as a hypergraph(LIH) [13], which is well-suited for studying the information ﬂowsand input–output relationships in signal transduction networks(Figure 1). In this hypergraph, each hyperarc connects its start nodeswith an AND operation (indicated by a blue circle in Figure 1) andeach hyperarc represents one possibility for how its end node can beactivated or produced (note that hyperacs may also have only onestart node, i.e., they are then ‘‘graph-like ’’arcs). Red branches
indicate species that enter the hyperarc with their negated value. For
example, PLC c-1 (PLCga in Figure 1) AND NOT DGK activates DAG
(see Figure 1). Note that each LIH has a unique underlyinginteraction graph (which can be easily derived from the LIHrepresentation by splitting the AND connections), whereas theopposite is, in general, not true.
Within this logical framework we may study the effect of a set of
input stimuli (typically ligands) on downstream signaling by comput-ing the logical steady state [13] that results by propagating the signalsthrough the network from the input to the output layer. It seemsworthwhile to remark that the updating assumption (synchronous
versus asynchronous [14,15])—which must usually be made whendealing with dynamic Boolean networks—is not relevant here as wefocus on the logical steady states, which are equivalent in both cases.
Sometimes a logical steady state is not unique or does not exist due to
the presence of feedbacks loops. However, many feedback loopsbecome active only in a longer timescale justifying setting them OFFin the ﬁrst wave of signal propagation (allowing them to be switched
ON for the second timescale). This has been used here for several
feedback loops (see main text and Table S2). The effect of knocking-out a species can be tested by re-computing the (new) logical steadystate for the respective stimuli. MISs satisfying a given interventiongoal can be computed by systematically testing sets of permanently
activated or/and deactivated nodes [13,31].
All mathematical analyses and computations have been performed
with our software tool CellNetAnalyzer [31], a comprehensive user

Immunoblotting. Human or mouse T cells were puriﬁed using an
AutoMACS magnetic isolation system according to the manufac-turer’s instructions (Miltenyi, http://www.miltenyibiotec.com). Mouse
T cells were stimulated with 10 lg/ml of biotinylated CD3 e(a subunit
of the TCR) antibody (145–2C11, BD Biosciences, http://www.bdbiosciences.com/), 10 lg/ml of biotinylated CD28 antibody (37.51,
BD Biosciences), CD3 plus CD28 mAbs, or with CD3 plus 10 lg/ml of
biotinylated CD4 (GK1.5, BD Biosciences) followed by crosslinking
with 25 lg/ml of streptavidin (Dianova, http://www.dianova.de) at 37
8C for the indicated periods of time. Human T cells were stimulated
with CD3 emAb MEM92 (IgM, kindly provided by Dr. V. Horejsi,
Prague, Czech Republic) or with CD3 plus CD28 mAbs (248.23.2).
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% NP-40, 1% laurylmaltoside
(N-dodecyl b-D-maltoside), 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 10mM
EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na

separated by SDS/PAGE, transferred onto membranes, and blotted
with the following antibodies: anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), anti-
ERK1/2 (pT202/pT204), anti-JNK (pT183/pY185), anti-phospho-Akt(S473) (all from Cell Signaling, http://www.cellsignal.com/), anti-ZAP70 (pTyr 319, Cell Signaling), anti-ZAP70 (cloneZ24820, Trans-
duction Laboratories, http://www.bdbiosciences.com/), or against b-
Actin (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/). Where PI3K and src-kinase inhibitors were used, T cells were treated with 100 nMWortmannin (Calbiochem, http://www.emdbiosciences.com) or 10 lM
PP2 (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 8C prior to stimulation. All
experiments have been repeated three times and reproduced the

Abstract
The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src and receptor tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) have
been established as collaborators in cellular signaling and their combined dysregulation plays key roles in human cancers,
including breast cancer. In part due to the complexity of the biochemical network associated with the regulation of these
proteins as well as their cellular functions, the role of Src in EGFR regulation remains unclear. Herein we present a newcomprehensive, multi-scale dynamical model of ErbB receptor signal transduction in human mammary epithelial cells. Thismodel, constructed manually from published biochemical literature, consists of 245 nodes representing proteins and their
post-translational modifications sites, and over 1,000 biochemical interactions. Using computer simulations of the model,
we find it is able to reproduce a number of cellular phenomena. Furthermore, the model predicts that overexpression of Srcresults in increased endocytosis of EGFR in the absence/low amount of the epidermal growth factor (EGF). Our subsequentlaboratory experiments also suggest increased internalization of EGFR upon Src overexpression under EGF-deprived
conditions, further supporting this model-generated hypothesis.

Introduction
EGF receptor (ErbB1) and other members of the ErbB family of
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play essential physiological rolesin development and maintenance of epithelial tissues by generat-
ing cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration signals
in response to specific ligands and via the stimulation of severalsignaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, MAPK, Src, as well asSTAT pathways [1,2]. Activation of ErbB receptors is also linkedto the initiation and progression of human cancers. Thus,elucidating signaling pathways that play critical roles in physio-logical and oncogenic signaling by the ErbB family of receptors isof substantial clinical significance [2–5]. Despite substantialprogress through experimental studies, in depth mechanisticanalyses of the signaling mechanisms of ErbB receptor familyhave been quite challenging due to the multiple interactionsbetween members of the family, the number of associated effectorpathways, and the complexity of regulatory mechanisms [6]. Inaddition to a multitude of positive signaling pathways triggered byErbB receptor activation, ErbB receptor signaling is also under
regulation by negative feedback mechanisms via receptor endo-
cytosis and recycling/degradation, and this mechanism is critical
for normal function [7]. The level of intricacy of the ErbB
signaling system is further multiplied by the fact that ErbB
signaling pathways are closely intertwined with a number of other
signaling pathways such as those downstream of integrins and G-
Protein-coupled Receptors [8]. Together, these complexities havehampered our basic understanding of ErbB receptor signaling and
our ability to develop treatments for diseases, such as breast
cancer, lung cancer, gliomas and others, associated with aberrant
ErbB receptor signaling.
An example of the complex biology of ErbB receptor signaling
that is highly relevant to their role in oncogenesis involves the non-
receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src. The c-Src kinase is overexpressed
or hyperactive in a range of human tumors, including breast
cancer where as many as 70% cases have been reported with c-Src
overexpression along with EGFR/ErbB1 or ErbB2, leading to
conjectures of possible synergy between Src and the ErbBs in

breast cancer [9]. Indeed, in rodent fibroblasts [9,10] and more
importantly in untransformed human mammary epithelial cells
[11] the overexpression of c-Src promotes ErbB1/EGFR-depen-dent oncogenic transformation. In particular, c-Src is a criticalcomponent in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation as well as
migration, invasion and metastasis via the regulation of a number
of signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, MAPK, as well as focaladhesion kinase (FAK) [12]. However, the interconnectivity ofpathways associated with c-Src and the ErbB signaling hashindered the determination of the mechanisms of ErbB-c-Src
synergy in cancer.
These difficulties represent an ideal example of the need for a
systems biology approach to ErbB receptor signaling. Because
ErbB1/EGFR has been extensively studied over the last several
decades, it is perhaps one of the best understood receptor tyrosinekinase systems; this makes it a good candidate for computationalmodeling [13]. Thus far, several EGFR-based computational
models have been created; these have been used in studies focusing
on receptor trafficking and endocytosis [14–17], ErbB dimeriza-tion [18–20], as well as the relationships between physiologicalresponses and the receptor activation dynamics [21–23]. Several
modeling efforts have also been made to better understand the
signaling events downstream of EGFR [18,24–28]. In addition,recent efforts also utilized a logical modeling approach to analyzethe topology and dynamics of an ErbB signaling network in
human liver cells [29], and to identify a potential new drug target,
c-MYC, in a model of ErbB receptor-mediated G1/S cell cycletransition [30].
In this work, a new comprehensive, multi-scale logical model of
signal transduction in a human mammary epithelial cell (hMEC) is
presented. This large-scale dynamical model consists of 245cellular components and about 1,100 biochemical interactions,and encompasses all ErbB receptor family members, including
individual receptor phosphorylation sites, as well as integrin, G-
protein-coupled receptor, and stress signaling pathways. Themodel was constructed manually by collecting and integratingbiochemical information from over 800 published papers. One of
the main advantages of logical models lies in their scalability; first,
they are based on qualitative information available for manycellular components across many cell types and do not depend onkinetic parameters (that are only sparsely available), and second,
simulations of logical models are relatively efficient [31,32],
making this approach appropriate for large systems.
Simulations of the model indicate a relatively accurate depiction
of the complexities of ErbB signaling by integrating a number of
other signaling pathways such as G-protein-coupled receptors(GPCR) and integrins. Following its validation, the model wasused to generate predictions about the role of c-Src in EGFRsignaling, which were verified experimentally in the laboratory.
Finally, the model (including its governing logical expressions as
well as all annotations) is available on-line in The Cell Collectivesoftware (www.thecellcollective.org; [32]) not only for download inmultiple open formats (e.g., SBML; [33]) , but also for live
simulations.
Results
1. The hMEC model
The hMEC model for EGFR signaling networks in a human
mammary epithelial cell was created by manually collecting
information on local biochemical interactions (e.g., protein-protein) from the primary literature (using the same methods asdescribed in [34]). All interactions and logical expressions have
been cataloged and annotated, and are available in the CellCollective software [32]. In addition, all representing logical
expressions are available in Supporting Information S1. The
model contains a number of integrated signaling pathways at thelevel of protein-protein as well as -post-translational (namelyphosphorylation) site interactions. These pathways include E-
cadherin, ErbB (1–4), ErbB1 (EGFR) endocytosis, G-protein-
coupled Receptor, integrin, and stress signaling pathways(Figure 1). Detailed description of some of these follows below.
ErbB receptors. All known individual ErbB receptors
(ErbB1–4), as well as the major ErbB receptor dimers wereincluded in the model. Moreover, the hierarchy of the dimeriza-
tion process [35] was also captured via the logical functions
associated with each receptor node in the model (see the Model
Validation section). Furthermore, this model goes into an even
greater detail; all major (auto) phosphorylation sites of the ErbB
receptors were included. This allows for a range of mutational
studies at the phosphorylation site level in future studies; forexample, this multi-scale property of the mode will enable in silico
simulations and analyses of system-wide effects of all theoretically
possible combinations of virtual knock-out studies of the mainphosphorylation sites in a single receptor as well as across all ErbBreceptors.
EGFR endocytosis. EGFR endocytosis as a potential mech-
anism of negative regulation through lysosomal degradation is
extremely important in relation to oncogenic signaling by ErbB
receptors [6]. Modeling receptor endocytosis is not trivial as thesame receptor can localize into different areas of the cell (e.g.,clathrin-coated (CC) pits, CC vesicles, endosome, etc.), depending
on its stage of the endocytic trafficking. The way these multiple
localizations are handled using our modeling framework is torepresent EGFR with multiple nodes depicting the receptor in thedifferent locations during endocytic traffic. Specifically, the
locations included in the model are the following: the plasma
membrane, clathrin-coated pits, clathrin-coated vesicles, earlyendosome, late endosome/multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and the
lysosome. The node representing EGFR in the lysosome denotes
the degradation process of EGFR. Because results from thesemodels do not attempt to predict exact measurements such asconcentrations of ligands used in laboratories, during a simulation,
the activity level associated with, for example, the node
representing EGFR in the lysosome corresponds to the degree of
EGFR being degraded in a semi-quantitative fashion. Further-more, the type of ligand which activates EGFR has an effect on
whether the receptor is recycled back to cell surface or degraded
upon its internalization. To be able to simulate these effects inaddition to the nodes representing the different localizations of thereceptor during endocytosis, nodes depicting the receptor being
activated by different types of ligands (using EGF or TGF aas
prototypes) were added. Thus there is a node that representsEGFR on the plasma membrane activated by EGF and a node forEGFR activated by TGF-alpha. While these differentiations add
complexity to the model, they allow the visualization and study of
the dynamics of the model in greater detail.
Drugs and Antibodies. Therapeutic agents that impact
ErbB receptor signaling and/or traffic, such as humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibodies Herceptin and Pertuzumab, as well
as small molecular inhibitors are included in the presented model.
These components allow the simulation of mutations known tocause cancer while at the same time introducing a number ofdifferent levels and combinations of drugs and observing their
effects on the dynamics of the system.
In summary, the initial version of the new model of signal
transduction in human MEC comprises 240 +biological species
and 1,100 +biochemical interactions. The amount of detailA Dynamical Model of Signal Transduction in hMEC

accomplished by including individual phosphorylation sites,
various localizations, as well as dimers of ErbB receptors, andthe scale in terms of the number of the different pathways includedmakes this model, to our best knowledge, the most comprehensivedynamic model of signal transduction available to date.
2. Model Validation
The model was constructed using only information from the
primary literature about localinteractions. In other words, during
the construction phase of the model there was no attempt todetermine the local interactions based on any other largerphenotypes or phenomena. However, after the model wascompleted, verification of the accuracy of the model involved
testing it for the ability to reproduce complex input-outputphenomena that have been observed in the laboratory. To do this,The Cell Collective’s ‘‘Dynamical Analysis’’ simulation featurewas used [32]. This simulation component allows users to simulatevirtual cells under tens of thousands of cellular conditions, andanalyze and visualize the results in terms of input-output dose-response curves that make it easy to determine whether the virtualcell behaves as expected. The presented hMEC model wasinterrogated to ensure that it is able to reproduce some of theknown global biological phenomena as previously observedexperimentally (Figure 2), including EGF-induced activation of

individual interactions. This graph representation of the model was generated in Gephi (www.gephi.org).

Plants both lose water and take in carbon dioxide through microscopic stomatal pores, each of which is regulated by a
surrounding pair of guard cells. During drought, the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits stomatal opening and
promotes stomatal closure, thereby promoting water conservation. Dozens of cellular components have beenidentified to function in ABA regulation of guard cell volume and thus of stomatal aperture, but a dynamic description
is still not available for this complex process. Here we synthesize experimental results into a consistent guard cell
signal transduction network for ABA-induced stomatal closure, and develop a dynamic model of this process. Ourmodel captures the regulation of more than 40 identified network components, and accords well with previous
experimental results at both the pathway and whole-cell physiological level. By simulating gene disruptions and
pharmacological interventions we find that the network is robust against a significant fraction of possibleperturbations. Our analysis reveals the novel predictions that the disruption of membrane depolarizability, anionefflux, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cytosolic pH increase, the phosphatidic acid pathway, or K
þefflux through
slowly activating Kþchannels at the plasma membrane lead to the strongest reduction in ABA responsiveness. Initial
experimental analysis assessing ABA-induced stomatal closure in the presence of cytosolic pH clamp imposed by theweak acid butyrate is consistent with model prediction. Simulations of stomatal response as derived from our model
provide an efficient tool for the identification of candidate manipulations that have the best chance of conferring
increased drought stress tolerance and for the prioritization of future wet bench analyses. Our method can be readilyapplied to other biological signaling networks to identify key regulatory components in systems where quantitative
information is limited.

Introduction
One central challenge of systems biology is the distillation
of systems level information into applications such as drug
discovery in biomedicine or genetic modiﬁcation of crops. In
terms of applications it is important and practical that weidentify the subset of key components and regulatory
interactions whose perturbation or tuning leads to signiﬁcant
functional changes (e.g., changes in a crop’s ﬁtness underenvironmental stress or changes in the state of malfunction-
ing cells, thereby combating disease). Mathematical modeling
can assist in this process by integrating the behavior ofmultiple components into a comprehensive model that goes
beyond human intuition, and also by addressing questions
that are not yet accessible to experimental analysis.
In recent years, theoretical and computational analysis of
biochemical networks has been successfully applied to well-
deﬁned metabolic pathways, signal transduction, and gene
regulatory networks [1–3]. In parallel, high-throughput
experimental methods have enabled the construction of
genome-scale maps of transcription factor–DNA and pro-
tein–protein interactions [4,5]. The former are quantitative,
dynamic descriptions of experimentally well-studied cellular
pathways with relatively few components, while the latter arestatic maps of potential interactions with no information
about their timing or kinetics. Here we introduce a novelapproach that stands in the middle ground of the above-
mentioned methods by incorporating the synthesis anddynamic modeling of complex cellular networks that contain
diverse, yet only qualitatively known regulatory interactions.
We develop a mathematical model of a highly complex
cellular signaling network and explore the extent to which
the network topology determines the dynamic behavior ofthe system. We choose to examine signal transduction inplant guard cells for two reasons. First, guard cells are centralcomponents in control of plant water balance, and better

understanding of their regulation is important for the goal of
engineering crops with improved drought tolerance. Second,
abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction in guard cells is one of
the best characterized signaling systems in plants: more than
20 components, including signal transduction proteins,
secondary metabolites, and ion channels, have been shown
to participate in ABA-induced stomatal closure. ABA inducesguard cell shrinkage and stomatal closure via two major
secondary messengers, cytosolic Ca
2þ(Ca2þ
c) and cytosolic pH
(pH c). A number of signaling proteins and secondary
messengers have been identiﬁed as regulators of Ca2þinﬂux
from outside the cell or Ca2þrelease from internal stores; the
downstream components responding to Ca2þare certain
vacuolar and plasma membrane Kþpermeable channels, and
anion channels in the plasma membrane [6,7]. Increases in
cytosolic pH promote the opening of anion efﬂux channels
and enhance the opening of voltage-activated outward Kþ
channels in the plasma membrane [8–10]. Stomatal closure iscaused by osmotically driven cell volume changes induced by
both K
þand anion efﬂux through plasma membrane–
localized channels. Despite the wealth of information thathas been collected regarding ABA signal transduction, the
majority of the regulatory relationships are known only
qualitatively and are studied in relative isolation, without
considering their possible feedback or crosstalk with other
pathways. Therefore, in order to synthesize this rich knowl-
edge, one needs to assemble the information on regulatory
mechanisms involved in ABA-induced stomatal closure into a
system-level regulatory network that is consistent with
experimental observations. Clearly, it is difﬁcult to assemblethe network and predict the dynamics of this system from
human intuition alone, and thus theoretical tools are needed.
We synthesize the experimental information available
about the components and processes involved in ABA-induced stomatal closure into a comprehensive network,
and study the topology of paths between signal and response.
To capture the dynamics of information ﬂow in this network
we express synergy between pathways as combinatorial rules
for the regulation of each node, and formulate a dynamic
model of ABA-induced closure. Both in silico and in initial
experimental analysis, we study the resilience of the signaling
network to disruptions. We systematically sample functional
and dynamic perturbations in network components anduncover a rich dynamic repertoire ranging from ABA
hypersensitivity to complete insensitivity. Our model is
validated by its agreement with prior experimental results,
and yields a variety of novel predictions that provide targets
on which further experimental analysis should focus. To our
knowledge, this is one of the most complex biological
networks ever modeled in a dynamical fashion.
Results
Extraction and Organization of Data from the Literature
We focus on ABA induction of stomatal closure, rather
than ABA inhibition of stomatal opening, because these twoprocesses, although related, exhibit distinct mechanisms, and
there is substantially more information on the former process
than on the latter in the literature. Experimental information
about the involvement of a speciﬁc component in ABA-
induced stomatal closure can be partitioned into three
categories. First, biochemical evidence provides informationon enzymatic activity or protein–protein interactions. For
example, the putative G protein–coupled receptor 1 (GCR1)can physically interact with the heterotrimeric G protein a
component 1 (GPA1) as supported by split-ubiquitin and
coimmunoprecipitation experiments [11]. Second, genetic
evidence of differential responses to a stimulus in wild-typeplants versus mutant plants implicates the product of the
mutated gene in the signal transduction process. For
example, the ethyl methanesulfonate–generated ost1mutant
is less sensitive to ABA; thus, one can infer that the OST1protein is a part of the ABA signaling cascade [12]. Third,
pharmacological experiments, in which a chemical is used
either to mimic the elimination of a particular component, orto exogenously provide a certain component, can lead to
similar inferences. For example, a nitric oxide (NO) scavenger
inhibits ABA-induced closure, while a NO donor promotesstomatal closure; thus, NO is a part of the ABA network [13].The last two types of inference do not give direct interactions
but correspond to pathways and pathway regulation. The
existing
theoretical literature on signaling is focused on
networks where the ﬁrst category of information is known,along with the kinetics of each interaction. However, the
availability of such detailed knowledge is very much the
exception rather than the norm in the
experimental
literature. Here we propose a novel method of representing
qualitative and incomplete experimental information and
integrating it into a consistent signal transduction network.
First, we distill experimental conclusions into qualitative
regulatory relationships between cellular components (signal-ing proteins, metabolites, ion channels) and processes. Forexample, the evidence regarding OST1 and NO is summar-
ized as both OST1 and NO promoting ABA-induced stomatal
closure. We distinguish between positive and negativeregulation by using the verbs ‘‘promote ’’and ‘‘inhibit, ’’
represented graphically as ‘‘!’’and ‘‘—j,’’respectively, and
quantify the severity of the effect by the qualiﬁer ‘‘partial. ’’A
partial promoter’s (inhibitor’s) loss has less severe effects thanthe loss of a promoter (inhibitor), most probably due to other
regulatory effects on the target node. Using these relations,
we construct a database that contains more than 140 entriesand is derived from more than 50 literature citations on ABAregulation of stomatal closure (Table S1). A number of entries
in the database correspond to a component-to-component
relationship, such as ‘‘A promotes B, ’’which is mostly
obtained by pharmacological experiments (e.g., applying A
causes B response). However, the majority of the entries
belong to the two categories of indirect inference describedabove, and are of the type ‘‘C promotes the process (A
promotes B). ’’This kind of information can be obtained from
both genetic and pharmacological experiments (e.g., disrupt-
ing C causes less A-induced B response, or applying C and Asimultaneously causes a stronger B response than applying Aonly). There are a few instances of documented independence
of two cellular components, which we identify with the
qualiﬁer ‘‘no relationship. ’’Most of the information is
derived from the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, but data
from other species, mostly Vicia faba, are also included where
comparable information from Arabidopsis thaliana is lacking.
Assembly of the ABA Signal Transduction Network
To synthesize all this information into a consistent
network, we need to determine how the different pathways

suggested by experiments ﬁt together (i.e., we need to ﬁnd the
pathways’ branching and crossing points). We develop a set ofrules compatible with intuitive inference, aiming to deter-
mine the sparsest graph consistent with all experimental
observations. We summarize the most important rules in
Figure 1; in the following we give examples for their
application.
If A!B and C !process (A !B), where A !B is not a
biochemical reaction such as an enzyme catalyzed reaction or
protein–protein/small molecule interaction, we assume that C
is acting on an intermediary node (IN) of the A–B pathway.This IN could be an intermediate protein complex, protein–
small molecule complex, or multiple complexes (see Figure 1,
panel 1). For example, ABA !closure, and NO synthase
(NOS) !process (ABA !closure); therefore, ABA !IN!
closure, NOS !IN. If A !B is a direct process such as a
biochemical reaction or a protein–protein interaction, we
assume that C !process (A !B) corresponds to C !A!B.
A!B and C !process (A !B) can be transformed to A
!C!Bi fA !C is also documented. This means that the
simplest explanation is to identify the putative intermediary
node with C. For example, ABA !NOS, and NOS !process
(ABA !NO) are experimentally veriﬁed and NOS is an
enzyme producing NO, therefore, we infer ABA !NOS !
NO (see Figure 1, panel 2).
A rule similar to rule 1 applies to inhibitory interactions
(denoted by — j); however, in the case of A — jB, and C — j
process (A — jB), the logically correct representation is: A !
IN — jB, C — jIN (see Figure 1, panel 3).
The above rules constitute a heuristic algorithm for ﬁrst
expanding the network wherever the experimental relation-
ships are known to be indirect, and second, minimizing the
uncertainty of the network by ﬁltering synonymous relation-
ships. Mathematically, this algorithm is related to the
problem of ﬁnding the minimum transitive reduction of agraph (i.e., for ﬁnding the sparsest subgraph with the same
reachability relationships as the original) [14]; however, it
differs from previously used algorithms by the fact that the
edges can have one of two signs (activating and inhibitory),
and edges corresponding to direct interactions are main-tained.In the reconstructed network, given in Figure 2, the
network input is ABA and the output is the node ‘‘
Closure. ’’
The small black ﬁlled circles represent putative intermediary
nodes mediating indirect regulatory interactions. The edges(lines) of the network represent interactions and processes
between two components (nodes); an arrowhead at the end of
an edge represents activation, and a short segment at the end
of an edge signiﬁes inhibition. Edges that signify interactions
derived from species other than Arabidopsis are colored light
blue. We indicate two inferred negative feedback loops on
S1P and pH
c(see below) by dashed light blue lines. Nodes
involved in the same metabolic reaction or protein complex
are bordered by a gray box; only those arrows that point into
or out of the box signify information ﬂow (signal trans-duction). Some of the edges on Figure 2 are not explicitly
incorporated in Table S1 because they represent general
biochemical or physical knowledge (e.g., reactions inside gray
boxes or depolarization caused by anion efﬂux).

2þ
cand pH c. Two mechanisms of Ca2þ
c
increase have been identiﬁed: Ca2þinﬂux from outside the
cell and Ca2þrelease from internal stores. Ca2þcan be
released from stores by InsP3 [15] and InsP6 [16], both of
which are synthesized in response to ABA, or by cADPR and
cGMP [17], whose upstream signaling molecule, NO [13,18], is
indirectly activated by ABA. Opening of channels mediatingCa
2þinﬂux is mainly stimulated by reactive oxygen species
(ROS) [19], and we reconstruct two ABA-ROS pathways
involving OST1 [12] and GPA1 (L. Perfus-Barbeoch and S. M.
Assmann, unpublished data), respectively. Based on current
experimental evidence these two pathways are distinct, butnot independent. The downstream components responding
to Ca
2þare certain vacuolar and plasma membrane Kþ
permeable channels, and anion channels in the plasma
membrane [6,7]. The mechanism of pH control by ABA is
less clear, but it is known that pH cincreases shortly after ABA
treatment [20,21]. Increases in pH clevels promote the
opening of anion efﬂux channels and enhance the openingof voltage-activated outward K
þchannels in the plasma
membrane [8–10]. Stomatal closure is caused by osmotically
driven cell volume changes induced by Kþand anion efﬂux
through plasma membrane-localized channels, and there is a
complex interregulation between ion ﬂux and membranedepolarization.
In addition to the secondary-messenger–induced pathways,
there are two less-well-studied ABA signaling pathways
involving the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and
the organic anion malate. ABA inactivates the small GTPase
protein RAC1, which in turn blocks actin cytoskeleton
disruption [22], contribut ing to an ABA-induced actin
cytoskeleton reorganization process that is potentially Ca
2þ
c
dependent [23]. In our model system, Arabidopsis, ABA
regulation of malate levels has not been described. However,
inV. faba it has been shown that ABA inhibits PEP carboxylase
and malate synthesis [24], and that ABA induces malatebreakdown [25]. In some conditions sucrose is an osmoticum
that contributes to guard cell turgor [26,27] but no
mechanisms of ABA regulation of sucrose levels have been
described.

ABI1, abi1-1R, is hypersensitive to ABA [28,29]. ABI1 is
negatively regulated by phosphatidic acid (PA) and ROS, andpH
ccan activate ABI1 [30–32]. ABI1 negatively regulates
RAC1 [22]. We hypothesize that ABI1 negatively regulates the
NADPH oxidase (Atrboh) because ABI1 negatively regulatesROS production and Atrboh has been shown to be thedominant producer of ROS in guard cells [33]. We alsoassume that ABI1 inhibits anion efﬂux at the plasmamembrane, because the dominant abi1–1 mutant is known
to affect the ABA response of anion channels [34] andbecause anion channels are documented key regulators of
ABA-induced stomatal closure [35]. Components functioning
downstream from ABI2 and its role in guard cell signaling arenot well established, so ABI2 is not included. The newlyisolated PP2C recessive mutants, AtP2C-HA [36] and AtPP2CA
[37], exhibit minor ABA hypersensitivity. However, theirFigure 2. Current Knowledge of Guard Cell ABA Signaling

Model of Guard Cell ABA Signaling
downstream targets remain elusive; thus, we incorporate
them as a general inhibitor of closure denoted AtPP2C.
Mutation of the gene encoding the mRNA cap-binding
protein, ABH1, results in hypersensitivity of ABA-inducedCa
2þ
celevation/oscillation and of anion efﬂux in plants grown
under some environmental conditions [38,39]. We assume an
inhibitory effect of ABH1 on Ca2þinﬂux across the plasma
membrane (CaIM), which can explain both of these effectsdue to the Ca
2þregulation of anion efﬂux. Since the abh1
mutation affects transcript levels of some genes involved in
ABA response, this mutation may also affect ABA sensitivityby altering gene expression rather than by regulation of therapid signaling events on which our network focuses.
Mutations in the gene encoding the farnesyl transferase
ERA1 or the gene encoding GCR1 also lead to hypersensitiveABA-induced closure; ERA1 has been shown to negativelyregulate CaIM and anion efﬂux [40,41], whereas GCR1 has
been shown to be interact with GPA1 [11]. We assume that
ERA1 negatively regulates CaIM and GCR1 negativelyregulates GPA1.
Another assumption in the network is that the protein
phosphatase RCN1/PP2A regulates nitrate reductase (NIA12)activity as observed in spinach leaf tissue; this is expected to
be a well-conserved mechanism due to the high sequence
conservation of NIA-PP2A regulatory domains [42]. Figure 2contains two putative autoregulatory negative feedback loops
acting on S1P and pH
c, respectively. The existence of
feedback regulation can be inferred from the publishedtimecourse measurements of S1P [43] and pH
c[21]—both

decrease—but the mediators are currently unknown. The
assembled network is consistent with our biological knowl-edge with minimal additional assumptions, and it will serve asthe starting point for the graph analysis and dynamic
modeling described in the following sections.
Modeling ABA Signal Transduction
Signaling networks can be represented as directed graphs
where the orientation of the edges reﬂects the direction ofinformation propagation (signal transduction). In a signal
transduction network there exists a clear starting point, the
node representing the signal (here, ABA), and one can followthe paths (successions of edges) from that starting point tothe node(s) representing the output(s) of the network (here,
stomatal closure). The signal–output paths correspond to the
propagation of reactions in chemical space, and can bethought of as pseudodynamics [44]. When only static
information is available, pseudodynamics takes into account
the graph theoretical properties of the signal transductionnetwork. For example, one can measure the number of nodesor distinct network motifs that appear one, two, ...n edges
away from the signal node. Such motifs reﬂect different
cellular signaling processing capabilities and provide impor-tant insights into the biological processes under investigation.Graph theoretical measures can also provide information
about the importance (centrality) of signal mediators [45] and
can predict the changes in path structure when nodes oredges in the network are disrupted. These disruptions,explored experimentally by ge netic mutations, voltage-
clamping, or pharmacological interventions, can be modeled
in silico by removing the perturbed node and all its edgesfrom the graph [46]. The absence of nodes and edges willdisrupt the paths in the network, causing a possible increase
in the length of the shortest path between signal (ABA) and
output (closure), suggesting decreased ABA sensitivity, or in
severe cases the loss of all paths connecting input and output(i.e., ABA insensitivity).
We ﬁnd that there are several partially or completely
independent (nonoverlapping) paths between ABA and
closure. The path of pH-induced anion efﬂux is independent
of the paths involving changes in Ca
2þ
c. Based on the current
knowledge incorporated in Figure 2, the path mediated by
malate breakdown is independent of both Ca2þand pH
signaling. This result could change if evidence of a suggested
link between pH and malate regulation [47] is found; note
that regulation of malate synthesis in guard cells appears to
have cell-speciﬁc aspects [48]. Increase in Ca2þ
ccan be
induced by several independent paths involving ROS, NO,or InsP6. Thanks to the existence of numerous redundant
signal (ABA)–output (closure) paths, a complete disconnec-
tion of signal from output (loss of all the paths) is possible
only if four nodes, corresponding to actin reorganization,
pH
cincrease, malate breakdown, and membrane depolariza-
tion, are simultaneously disrupted. This indicates a remark-
able topological resilience, and suggests that functionally
redundant mechanisms can compensate for single gene
disruptions and can maintain at least partial ABA sensitivity.
However, path analysis alone cannot capture bidirectional
signal propagation and synergy (cooperativity) in living
biological systems. For example, two nonoverlapping pathsthat reach the node closure could be functionally synergistic.
Using only path analysis, disruption of either path would not
be predicted to lead to a disconnection of the signal (ABA)
from the output (closure), but due to the synergy between the
two paths, the closure response may be strongly impaired ifeither of the two paths is disrupted experimentally. Because
of such limitations of path analysis, we turn from path
analysis to a dynamic description.
Dynamic models have as input information (1) the
interactions and regulatory relationships between compo-
nents (i.e., the interaction network); (2) how the strength of
the interactions depends on the state of the interactingcomponents (i.e., the transfer functions); and (3) the initial
state of each component in the system. Given these, the
model will output the time evolution of the state of the
system (e.g., the system’s response to the presence or absence
of a given signal). Given the incomplete characterization ofthe processes involved in ABA-induced stomatal closure (as is
typical of the current state of knowledge of cell signaling
cascades), we employ a qualitative modeling approach. We
assume that the state of the network nodes can have two
qualitative values: 0 (inactive/off) and 1 (active/on) [49]. These
values can also describe two conformational states of a
protein, such as closed and open states of an ion channel, orbasal and high activity for enzymes. This assumption is
necessary due to the absence of quantitative concentration or
activity information for the vast majority of the network
components. It is additionally justiﬁed by the fact that in the
case of combinatorial regulation or cooperative binding, theinput–output relationships are sigmoidal and thus can be
distilled into two discrete output states [50].
Since ‘‘stomatal closure ’’does not usually entail the
complete closure of the stomatal pore but rather a clear
decrease in the stomatal aperture, and since there is a

signiﬁcant variability in the response of individual stomata,
the threshold separating the off (0) and on (1) state of the
node ‘‘Closure ’’needs to invoke a population level descrip-
tion. We measured the stomatal aperture size distribution in
the absence of ABA or after treatment with 50 lM ABA (see
Materials and Methods). Our ﬁrst observation was the
population-level heterogeneity of stomatal apertures even
in their resting condition (Figure 3A), a fact that may not be
widely appreciated when more standard presentations, such
as mean 6standard error, are used (see Figure 3B). The
stomatal aperture distribution shifts towards smaller aper-
tures after ABA treatment, and also broadens considerably.
The latter result is inconsistent with the assumption of each
stomate changing its aperture according to a common
function that decreases with increasing ABA concentration,
and suggests considerable cell-to-cell variation in the degree
of response to ABA. Moreover, although there is a clear
difference between the most probable ‘‘open ’’(0 ABA) and
‘‘closed ’’(þABA) aperture sizes, there also exists an overlap
b e t w e e nt h ea p e r t u r es i z ed i s t r i b u t i o no f ‘‘open ’’and
‘‘closed ’’stomata. This result indicates the possibility of
differential and cell-autonomous stomatal responses to ABA.
In the absence of 6ABA measurements on the same stomate,
we deﬁne the threshold of closure as a statistically signiﬁcantshift of the stomatal aperture distribution towards smaller
apertures in response to ABA signal transduction.
In our model the dynamics of state changes are governed
by logical (Boolean) rules giving the state transition of each
node given the state of its regulators (upstream nodes). We
determine the Boolean transfer function for each node based
on experimental evidence. The state of a node regulated by a
single upstream component will follow the state of its
regulator with a delay. If two or more pathways canindependently lead to a node’s activation, we combine them
with a logical ‘‘or’’function. If two pathways cannot work
independently, we model their synergy as a logical ‘‘and ’’
function. For nodes regulated by inhibitors we assume that
the necessary condition of their activation (state 1) is that theinhibitor is inactive (state 0). As all putative intermediary
nodes of Figure 2 are regulated by a single activator, and
regulate a single downstream component, they only affect thetime delays between known nodes; for this reason we do notexplicitly incorporate intermediary nodes as components of
the dynamic model. Table 1 lists the regulatory rules of
known nodes of Figure 2; we give a detailed justiﬁcation ofeach rule in Text S1.
Frequently in Boolean models time is quantized into
regular intervals (timesteps), assuming that the duration ofall activation and decay processes is comparable [51]. For
generality we do not make this assumption, and in the
absence of timing or duration information we follow anasynchronous method that allows for signiﬁcant stochasticity
in process durations [52,53]. Choosing as a timestep the
longest duration required for a node to respond to a changein the state of its regulator(s) (also called a round of update, aseach component’s state will be updated during this time
interval), the Boolean updating rules of an asynchronous
algorithm can be written as:

Model of Guard Cell ABA Signaling
The relative timing of each process is chosen randomly and
is changed after each update round such that we are sampling
equally among all possibilities (see Materials and Methods).
This approach reﬂects the lack of experimental data on
relative reaction speeds. The internal states of signaling
proteins and the concentrations of small molecules are not
explicitly known for each stomate, and components such as
Ca2þ
cand cell membrane potential show various states even
in a homogenous experimental setup [54,55]. Accordingly, we
sample a large number (10,000) of randomly selected initial
states for the nodes other than ABA and closure (closure is
initially set to 0), and let the system evolve either with ABA
always on (1) or ABA always off (0). We quantify the
probability of closure (equivalent to the percentage of closed
stomata in the population) by the formula
Pðclosure Þt¼XN

As shown in Figure 5, in eight steps, the system shows
complete closure in response to ABA. In contrast, withoutABA, although some initial states lead to closure at thebeginning, within six steps the probability of closureapproaches 0. Initial theoretical analysis of the attractors(stable behaviors) of this nonlinear dynamic system conﬁrms
that when given a constant ABA ¼1 input, the majority of
nodes will approach a steady state value within three to eightsteps. This steady-state value does not depend on the initialconditions. For example, OST1, PLC, and InsPK stabilize inthe on state, and PEPC settles into the off state within the ﬁrsttimestep when ABA is consistently on. The exception is a setof 12 nodes, including Ca

Figure 4. Schematic Illustration of Our Modeling Methodology and of the Probability of Closure
In this four-node network example, node A is the input (as ABA is the input of the ABA signal transduction network), and node D is the output
(corresponding to the node ‘‘Closure ’’in the ABA signal transduction network). The nodes’ states are indicated by the shading of their symbols: open
symbols represent the off (0) state and filled symbols signify the on (1) state. To indicate the connection between this example and ABA-inducedclosure, we associate D ¼off (0) with a picture of an open stomate, and D ¼on (1) with a picture of a closed stomate. The Boolean transfer functions of
this network are A* ¼1, B*¼A, C* ¼A, D* ¼B and C (i.e., node A is on commencing immediately after the initial condition, the next states of nodes B
and C are determined by A, and D is on only when both B and C are on).
(A) The first column represents the networks’ initial states; the input and output are not on, but some of the components in the network are randomly
activated (e.g., middle row, node B). The input node A turns on right after initialization, signifying the initiation of the ABA signal. The next threecolumns in (A) represent the network’s intermediary states during a sequential update of the nodes B, C, and D, where the updated node is given as a
gray label above the gray arrow corresponding to the state transition. This sequence of three transitions represents a round of updates from timestep 1
(second column) to timestep 2 (last column). Out of a total of 2
233!¼24 possible different normal responses, two sketches of normal responses are
shown in the top two rows. The bottom row illustrates a case in which one node (shown as a square) is disrupted (knocked out) and cannot be
regulated or regulate downstream nodes (indicated as dashed edges).
(B) The probability of closure indicates the fraction of simulations where the output D ¼1 is reached in each timestep; thus, in this illustration the
probability of closure for the normal response (circles) increases from 0% at time step 1 to 100% at timestep 2. The knockout mutant’s probability of
closure (squares) is 0% at both time steps.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040312.g004

efﬂux mechanisms driving stomatal closure (see last entry of
Table 1), and the stabilization of the other regulators of the
node ‘‘Closure, ’’a closed steady state (Closure ¼1) is attained
within eight steps for any initial condition. The details of this
analysis will be published elsewhere.
Identification of Essential Components
After testing the wild-type (intact) system, we investigate
whether the disruption (loss) of a component changes thesystem’s response to ABA. We systematically perturb the
system by setting the state of a node to 0 (off state), and
holding it at 0 for the duration of the simulation. Thisperturbation mimics the effect of a knockout mutation for agene or pharmaceutical inhibition of secondary messenger
production or of kinase or phosphatase activity. We
characterize the effect of the node disruption by calculatingthe percentage (probability) of closure response to a constantABA signal at each time step and comparing it with the
percentage of closure in the wild-type system.
The perturbed system’s responses can be classiﬁed into ﬁve
categories with respect to the system’s steady state and the
time it takes to reach the steady state. We designate responsesidentical or very close to the wild-type response as havingnormal sensitivity; in these cases the probability of closure
reaches 100% within eight timesteps. Disruptions that cause
the percentage of closed stomata to decrease to zero after theﬁrst few steps are denoted as conferring ABA insensitivity (in
accord with experimental nomenclature). We observe re-
sponses where the probability of closure (the percentage ofstomata closed at any given timestep) settles at a nonzerovalue that is less than 100%; we classify these responses as
having reduced sensitivity. Finally, in two classes of behavior
the probability of closure ultimately reaches 100%, but with adifferent timing than the normal response. We refer to aresponse with ABA-induced closure that is slower than wild-
type as hyposensitivity, while hypersensitivity corresponds to
ABA-induced closure that is faster than wild-type. Therefore,the perturbed system’s responses can be classiﬁed into ﬁvecategories in the order of decreasing sensitivity defect:
insensitivity to ABA, reduced sensitivity, hyposensitivity,
normal sensitivity, and hypersensitivity.
We ﬁnd that 25 single node disruptions (65%; compare
with Table 2) do not lead to qualitative effects: 100% of thepopulation responds to ABA with timecourses very close to
the wild-type response. In contrast, the loss of membrane
depolarizability, the disruption of anion efﬂux, and the loss ofactin cytoskeleton reorganization present clear vulnerabil-ities: irrespective of initial conditions or of relative timing, all
simulated stomata become insensitive to ABA (Figure 5A).
Indeed, membrane depolarization is a necessary condition ofK
þefﬂux, which is a necessary condition of closure, as is actin
cytoskeleton reorganization and anion efﬂux. The individual
disruption of seven other components—PLD, PA, SphK, S1P,
GPA1, Kþefﬂux through slowly activating Kþchannels at the
plasma membrane (KOUT), and pH cincrease —reduces ABA
sensitivity, as the percentage of closed stomata in the
population decreases to 20%—80% (see Figure 5B). At least
ﬁve components (S1P, SphK, PLD, PA, pH c) of these 7
predicted components have been shown to impair ABA-

Model of Guard Cell ABA Signaling
induced closure when clamped or mutated experimentally
[8,31,43,58]. For these disruptions, both theoretical analysisand numerical results indicate that all simulated stomataconverge to limit cycles (oscillations) driven by the Ca
2þ
c
oscillations, yet the ratio of open and closed stomata in the
population is the same at any timepoint, leading to a constantprobability of closure. (The alternative possibility, of a subsetof stomata being stably closed and another subset stably open,was not observed for any disruption.)For all other single-node disruptions the probability of
closure ultimately reaches 100% (i.e., all simulated stomata
reach the closed steady state); however, the rate of con-
vergence diverges from the rate of the wild-type response (see
Figure 5C). Disruption of Ca
2þ
cincrease or of the production
of ROS leads to ABA hyposensitivity (slower than wild-typeresponse). In contrast, the disruption of ABI1 or of the Ca
2þ
ATPase(s) leads to ABA hypersensitivity (faster than wild
type-response) (Figure 5C). The hyposensitive and hyper-sensitive responses are statistically distinguishable ( p,0.05
for all intermediary time steps [i.e., for 0 ,t,8]) from the
normal responses. Our model predicts that perturbation ofOST1 leads to a slower than normal response that is
nevertheless not slow enough to be classiﬁed as hyposensitive.
Indeed, ost1mutants are still responsive to ABA even though
not as strongly as wild-type plants [12].
After analyzing all single knockout simulations, we turned
to analysis of double and triple knockout simulations. First, toeffectively distinguish between normal, hypo- and hyper-
sensitive responses (all of which achieve 100% probability of
closure, but at different rates), we calculated the cumulative
percentage of closure (CPC) by adding the probability of
closure over 12 steps; the smaller the CPC value, the moreslowly the probability of closure reaches 100%, and vice
versa. Plotting the histogram of CPC values reveals a clear
separation into three distinct groups of response in the caseof single disruptions (Figure 6A). In contrast, the cumulative
effects of multiple perturb ations lead to a continuous
distribution of sensitivities in a broad range around thenormal (Figure 6B and 6C). We use the single perturbation
results to identify three classes of response that achieve 100%
closure, but at varying rates. We deﬁne two CPC thresholds:the midpoint between the most hyposensitive single mutant
and normal response, CPC
hypo¼10.35; and the midpoint
between the normal and least hypersensitive single mutantresponse, CPC
hyper ¼10.7. Disruptions with cumulative
closure probability ,CPC hypoare classiﬁed as hyposensitive,
disruptions with cumulative closure probability .CPC hyper
are hypersensitive; and values between the two thresholds are
classiﬁed as normal responses. This hypo/hypersensitive
classiﬁcation does not affect the determination of insensitive
or reduced sensitivity responses, which are identiﬁed by
observing a null or less than 100% probability of closure.
For double (triple) knockout simulations, some combina-
tions of perturbations exhibit sensitivities that are independ-
ent of the sensitivity of each of their components’perturbation. Normal ABA-induced stomatal closure isTable 2. Single to Triple Node Disruptions in the Dynamic Model

In all the perturbations, there are five groups of responses. Normal sensitivity refers to a response close to the wild-type response (shown as black t riangles and dashed line in Figure 5).
Insensitivity means that the probability of closure is zero after the first three steps (see Figure 5A). Reduced sensitivity means that the probabili ty of closure is less than 100% (see dashed
symbols in Figure 5B). Hyposensitivity corresponds to ABA-induced closure that is slower than wild-type (black diamonds in Figure 5C). Hypersensit ivity corresponds to ABA-induced
closure that is faster than wild-type (black squares in Figure 5C).

preserved in 38% (23%) of combinations (see Table 2). In
contrast, ABA signaling is completely blocked in 16% (25%)of disruptions. In addition to perturbations involving thethree previously found insensitivity-causing single knockouts(loss of membrane depolarizability, the disruption of anionefﬂux, and the loss of actin cytoskeleton reorganization), alarge number of novel combinations are found. Interestingly,perturbations of Ca
2þ
cor Ca2þrelease from stores, when
combined with disruptions in PLD, PA, GPA1, or pH c, lead to
insensitivity (see Figure 7 and Discussion). ABA-induced
closure is reduced (but not lost entirely) in 27% (31%) of thecases. Hyposensitive responses are found for 12% (13%) ofdouble (triple) perturbations. All of the double perturbationsin this category involve a knockout mutation of Ca
2þ
c,
Atrboh, or ROS. The triple perturbations involve a knockoutmutation of Ca
2þ
c, Atrboh, or ROS, plus two other perturba-
tions, or combinations of three disruptions that alone are notpredicted to cause quantiﬁable effects (e.g., guanyl cyclase,Ca
2þrelease from internal stores [CIS], and CaIM; see Figure
7). Around 6% (7%) of double (triple) perturbations, allincluding a knockout mutation of ABI1 or Ca
2þATPase, lead
to a hypersensitive response. In summary, accumulatingperturbations cause a dramatic decrease in the percentageof normal response; the majority of triple knockouts areeither insensitive or have reduced sensitivity. The fraction ofhyposensitive and hypersensitive knockouts increases onlymoderately.Experimental Assessment of Model Predictions
As a ﬁrst step toward experimental assessment of the
model’s predictions, we used a weak acid, Na-butyrate, to
clamp cytosolic pH, and then we treated the stomata with 50
lM ABA and observed the stomatal aperture responses. As
shown in Figure 8A, the stomatal aperture distributions
without butyrate treatments shift towards smaller apertures
after ABA treatment, forming a distribution that overlapswith, but is clearly distinguishable from, the 0 ABA
distribution. However, when increasing concentrations of
butyrate are added in the solution, the ‘‘open ’’(0 ABA) and
‘‘closed ’’(þABA) distributions become increasingly over-
lapping (Figure 8B–8D). At the highest butyrate concentra-
tion (5 mM; Figure 8D), the 0 ABA and þABA populations of
stomatal apertures are statistically identical (the null hypoth-
esis that the two distributions are the same cannot be

rejected; two-tailed ttest, p.0.05). These results qualitatively
support our prediction of the importance of pH csignaling.
For a more quantitative comparison with the theoretically
predicted probability of closure corresponding to pH
clamping, one can deﬁne a threshold C between open and
closed stomatal states, such that stomata with apertures largerthan C can be classiﬁed as open and stomata with lower
apertures can be classiﬁed as closed. We identify the thresh-
old value C ¼4.3lm by simultaneously minimizing the
fraction of stomata classiﬁ ed as closed in the control
condition and maximizing this fraction in the ABA treated
condition. Using this threshold we ﬁnd that the fraction of
closed stomata in the 50 lM ABA þ5 mM Na-butyrate
population is 26%, in agreement with the theoretically
predicted probability of closure (Figure 5B).
In plant systems, cytosolic pH changes in response to
multiple hormones such as ABA [20,59], jasmonates [21],
auxin [59], etc. The downstream effectors of pH changes
include ion channels [8], protein kinases [60], and protein
phosphatases [30]. Previous experiments with guard cells have
demonstrated the efﬁcacy of butyrate in imposing a cytosolic
pH clamp [8,21]. While these prior experiments focused on a
single concentration of butyrate, here we used ﬁve different
concentrations (three shown), with 120 stomata sampled for
each treatment. As seen in Figure 8, we were able to monitorthe effect of butyrate in the þABA treatment in both
increasing the mean aperture size and reducing the spread
of the aperture sizes. There is a clear indication of saturation
between the two highest butyrate concentrations. While
detailed measurements of cytosolic pH constitute a full
separate study beyond the scope of the present article, the
results of Figure 8 support the suggestion from our model
that pH
cshould receive increased attention by experimen-
talists as a focal point for transduction of the ABA signal.
Discussion
Network Synthesis and Path Analysis
Logical organization of large-scale data sets is an important
challenge in systems biology; our model provides such
organization for one guard cell signaling system. As summar-
ized in Table S1, we have organized and formalized the large
amount of information that has been gathered on ABA
induction of stomatal closure from individual experiments.
This information has been used to reconstruct the ABA
signaling network (Figure 2). Figure 2 uses different types ofedges (lines) to depict activation and inhibition, and also uses
different edge colors to indicate whether the information was
derived from our model species, Arabidopsis, or from another
plant species. Different types of nodes (metabolic enzymes,
signaling proteins, transporters, and small molecules) are also
color coded. An advantage of our method of network
construction over other methods such as those used in
Science’s Signal Transducti on Knowledge Environment
(STKE) connection maps [61] is the inclusion of intermediate
nodes when direct physical interactions between two compo-
nents have not been demonstrated.
As is evident from Figure 2, network synthesis organizes
complex information sets in a form such that the collective
components and their relationships are readily accessible.
From such analysis, new relationships are implied and new
predictions can be made that would be difﬁcult to derivefrom less formal analysis. For example, building the network
allows one to ‘‘see ’’inferred edges that are not evident from
the disparate literature reports. One example is the pathfrom S1P to ABI1 through PLD. Separate literature reports
indicate that PLD anull mutants show increased transpira-
tion, that PLD a1 physically interacts with GPA1, that S1P
promotion of stomatal closure is reduced in gpa1 mutants,
that PLD catalyses the production of PA, and that recessive
abi1 mutants are hypersensitive to ABA. Network inference
allows one to represent all this information as the S1P !
GPA1 !PLD !PA— jABI1— jclosure path, and make the
prediction that ABA inhibition of ABI1 phosphatase activity
will be impaired in sphingosine kinase mutants unable toproduce S1P.
Another prediction that can be derived from our network
analysis is a remarkable redundancy of ABA signaling, asthere are eight paths that emanate from ABA in Figure 2 and,
based on current knowledge (though see below) these paths
are initially independent. The prediction of redundancy isconsistent with previous, less formal analyses [62]. Theintegrated guard cell signal transduction network (which
includes the ABA signal transduction network) has been
proposed as an example of a robust scale-free network [62].To classify a network as scale-free, one needs to determine
the degree (the number of edges, representing interactions/
regulatory relationships) of each node, and to calculate thedistribution of node degrees (denoted degree distribution)[45,46]. Scale-free networks, characterized by a degree
distribution described by a power law, retain their connec-
tivity in the face of random node disruptions, but break downwhen the highest-degree nodes (the so-called hubs) are lost[46]. While the guard cell network may ultimately prove to be
scale-free, the network is not sufﬁciently large at present to
verify the existence of a power-law degree distribution; thus,the analogy with scale-free networks cannot be rigorouslysatisﬁed.
Dynamic Modeling
Our model differs from previous models employed in the
life sciences in the following fundamental aspects. First, wehave reconstructed the signaling network from inferredindirect relationships and pathways as opposed to direct
interactions; in graph theoretical terminology, we found the
minimal network consistent with a set of reachabilityrelationships. This network predicts the existence of numer-
ous additional signal mediators (intermediary nodes), all of
which could be targets of regulation. Second, the networkobtained is signiﬁcantly more complex than those usuallymodeled in a dynamic fashion. We bridge the incompleteness
of regulatory knowledge and the absence of quantitative
dose-response relationships for the vast majority of theinteractions in the network by employing qualitative andstochastic dynamic modeling previously applied only in the
context of gene regulatory networks [53].
Mathematical models of stomatal behavior in response to
environmental change have been studied for decades [63,64].
However, no mathematical model has been formulated thatintegrates the multitude of recent experimental ﬁndingsconcerning the molecular signaling network of guard cells.
Boolean modeling has been used to describe aspects of plant
development such as speciﬁcation of ﬂoral organs [65], andthere are a handful of reports describing Boolean models of

Model of Guard Cell ABA Signaling
light and pathogen-, and light by carbon-regulated gene
expression [66–68]. Use of a qualitative modeling framework
for signaling networks is justiﬁed by the observation that
signaling networks maintain their function even when facedwith ﬂuctuations in components and reaction rates [69]. Our
model uses experimental evidence concerning the effects of
gene knockouts and pharmacological interventions for
inferring the downstream targets of the corresponding gene
products and the sign of the regulatory effect on thesetargets. However, use of this information does not guarantee
that the dynamic model will reproduce the dynamic outcome
of the knockout or intervention. Indeed, all model ingre-
dients (node states, transfer functions) refer to the node
(component) level, and there is no explicit control overpathway-level effects. Moreover, the combinatorial transfer
functions we employed are, to varying extents, conjectures,
informed by the best available experimental information (see
Text S1). Finally, in the absence of detailed knowledge of the
timing of each process and of the baseline (resting) activity of
each component, we deliberately sample timescales and
initial conditions randomly. Thus, an agreement betweenexperimental and theoretical results of node disruptions is
not inherent, and would provide a validation of the model.
The accuracy of our model is indeed supported by its
congruency with experimental observation at multiple levels.
At the pathway level, our model captures, for example, the
inhibition of ABA-induced ROS production in both ost1
mutants and atrboh mutants [12,19,21] and the block of ABA-
induced stomatal closure in a dominant-positive atRAC1
mutant [22]. In our model, as in experiments, ABA-induced
NO production is abolished in either nossingle or nia12
double mutants [13,18]. Moreover, the model reproduces the
outcome that ABA can induce cytosolic K
þdecrease by Kþ
efﬂux through the alternative potassium channel KAP, even
when ABA-induced NO production leads to the inhibition of
the outwardly-rectifying (KOUT) channel [70]. At the level of
whole stomatal physiology, our model captures the ﬁndings
that anion efﬂux [35,71] and actin cytoskeleton reorganiza-
tion [22] are essential to ABA-induced stomatal closure. The
importance of other components such as PA, PLD, S1P,GPA1, KOUT, pH
cin stomatal closure control
[8,20,31,43,58,72], and the ABA hypersensitivity conferred
by elimination of signaling through ABI1 [28,29], are also
reproduced. Our model is also consistent with the observa-
tion that transgenic plants with low PLC expression stilldisplay ABA sensitivity [73].
The fact that our model accords well with experimental
results suggests that the inferences and assumptions made are
correct overall, and enables us to use the model to make
predictions about situations that have yet to be put to
experimental test. For example, the model predicts that
disruption of all Ca
2þATPases will cause increased ABA
sensitivity, a phenomenon difﬁcult to address experimentally
due to the large family of calcium ATPases expressed in
Arabidopsis guard cells (unpublished data). Most of the
multiple perturbation results presented in Figure 5 and
Table 2 also represent predictions, as very few of them havebeen tested experimentally. Results from our model can now
be used by experimentalists to prioritize which of the
multitude of possible double and triple knockout combina-
tions should be studied ﬁrst in wet bench experiments.
Most importantly, our model makes novel predictionsconcerning the relative importance of certain regulatory
elements. We predict three essential components whoseelimination completely blocks ABA-induced stomatal closure:membrane depolarization, anion efﬂux, and actin cytoskele-ton reorganization. Seven components are predicted todramatically affect the extent and stability of ABA-inducedstomatal closure: pH
ccontrol, PLD, PA, SphK, S1P, G protein
signaling (GPA1), and Kþefﬂux. Five additional components,
namely increase of cytosolic Ca2þ, Atrboh, ROS, the Ca2þ
ATPase(s), and ABI1, are predicted to affect the speed of
ABA-induced stomatal closure. Note that a change instomatal response rate may have signiﬁcant repercussions,as some stimuli to which guard cells respond ﬂuctuate on theorder of seconds [74,75]. Thus our model predicts twoqualitatively different realizations of a partial response toABA: ﬂuctuations in individual responses (leading to areduced steady-state sensitivity at the population level), anddelayed response. These predictions provide targets on whichfurther experimental analysis should focus.
Six of the 13 key positive regulators, namely increase of
cytosolic Ca
2þ, depolarization, elevation of pH c, ROS, anion
efﬂux, and Kþefﬂux through outwardly rectifying Kþ
channels, can be considered as network hubs [45], as theyare in the set of ten highest degree (most interactive) nodes.Other nodes whose disruption leads to reduced ABAsensitivity, namely SphK, S1P, GPA1, PLD, and PA, are part
of the ABA !PA path. While they are not highly connected
themselves, their disruption leads to upregulation of theinhibitor ABI1, thus decreasing the efﬁciency of ABA-induced stomatal closure. Similarly, the node representingactin reorganization has a low degree. Thus the intuitiveprediction, suggested by studies in yeast gene knockouts[76,77], that there would be a consistent positive correlationbetween a node’s degree and its dynamic importance, is notsupported here, providing another example of how dynamicmodeling can reveal insights difﬁcult to achieve by less formalmethods. This lack of correlation has also been found in thecontext of other complex networks [78].
Comparing Figure 3 and Figure 6C, one can notice a
similar heterogeneity in the measured stomatal aperture sizedistributions and the theoretical distribution of the cumu-lative probability of closure in the case of multiple nodedisruptions. While apparently unconnected, there is a link
between the two types of heterogeneity. Due to stochastic
effects on gene and protein expression, it is possible that in areal environment not all components of the ABA signaltransduction network are fully functional. Therefore, evengenetically identical populations of guard cells may beheterogeneous at the regulatory and functional level, andmay respond to ABA in slightly different ways. In this case,the heterogeneity in double and triple disruption simulationsprovides an explanation for the observed heterogeneity inthe experimentally normal response: the latter is actually amixture of responses from genetically highly similar butfunctionally nonidentical guard cells.

enon of oscillations in cytosolic Ca2þconcentration, which
has been frequently observed in experimental studies
[56,81,82]. In experiments where Ca2þ
cis manipulated,
imposed Ca2þ
coscillations with a long periodicity (e.g., 10
min of Ca2þelevation with a periodicity of once every 20 min)
are effective in triggering and maintaining stomatal closure,
yet at 10 min (i.e., after just one Ca2þ
ctransient elevation and
thus before the periodicity of the Ca2þchange can be
‘‘known ’’by the cell), signiﬁcant stomatal closure has already
occurred [56]. This result suggests that the Ca2þ
coscillation
signature may be more important for the maintenance of
closure than for the induction of closure [56,81], and that the
induction of closure might only be dependent on the ﬁrst,
transient Ca2þ
celevation.
According to our model, if Ca2þ
celevation occurs, then
stomatal closure is triggered (consistent with numerousexperimental studies), but Ca
2þ
celevation is not required
for ABA-induced stomatal closure. Re-evaluation of the
experimental studies on ABA and Ca2þ
creveals support for
this prediction. First, although Ca2þelevation certainly can be
observed in guard cell responses to ABA, numerous exper-imental results also show that Ca
2þ
celevation is only observed
in a fraction of the guard cells assayed [9,83]. Furthermore,
absence of Ca2þ
celevation in response to ABA does not
prevent the occurrence of downstream events such as ion
channel regulation [84,85] and stomatal closure [86,87], a
phenomenon also predicted by our in silico analysis. Second,
it has been observed that some guard cells exhibit sponta-neous oscillations in Ca
2þ
c, and in such cells, ABA application
actually suppresses further Ca2þ
celevation [88]; thus, ABA
and Ca2þ
celevation are clearly decoupled.
Our model does predict that disruption of Ca2þsignaling
leads to ABA hyposensitivity, or a slower than normalresponse to ABA. In the real-world environment, even a
slight delay or change in responsiveness may have signiﬁcant
repercussions, as some stimuli to which guard cells respond
ﬂuctuate on the order of seconds; and stomatal responses can
have comparable rapidity [74,75]. Moreover, our model
predicts that Ca
2þ
celevation (although not necessarily
oscillation) becomes required for engendering stomatalclosure when pH
cchanges, Kþefﬂux or the S1P–PA pathway
are perturbed (see Figure 7). Thus, Ca2þ
cmodulation confers
an essential redundancy to the network. Support for such a
redundant role can be found in a study by Webb et al. [89]
where Ca2þconcentration was reduced below normal resting
levels by intracellular application of BAPTA (such reduction
in baseline Ca2þ
clevels has been shown to reduce ABA
activation of anion channels [85]) and the epidermal tissue
was perfused with CO 2-free air, a treatment that has been
shown to inhibit outwardly rectifying Kþchannels and slow
anion efﬂux channels [90]. The ABA insensitivity of stomatal
closure found by Webb et al. under these conditions [89]therefore can be attributed to a combination of multiple
perturbations (of Ca
2þ
celevation, Kþefﬂux, and anion efﬂux)
and is consistent with the predictions of our model.
Our model indicates that double perturbations of the Ca2þ
ATPase component and either of RCN1, OST1, NO, NOS,
NIA12, or Atrboh are hyposensitive (see Figure 7), consistent
with experimental results on disruptions in the lattercomponents [12,13,18,19,21,91]. Since the latter disruptions
alone, with unperturbed Ca
2þATPase, are found to have a
close-to-normal response in our model, a Ca2þATPase–disrupted and therefore Ca2þ
coscillation–free model seems
to be closer to experimental observations on stomatalaperture response recorded for these individual mutantgenotypes. This suggests that Ca
2þ
celevation (and not Ca2þ
c
oscillation) is the signal perceived by downstream factors that
control the induction of closure. Possibly, certain as-yet-undiscovered interaction motifs, such as a synergistic feed-
forward loop [92] or dual positive feedback loops [93], could
transform the Ca
2þ
coscillation into a stable downstream
output.
Limitations of the Current Analysis
Network topology. Our graph reconstruction is incom-
plete, as new signaling molecules will certainly be discovered.
Novel nodes may give identity to the intermediary nodes thatour model currently incorporates. Discovery of a newinteraction among known nodes could simplify the graph
by reducing (apparent) redundancy. For example, if it is
found that GPA1 !OST1, the simplest interpretation of the
ABA !ROS pathway becomes ABA !GPA1 !OST1 !
ROS, and the graph loses one edge and an alternative
pathway. As an effect, the graph’s robustness will be
attenuated. Among likely candidates for network reductionare the components currently situated immediately down-stream of ABA because, in the absence of information about
guard cell ABA receptors [94], we assumed that ABA
independently regulates eight components. It is also possiblethat a newly found interaction will not change the existing
edges, but only add a new edge. A newly added positive
regulation edge will further increase the redundancy ofsignaling and correspondingly its robustness. Newly addedinhibitory edges could possibly damage the network’s robust-
ness if they affect the main positive regulators of the network,
especially anion channels and membrane depolarization. Forexample, experimental evidence indicates that abi1 abi2
double recessive mutants are more sensitive to ABA-induced
stomatal closure than abi1 orabi2 single recessive mutants
[29], suggesting that ABI1 and ABI2 act synergistically. Due tolimited experimental evidence, we do not explicitly incorpo-rate ABI2, but an independent inhibitory effect of ABI2
would diminish ABA signaling.
While it is difﬁcult to estimate the changes in our
conclusions due to future knowledge gain, we can gauge the
robustness of our results by randomly deleting entries inTable S1 or rewiring edges of Figure 2 (see Texts S2 and S3).
We ﬁnd that most of the predicted important nodes are
documented in more than one entry, and more than oneentry needs to be removed from the database before thetopology of the network related to that node changes (Text
S2). Random rewiring of up to four edge pairs shows that the
dynamics of our current network is moderately resilient tominor topology changes (Text S3 and Figure S1).
Dynamic model. In our dynamic model we do not place
restrictions on the relative timing of individual interactionsbut sample all possible updates randomly. This approach
reﬂects our lack of knowledge concerning the relative
reaction speeds as well as possible environmental noise. Thesigniﬁcance of our current results is the prediction thatwhatever the timing is, given the current topology of
regulatory relationships in the network, the most essential
regulators will not change. Our approach can be iterativelyreﬁned when experimental results on the strength and timing

Model of Guard Cell ABA Signaling
of individual interactions become available. For example, we
can combine Boolean regulation with continuous synthesisand degradation of small molecules or signal transductionproteins [95,96] as kinetic (rate) data emerge. Our model
considers the response of individual guard cell pairs to the
local ABA signal; however, there is recent evidence of asynchronized oscillatory behavior of stomatal apertures over
spatially extended patches in response to a decrease in
humidity [97]. Our model can be extended to incorporatecell-to-cell signaling and spatial aspects by including extrac-ellular regulators when information about them becomes
available (see [51]).
Node disruptions. A knockout may either deprive the
system of an essential signaling element (the gene itself), or it
may ‘‘set ’’the entire system into a different state (e.g., by
affecting the baseline expression of
other, seemingly unre-
lated signaling elements). Our analysis and current exper-
imental data only address the former. Because of this caveat,
in some ways rapid pharmacological inhibition may actuallyhave a more speciﬁc effect on the cell than gene knockouts.
Implications
Many of the signaling proteins present as nodes in our
model are represented by multigene families in Arabidopsis
[98], with likely functional redundancy among encodedisoforms. Therefore, the amount of experimental workrequired to completely disrupt a given node may be
considerable. It is also considerable work to make such
genetic modiﬁcation in many of the important crop speciesthat are much less amenable than Arabidopsis to genetic
manipulation. It is also the case that, at present, there are no
reports of successful use of ratiometric pH indicators in thesmall guard cells of Arabidopsis, suggesting that further
technical advances in this area are required. Facts such as
these indicate the importance of establishing a prioritization
of node disruption in experimental studies seeking tomanipulate stomatal responses for either an increase in basicknowledge or an improvement in crop water use efﬁciency.
Our model provides information on which such prioritiza-
tion can be based. Future work on this model will focus onpredicting the changes in ABA-induced closure upon con-stitutive activation of network components or in the face of
ﬂuctuating ABA signals. Ultimately, the experimental infor-
mation obtained may or may not support the modelpredictions; the latter instance provides new information
that can be used to improve the model. Through such
iteration of in silico and wet bench approaches, a morecomplete understanding of complex signaling cascades canbe obtained.
Approaches to describe the dynamics of biological net-
works include differential equations based on mass-action
kinetics for the production and decay of all components
[99,100], and stochastic models that address the deviationsfrom population homogeneity by transforming reaction ratesinto probabilities and concentrations into numbers of
molecules [101]. The great complexity of many cellular signal
transduction networks makes it a daunting task to recon-struct all the reactions and regulatory interactions in suchexplicit biochemical and kinetic detail. Our work offers a
roadmap for synthesizing incompletely described signal
transduction and regulatory networks utilizing networktheory and qualitative stochastic dynamic modeling. Inaddition to being the practical choice, qualitative dynamic
descriptions are well suited for networks that need tofunction robustly despite changes in external and internalparameters. Indeed, several analyses found that the dynamicsof network motifs crucial for the stable dynamics and noise-
resistance of cellular networks, such as single input modules,
feed-forward loops [102,103] and dual positive feedback loops[93], is correctly and completely captured by qualitativemodeling [104,105]. For example, at the regulatory modulelevel, several qualitative (Boolean and continuous/discretehybrid) models [51,53,96] reproduced the Drosophila segment
polarity gene network’s resilience when facing variations inkinetic parameters [50], offering the most natural explan-ation of which parameter sets will succeed in forming thecorrect gene expression pattern [106]. We expect that ourmethods will ﬁnd extensive applications in systems wheremodeling is currently not possible by traditional approachesand that they will act as a scaffold on which more quantitativeanalyses of guard cell signaling in particular and cell signalingin general can later be built.
Our analyses have clear implications for the design of future
wet bench experiments investigating the signaling network ofguard cells and for the translation of experimental results onmodel species such as Arabidopsis to the improvement of water
use efﬁciency and drought tolerance in crop species [107–109]. Drought stress currently provides one of the greatestlimitations to crop productivity worldwide [110,111], and thisissue is of even more concern given current trends in globalclimate change [112,113]. Our methods also have implicationsin biomedical sciences. The use of systems modeling tools indesigning new drugs that overcome the limitation of tradi-tional medicine has been suggested in the recent literature[114]. Many human diseases, such as breast cancer [115] oracute myeloid leukemia [116,117], cause complex alterationsto the underlying signal transduction networks. Pathwayinformation relevant to human disease etiologies has beenaccumulated over decades and such information is stored inseveral databases such as TRANSPATH [118], BioCarta (http://
www.biocarta.com), and STKE ( http://www.stke.org). Our
strategy can serve as a tool that guides experiments byintegrating qualitative data, building systems models, andidentifying potential drug targets.

1% sucrose. Seedlings were grown vertically under short-day
conditions (8 h light/16 h dark) 120 lmol m/C02s/C01for 10 d. Vigorous
seedlings were selected for transplantation into soil and were grownto 5 wk of age (from germination) under short day conditions (8 hlight/16 h dark). Leaves were harvested 30 min after the lights wereturned on in the growth chamber.
Stomatal aperture measurements. Leaves were incubated in 20 mM
KCl, 5 mM Mes-KOH, and 1 mM CaCl
2(pH 6.15) (Tris), at room
temperature and kept in the light (250 lmol m/C02s/C01) for 2 h to open
stomata. For pH cclamping, different amounts of Na-butyrate stock
solution (made up as 1M solution in water [pH 6.1]) were added intothe incubation solution, to achieve the concentrations given in Figure8, 15 min before adding 50 lM ABA. Apertures were recorded after
2.5 h of further incubation in light. Epidermal peels were prepared atthe end of each treatment. The maximum width of each stomatalpore was measured under a microscope ﬁtted with an ocularmicrometer.

ABSTRACT
Systems models of biological networks show promise for in-
forming drug target selection/qualification, identifying lead com-
pounds and factors regulating disease progression, rationalizingcombinatorial regimens, and explaining sources of intersubjectvariability and adverse drug reactions. However, most models of
biological systems are qualitative and are not easily coupled
with dynamical models of drug e xposure-response relation-
ships. In this proof-of-concept s tudy, logic-based modeling of
signal transduction pathways in U266 multiple myeloma (MM)
cells is used to guide the development of a simple dynamical
model linking bortezomib exposure to cellular outcomes.Bortezomib is a commonly used first-line agent in MM
treatment; however, knowledge of the signal transduction
pathways regulating bortezomib -mediated cell cytotoxicity is
incomplete. A Boolean network model of 66 nodes was con-structed that includes major survival and apoptotic pathwaysand was updated using responses to several chemical probes.
Simulated responses to bortezomib were in good agreement
with experimental data, and a reduction algorithm was used toidentify key signaling proteins. Bortezomib-mediated apoptosiswas not associated with suppression of nuclear factor kB (NF kB)
protein inhibition in this cell line, which contradicts a major
hypothesis of bortezomib pharmacodynamics. A pharmacody-namic model was developed that included three critical proteins(phospho-NF kB, BclxL, and cleaved poly (ADP ribose) polymer-
ase). Model-fitted protein dynamics and cell proliferation profiles
agreed with experimental data, and the model-predicted IC
50
(3.5 nM) is comparable to the experimental value (1.5 nM). The
cell-based pharmacodynamic model successfully links bortezomib
exposure to MM cellular proliferation via protein dynamics, andthis model may show utility in exploring bortezomib-basedcombination regimens.
Introduction
The fields of systems biology and pharmacokinetic (PK)/
pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling have evolved largely in
parallel, and there is an emerging consensus that an effective
integration of these disciplines is needed to fully realize thepromise of each in bringing new therapeutic molecules and
combination regimens to the bedside (http://www.nigms.nih.
gov/Training/Documents/SystemsPharmaWPSorger2011.pdf).Traditional PK/PD models of drug action use compartmen-
tal structures to integrate the time course of drug exposure,
pharmacological properties (capacity, sensitivity, and transduc-tion of drug-target interactions) , and (patho)physiological turn-
over processes (Mager et al., 2003). Such semimechanistic
models contain a minimal number of identifiable parametersto describe temporal profiles of macroscale therapeutic andadverse drug effects. When coupled with nonlinear mixed-
effects modeling of relatively large clinical trials, a covariate
analysis can be used to identify patient-specific characteristics
(e.g., genetic polymorphisms) that explain the interindividual
variability in model parameters (Pillai et al., 2005). Although
a major component of model-informed drug development and
therapeutics (Milligan et al., 2013), this approach can be limited
by specific study designs and is rarely sufficient for recapitu-
lating multiple, complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
Significant insights have been realized from the recognition
that both drugs and disease processes give rise to complex and
dynamic clinical phenotypes by altering natural intercon-
nected biochemical networks and support the emergence of
systems pharmacology models of drug action (Zhao and
Iyengar, 2012; Huang et al., 2013; Jusko, 2013). Multiscale
models that combine PK/PD principles and signaling net-
works can serve as a platform for integrating genomic/
proteomic factors that regulate drug effects and clinical out-
comes —so-called enhanced PD (ePD) models (Iyengar et al.,
2012). Two major challenges to the development of ePD
models include the lack of complete mathematical models of
signal transduction networks (e.g., concentrations and re-
action rate constants) and unknown quantitative relationshipsThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health National

between individual genomic/pro teomic differences and model
parameters. Mechanistic network models are preferred over
empirical structures (Birtwistle et al., 2013); however, suchmodels may not be defined or calibrated to specific pharmaco-logical and/or disease systems. Logic-based modeling tech-
niques provide a global perspective of system properties in
the absence of kinetic parameters through the integration ofqualitative a priori knowledge of network connections (Albert
and Wang, 2009). In this proof-of-concept study, a reduction
algorithm is applied to a mathematical network to guide thedevelopment of a small signaling model for bortezomib, a potent
proteasome inhibitor, which may ultimately serve as an ePD
model for its use in multiple myeloma (MM).
Multiple myeloma is a B cell neoplasm associated with
several comorbidities, including hypercalcemia, renal insuffi-
ciency, anemia, and bone lesions (Caers et al., 2008; Bladeet al., 2010). The prognosis for advanced stages of MM is poordespite multiple treatment options, with a median survival of
advanced-stage patients of less than 10 months (Richardson
et al., 2003, 2005). Bortezomib is commonly prescribed aloneor in combination with other antimyeloma agents (Oancea
et al., 2004), and the addition of bortezomib has significantly
improved overall survival of MM patients (Caers et al., 2008).However, almost all patients relapse and become refractory to
all treatment options (Richardson et al., 2005; San Miguel
et al., 2008), and a better understanding of MM diseaseprogression and mechanisms of drug action is critical forimproving the treatment of MM.
Bortezomib modulates both survival and apoptotic cellular
pathways in MM cells (Fig. 1), and multiple mechanisms ofaction are proposed for inducing cell death, including the
inhibition of proteasome and the phospho –nuclear factor kB
(pNF kB) pathway (Hideshima et al., 2001, 2002, 2003a,b).
However, recent reports suggest that bortezomib stimulates
receptor-interacting protein (RIP; a signaling protein up-
stream of the NF kB pathway), leading to activation of pNF kBprotein expression (Hideshima et al., 2009). Despite extensive
qualitative information on bortezomib-induced intracellular
signaling, mathematical models linking bortezomib exposureto intracellular protein dynamics have not been established.Systems-level modeling may facilitate the rational design of
single and combinatorial dosing regimens, approaches to
overcome drug resistance, and prevent suboptimal dosing(Berger and Iyengar, 2011; Zhao and Iyengar, 2012). Mecha-
nistic models are emerging in which chemotherapy exposure is
connected to ultimate responses through target occupancy andbiomarker signal transduction (Yamazaki et al., 2011; Harrold
et al., 2012; Kay et al., 2012; Kirouac et al., 2013). The purpose
of this study is to integrate network systems analysis and PK/PDmodeling principles to study bor tezomib effects on signal trans-
duction in MM cells. Although the current study is conducted in
U266 cells, the strategic framework may be extended to other celllines and applied to other therapeutic areas.

RPMI 1640 and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection.
Cell Culture Experimental Design. All experiments were con-
ducted in U266 myeloma cells. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 15% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
antibiotics. Treatment protocols included 1) IKKi (10 mM), 2) JAKi
(10mM), 3) I kBi (10 mM), 4) IKKi and JAKi (10 mMe a c h ) ,5 )I kBi and
JAKi (10 mM each), 6) bortezomib (20 and 2 nM), and 7) dimethylsulf-
oxide vehicle control. All treatments were continuous for 48 hours, with
the exception of I kBi experiments (10 hours). A transient exposure to
bortezomib (20 nM) was also conducted, in which cells were incubated foreither 1 or 2 hours followed by removal of drug from the culture media
and subsequent incubation with v ehicle control for up to 48 hours.
WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay. Approximately 10,000 cells per
well were incubated with a range of concentrations (0.001 –100mM) of
JAKi, IKKi, or a combination of IKKi and JAKi. Incubation experi-
ments with bortezomib alone ranged from 0.001 to 100 nM. Cellviability was measured at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours according tomanufacturer instructions. Absorbance was measured at 450 and
690 nm after 2-hour incubation with WST-1 reagent with a Microplate
spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, CA).
Western Blot Analysis. Relative protein expression levels of
pStat3, pNF kB, pI kBa, cleaved PARP, and BclxL were measured
following treatment regimens as specified in Supplemental Table 1.
Cells (5 /C210
6/10 ml culture media) were incubated in 10-cm2culture
dishes. Cells were collected at the end of the treatment duration, washed
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed at 4°C in radio-
immunoprecipitation assay RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology)supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Bio-Rad) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Bio-Rad). Protein lysates were
stored at 280°C until used. Equal amounts of proteins were separated
on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.Immunoblotting was performed according to manufacturer instruc-tions, and the relative intensity of bands was assessed by densito-
metric analysis of digitized images using ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD). All experiments were conducted in at least duplicate.
Drug Stability. Bortezomib degradation in cell culture was
assessed at different time points (0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours).
Bortezomib concentrations were measured after incubation (20 nM) at
37°C in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% FBS and1% penicillin/streptomycin) using a liquid chromatography –tandem
mass spectrometry assay previously validated in our laboratory (un-
published). Bortezomib degradation kinetics were fit with a monoexpo-nential ( l) decay model, and the half-life was calculated as ln(2)/ l.
Boolean Network Assembly and Simulations. The Boolean
network model (Supplemental Fig. 1) was drawn with SmartDraw
software (http://www.smartdraw.com) and was implemented in Odefy(http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/cmb/odefy) (Wittmann et al.,2009), a toolbox compatible with MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick,
MA). Odefy converts Boolean relationships into a continuous frame-
work using a Hill-type function. In the hypothetical case in which nodeB stimulates A, the relationship can be described by
dA=dt51=t½B
n=ðBn1knÞ2A:/C138
Default parameter values for k(0.5), n(3), and t(1) were used for all
nodes. All model simulations were performed using the “HillCubeNorm ”
option within Odefy (MATLAB model code is provided in the Data
Supplement). Each node in the model was initialized as ON (1) or OFF
(0) based on baseline activity in the cell. For example, if the state isconstitutively active in the cell, it was initialized as 1. Boolean transferfunctions and initial state values are summarized in Supplemental
Table 2. Examples of ordinary differential equations corresponding to
each node, which were generated using Odefy, are listed in SupplementalEqs. 1 –5.
Three specific probes, JAKi, I kBi, and IKKi, were used to develop
and update the network model. The effect of the JAKi was added suchthat it inhibits nodes JAK1 and JAK2. The I kBi inhibitor was added by
direct inhibition of pI kB node activation. Similarly, the IKKi effect was
added such that it inhibits node IKK. Model simulations wereperformed to predict bortezomib outcomes, and drug effect was in-
corporated as direct inhibition of the proteasome node and stimulation
of the RIP node. For simulations of transient bortezomib exposure, thebortezomib node was activated for only one or two iterations.
Network Reduction. The final full Boolean network model de-
veloped for U266 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1) was reduced using
a model reduction algorithm (Veliz-Cuba, 2011) to identify criticalproteins involved in bortezomib-mediated signal transduction.Figure 2 shows examples of the steps taken to reduce the network.
First, nodes with only one input and one output are eliminated and the
pathways are reconnected (Fig. 2A). For example, RAF was removedand RAS and MEK1 were directly connected (Fig. 2B). In another
network reduction rule, nonfunctional edges are identified and re-
moved based on the Boolean relationships ( algorithm Sf r o m
Veliz-Cuba, 2011). For example, Fig. 2C shows nodes A, B, and C,with the following Boolean functions: f(A) 5B OR (B AND NOT C), f(B)
5(A AND C), and f(C) 5A. Hence, node C is nonfunctional in f(A)
because of the “OR”relationship, and the B node is sufficient to elicit
the same effect without invoking C. The resulting diagram is shown(block arrow, Fig. 2C) with the Boolean relationships: f(A) 5B, f(B) 5
(A AND C), and f(C) 5A. p21 is an example of nonfunctional edges
(Fig. 2D), and Boolean relationships for p21 [f(p21) 5p53 AND (NOT
AKT OR NOT MDM OR NOT MYC OR NOT CKD4)] were refined
using step 2 to f(p21) 5p53 AND NOT AKT to remove nonfunctional
edges. AKT is the sole connection to BAD; therefore, the p21connection to AKT is retained (Fig. 2D).
Finally, nonfunctional nodes are identified and removed from the
network ( algorithm R from Veliz-Cuba, 2011). Before applying this
rule, the network is rewired and the first rule is reapplied. Nodes thatdo not have any impact on other nodes are considered nonfunctionaland are removed. In Fig. 2E, node C is regulating node B, but at the
same time node A is regulating node C. Therefore, the connection from
node C to B can be removed, and consequently node C can be removed.As an example, the only node modulated by MYC is CYCE, as the MYCconnection to CYCD can be removed because of the AKT connection to
CYCD (Fig. 2F). pStat3, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase stimulate MYC independently,and mitogen-activated protein kinase was removed following the first
network reduction rule (Fig. 2A). Similarly, extracellular signal-
regulated kinase was removed as it does not modulate any other nodebesides MYC. pStat3 modulates several other nodes (e.g., BclxL andXIAP) and stimulates MYC. MYC can be removed following the one
input –one output rule, and therefore, CYCE is directly modulated by
pStat3 (Fig. 2F), resulting in four final nodes. This entire process wasrepeated until no further nodes could be removed from the Booleannetwork. Boolean simulations of the final reduced network were
compared with simulations of the full network using Odefy (Wittmann
et al., 2009).
Dynamical Model Development. Several critical proteins iden-
tified using the model reduction algorithm were incorporated into
a reduced cellular PD model based on mechanisms of bortezomib actionand signal transduction pathways. The reduced dynamic model ofbortezomib is depicted in Fig. 3. In brief, bortezomib stimulates protein
expression of pNF kB and cleaved PARP (following delays) and inhibits
expression of BclxL. A transit compartment (M1
B)w a sa d d e dt oa c c o u n t
for the slight delay in stimulation of pNF kB protein expression (Mager
and Jusko, 2001). Bortezomib stimulates the synthesis rate of M1 B
(ksyn_M1B ) via a linear stimulation coefficient ( Sm_M1B ), and the rate of
change in expression of M1 Bis defined as follows:

order degradation rate constant of M1 B. pNF kB protein expression450 Chudasama et al.
increases but returns toward the baseline after 24 hours of continuous
bortezomib exposure. To capture this trend, a precursor-dependent
indirect response model was proposed (Sharma et al., 1998), withstimulation of the first-order transfer rate constant from the precursorpool (pre_pNF kB) to the pNF kB compartment ( k
tr_NF kB). The rate of

Changes in cleaved PARP expression follow a significant delay, andthe protein expression profile was best characterized using a time-

Data Analysis. The dynamical model (Fig. 3) was first fitted to
mean pNF kB and cleaved PARP data, followed by pooling of all
relative changes in these protein expression patterns (naïve pooleddata approach). Initially, pNF kB and cleaved PARP protein dynamics
were fit separately. BclxL data were subsequently included, and all of
the data including BclxL, pNF kB, and cleaved PARP protein dynamics
were fitted simultaneously. Next, cell proliferation was introduced tothe existing cellular dynamic model, and all of the data (three
biomarkers and cell proliferation) were fitted simultaneously. The in
vitro degradation half-life of bortezomib was included for all modelruns. Parameters were estimated using MATLAB (fminsearch func-tion, maximum likelihood algorithm, and ode23s) and a model devel-
opment framework (Harrold and Abraham, 2014). All protein
dynamics were described using a proportional error variance model(Y
obs5Ypred ×s), and cell proliferation was fitted using an additive plus
proportional error variance model ( Yobs5Ypred ×s1«), where Yobsis
the observation at time t,Ypredis the model-predicted value at time t,
andsand«are estimated variance model parameters.Model Qualification. The final cell-based model and parameter
estimates were used to simulate protein dynamics and cell pro-
liferation after continuous exposure to a 10-fold-lower bortezomibconcentration (2 nM). Simulations were compared with the experi-
mentally measured cell proliferation and protein expression profiles.
Only parameters associated with natural cell proliferation ( k
gandkd)
were estimated. Cell proliferation was measured at 0, 24, 48, and72 hours, and protein expression measurements were made at 0, 1, 4,
6, 8, 11, 24, 33, and 48 hours. The final model was also used to predict
cell proliferation at 48 hours for a range of bortezomib concentrations(0.001 –100 nM). The experimentally estimated IC
50value was
compared with the IC 50obtained from the simulated data.
Results
Network Development with IKK and JAK Inhibitors.
The final Boolean network model incorporates major survivaland apoptotic pathways in U266 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1),
and Supplemental Table 2 summarizes all node descriptions,
Boolean internodal relationships, and initial values. Thegreen connections in Supplemental Fig. 1 indicate how theinitial network was updated based on cellular responses to the
pathway probes. Nodes that are constitutively active under
baseline cell conditions were set as being active (1) or other-wise inactive (0) in the network. An initial Boolean network
was constructed, and the performance of the initial model was
tested with two pathway-specific probes, IKKi and JAKi, toinhibit the NF kB and JAK/STAT pathways. In the Boolean
network, the effect of each inhibitor was added such that IKKi
inhibits node IKK, and JAKi inhibits nodes JAK1 and JAK2.Simulations of the initial Boolean network show that nodes
representing pI kBa, pNF kB, pStat3, and BclxL expression
decrease gradually upon inhibition of node IKK (Supplemen-tal Fig. 2A, black dash-dotted lines). Inhibition of pStat3expression appears to be due to interleukin-6 inhibition (major
stimulus of JAK/STAT3 pathway) via pNF kB expression.
However, in vitro Western blot experiments show thatexpressions of pNF kB, pStat3, and BclxL remained un-
changed after 48-hour exposure to the IKKi, whereas pI kBa
expression decreased (Supplemental Fig. 2B, black symbolsand dotted lines). In contrast, simulations of the same proteins
using the initial model following JAKi exposure (Supplemen-
tal Fig. 2A, green dashed lines) were comparable to observedexperimental profiles over 48 hours (Supplemental Fig. 2B,green symbols and dashed lines). To account for the observed
trend in pNF kB expression, the initial network was modified
such that pStat3 also stimulates pNF kB (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Although not yet confirmed in U266 or other MM cell lines,
studies suggest cross-talk between NF kB and STAT3 signaling
in tumors (Squarize et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2009; Saez-Rodriguezet al., 2011). To further test this hypothesis, model simulations
were compared for the combination of IKKi and JAKi treatment
with measured temporal expression profiles of pNF kB. Simu-
lations of pNF kB following combination treatment with JAKi
and IKKi using the initial Boolean network showed a steady
decrease over time (data not shown). However, pNF kBe x p r e s -
sion measured by Western blot a nalysis only transiently de-
creased with a return to baseline values (Supplemental Fig. 2B,
blue symbols and dash-dot lines). A detailed evaluation of
pNFkB is described in the next section. Overall, cellular protein
dynamic simulations using the final model (Supplemental Fig.
2C) reasonably agree with the experimental results (Supple-
mental Fig. 2B).

NFkB Dynamics. As the expression of pNF kB was not
suppressed by the IKKi, either as a single agent or in
combination with the JAKi, cellular responses to anotherNFkB pathway inhibitor (I kBi) were evaluated alone or in
combination with the JAKi. Using the initial Boolean net-
work, inhibition of node pI kBaby IkBi resulted in simulations
showing inhibition of pNF kB expression (data not shown).
However, continuous I kBi exposure to U266 cells for up to
10 hours (alone and in combination with JAKi) maintained
pIkBaexpression below baseline values (Supplemental Fig.
3A), whereas pNF kB expression transiently decreased fol-
lowed by a steady increase above the baseline (Supplemental
Fig. 3A). Based on the lack of pNF kB suppression with either
the IKKi or I kBi, alone or in combination with JAKi,
additional factors were assumed to govern pNF kB expression
in U266 cells outside of IKK, pI kBa, and pStat3 signaling.
This phenomenon was emulated by incorporating a dummynode “X”to constantly stimulate pNF kB in the final network
(Supplemental Fig. 1). The addition of this factor stabilized
the Boolean network and reconciled simulations (Supplemen-tal Fig. 2, C, D, and F) with all experimental data (Supple-
mental Fig. 2, B, E, and G). These results highlight the need to
inhibit NF kB activity directly rather than through upstream
pathways. Both final model simulations and experimental
data confirm inhibition of pI kBaexpression following contin-
uous 48-hour exposure to the IKKi (10 mM), as well as the lack
of suppression of pNF kB and BclxL expression levels (Sup-
plemental Fig. 2, B and C, black symbols and dotted lines).
Analogously, continuous exposure to the JAKi (10 mM) sup-
pressed expression of pStat3, whereas pNF kB and BclxL
expression levels remained unchanged (Supplemental Fig. 2,
B and C, green symbols and dashed lines). In addition, final
model simulations of U266 cellular proliferation and apoptosisagreed well with experimental cellular responses (Supple-
mental Fig. 2, D –G). A range of IKKi and JAKi concentrations
(0.001 –100 mM) was used to evaluate cell viability, and
neither induction of apoptosis nor decreased cell viability
was observed after 72-hour continuous exposure alone or in
combination (Supplemental Fig. 2, E and G).
Bortezomib Pharmacodynamics. Once the final Bool-
ean network model was updated using protein dynamics and
cellular responses after exposures to probe inhibitors, the
model was used to evaluate bortezomib pharmacodynamics.
Bortezomib effect was introduced into the network such that it
directly inhibits the “proteasome ”node and stimulates the
“RIP ”node (Supplemental Fig. 1). Stimulation of RIP acti-
vates a downstream cascade, leading to activation of pI kBa
followed by pNF kB. In the Boolean network, a state initialized
as 1 (active) cannot be further stimulated; therefore, pI kBa
and pNF kB signal intensities remain unchanged (Supplemen-
tal Fig. 4A, blue dash-dot line). However, our immunoblot
analysis revealed transient increases in pNF kB and pI kBa
expression levels, followed by a gradual return to baselinevalues (Supplemental Fig. 4B, blue symbols and lines), which
is in agreement with published profiles (Hideshima et al.,
2009). Comparing steady-state values for pNF kB and pI kBa
before and after treatment suggests no change in expression
levels, which is in agreement with Boolean network simula-
tions (Supplemental Fig. 4A). Furthermore, inhibition ofproteasome results in accumulated cellular stress that acti-
vates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway as well as
the apoptotic pathway. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathwayactivates caspase-3, leading to activation of p53 followed by
p21, resulting in the inhibition of the Bcl-2 family proteins
(e.g., BclxL and Bcl-2) (Supplemental Fig. 4B, blue symbols
and lines). The activated JNK pathway inversely regulatespStat3, leading to downregulation of pStat3 expression (Sup-
plemental Fig. 4B, blue symbols and lines). Simulations using
the final Boolean network model correctly predicted theinhibition of pStat3 and BclxL in U266 cells after bortezomib
exposure (Supplemental Fig. 4A, blue symbols and lines). In
addition, final model simulations of U266 cellular outcomes tobortezomib exposure were in good agreement with in vitro
measurements of cell viability and apoptosis measured via
cleaved PARP expression (Fig. 4).
To further test the fidelity of the Boolean network model to
predict bortezomib pharmacodynamics, we compared Boolean
network simulations with experimental results of cellular
responses upon transient bortezomib exposures. Simulationsof transient drug exposure were achieved by maintaining the
Bortezomib node as active (1 5ON) for a limited number of
iterations, and the dynamics and steady states of protein andcellular response nodes were monitored. Transient experi-
ments were conducted in which U266 cells were briefly
exposed (i.e., for 1 and 2 hours) to bortezomib. Interestingly,some nodes (e.g., proteasome) returned to baseline values oncebortezomib was removed from the system, whereas other
nodes (e.g., cleaved PARP or Cl. PARP) achieved a new steady
state even after drug was removed. Furthermore, steady-stateoutcomes for several nodes varied depending on the duration
of simulated bortezomib exposure. For example, a relatively
short duration of proteasome suppression produces a transientinduction of apoptosis, whereas longer durations of bortezomib
exposure resulted in steady states of apoptosis induction and
inhibited cell growth that are similar to simulated outcomes

outcomes with continuous bortezomib exposure. (A) Cell proliferationover 96 hours after bortezomib (20 nM) exposure in U266 cells. (B) Time

following continuous drug exposure. A shorter duration of
bortezomib exposure was associated with a delay in apoptosis
induction as compared with continuous drug exposure (Supple-mental Fig. 5A), and similar trends were observed experimen-tally (Supplemental Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis of BclxL
and cleaved PARP expression shows a reduced magnitude in
changes from baseline values between transient and continu-ous bortezomib exposure. The magnitude of cleaved PARP
induction was reduced from 22- to 6-fold after 24 hours of
bortezomib treatment. Model simulations of selected proteinswere comparable with experimental results (Supplemental Fig.
5, A and B). However, stimulation of cleaved PARP is associated
with apoptosis induction, downregulation of total NF kBe x -
pression, and subsequent suppression of pNF kBe x p r e s s i o n .I n
contrast, incubation of U266 cells with bortezomib (20 nM) for
2 hours failed to inhibit pNF kB expression (Supplemental Fig.
5C, bottom), despite activation of cleaved PARP for over48 hours (Supplemental Fig. 5B, apoptosis, black triangles). A
specific threshold of cleaved PARP activation might be required
to inhibit NF kB expression, which is not incorporated into the
current network model, and further studies are needed to test
this hypothesis.
Network Reduction. A Boolean network reduction ap-
proach (Veliz-Cuba, 2011) identified eight critical nodes
(Supplemental Fig. 6A), five of which are survival pathway
nodes (AKT, pNF kB, BclxL, proteasome, and pRB) and three
are apoptotic pathway nodes (caspase-3, JNK, and p21).Boolean simulations of the reduced network are identical to
the steady-state values of the full network, which further
supports the reduction algorithm (Supplemental Fig. 6B).Although caspase-3 was identified as a critical protein through
the Boolean network reduction, cleaved PARP expression was
measured as a marker for apoptosis due to caspase-3 assaylimitations.
Bortezomib Cellular Pharmacodynamic Model. Three
critical proteins (i.e., pNF kB, BclxL, and cleaved PARP) were
selected from the reduced Boolean network model (Supplemen-
tal Fig. 6A) for measurement and inclusion in the cellular
pharmacodynamic model. The final cellular model (Fig. 3)integrates the time courses of bortezomib exposure, proteindynamics, and cell proliferation. Bortezomib elicits its effects on
pNFkB via stimulation of upstream proteins in the pNF kB
pathway and on cleaved PARP via stress accumulation due toproteasome inhibition. Upon continuous exposure of U266 cells
to bortezomib, pNF kB protein expression is stimulated after
a slight delay with a return toward the baseline (Fig. 5A). Theslight delay in the stimulation of pNF kB was well characterized
by adding a simple transit compartment (M1
B;E q s .1a n d2 ) .
pNFkB expression was well described by a precursor model, in
which the delayed signal (M1 B) stimulates the first-order
transfer from the precursor to the pNF kB compartment (Eqs.
2 and 3). Parameters associated with M1 Band pNF kB(kdeg_M1B
andSm_M1B ) were not estimated with good precision; therefore,
M1B-associated parameters were fixed to the estimates during
an initial model run. This had no impact on model performance
(i.e., model fits were not compromised and parameter values didnot change substantially), but precision of the estimated
parameters was significantly improved (Table 1). A relatively
long delay was observed before cleaved PARP expressionincreased (Fig. 5B), and a transit-compartment model was
selected to describe this delay. Four transit compartments were
found to be adequate, and the total transit time was wellestimated at 26.8 hours (Table 1, k
tr_parp ). BclxL expression
starts decreasing after 12 hours (Fig. 5C), and this delay was
also well characterized by the proposed model. The initial phaseof BclxL was maintained at steady state by pNF kB, and the
eventual decrease in BclxL expression was successfully de-
scribed using cleaved PARP stimulation of the BclxL degrada-
tion rate constant. An exponential growth model well capturedthe natural cell proliferation under control conditions (Fig. 5D,
triangles). The final signal transduction model reasonably
captured the delay in cell death, and parameters were esti-mated with good precision (Table 1). Overall, the pharmacody-
namic model well characterized the time courses of protein
expression and cell proliferation profiles after exposure tobortezomib at 20 nM.
Sensitivity to Dose and Model Qualification. The final
pharmacodynamic model (Fig. 3) was developed using severalcellular biomarkers after continuous exposure to a single,relatively high concentration of bortezomib (20 nM). Simu-
lations of protein expression profiles and cell proliferation
following exposure to different bortezomib concentrations(0.1–20 nM) were performed to evaluate the role of bortezomib
dose in cellular outcomes (Supplemental Fig. 7). As bortezomib
concentration is increased, the magnitude of pNF kB expression
is also increased, and the time to peak response is decreased
(Supplemental Fig. 7A). The extent of induced cleaved PARP is
also increased (Supplemental Fig. 7B), along with greatersuppression of BclxL expression (Supplemental Fig. 7C) asbortezomib concentration increases. For cell proliferation, cell
growth is suppressed up to 2 nM (Supplemental Fig. 7D, red
line), but greater concentrations result in cell death (Supple-mental Fig. 7D). As an external predictive check, protein ex-
pression profiles and cell prolifer ation after low-dose bortezomib
exposure (2 nM) were measured and compared with modelsimulations, which were obtained using the final model (Fig. 3)
and parameter estimates (Table 1) from the high-dose
bortezomib (20 nM) experiments. The low concentration ofbortezomib (2 nM) was chosen, as it is close to its IC
50value
(1.5 nM) from the in vitro exposure-response relationship at
48 hours. Thus, the selected concentration is relatively lowbut should still elicit a pharmacological response. Model-predicted pNF kB, cleaved PARP, and BclxL profiles and cell
proliferation dynamics are in good agreement with the
experimental data (Supplemental Fig. 8).
The final model was also used to predict the IC
50for
bortezomib after 48 hours of continuous exposure. Although
the model was developed based on temporal profiles aftera single concentration of bortezomib, the model-predicted IC
50
was comparable to that obtained f rom the in vitro concentration-
effect experiments (3.5 versus 1.5 nM; Fig. 6).
Discussion
Network-based approaches are increasingly used in drug
discovery and development (Csermely et al., 2013; Harrold
et al., 2013). Pharmacological networks are now commonlyused for target identification (Sahin et al., 2009), evaluatingsignaling networks between normal and diseased conditions
(Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2011), and understanding interactions
among pathways (Thakar et al., 2007; Ge and Qian, 2009; Maiand Liu, 2009). For example, a Boolean network was used to
identify novel targets to overcome trastuzumab resistance in
breast cancer cell lines (Sahin et al., 2009), in which c-MYC454 Chudasama et al.
was identified as a potential therapeutic target. In another
example, Boolean network modeling was used to analyze
immune responses due to the presence of virulence factors inlower respiratory tract infection (Thakar et al., 2007). Threedistinct phases of Bordetellae infection were identified, which
was not possible using traditional experimental methods
(i.e., biochemical and molecular biology techniques). A similarapproach is used in the present analysis, in which a Boolean
network model is applied for evaluating bortezomib signal
transduction pathways in U266 cells.Our initial Boolean network model was developed based on
the literature; however, available studies focus on either
NFkB (Bharti et al., 2003b) or JAK/STAT3 (Bharti et al.,
2003a; Park et al., 2011) pathways independently, and jointeffects of these pathways have not been previously evaluated
in U266 cells (e.g., apoptosis and cell proliferation). In
addition, cellular protein dynamics and outcomes followingexposure to specific probe compounds were also unavailable.
Therefore, in vitro experiments and computational modeling
were combined with pathway-specific inhibitors to evaluate

the roles of both pathways individually and simultaneously.
The Boolean network model confirmed that stress accumula-tion due to proteasome inhibition is a major pathway of
myeloma cell death despite the activation of pNF kB protein
expression, which contradicts a major proposed hypothesis ofbortezomib effects.
Whereas logic-based models provide qualitative insight into
network connectivity and drug-induced signal transduction,a quantitative dynamical model that includes important
cellular biomarkers allows for the integration of critical
factors responsible for cell death upon chemotherapy exposure(Yamazaki et al., 2011; Kay et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). Itis not yet practical to quantify all components in cellular
signaling pathways; therefore, it is necessary to identify
critical proteins for dynamical model development. A Booleannetwork reduction algorithm (Veliz-Cuba, 2011) identified
critical factors regulating bortezomib cell death that guided
development of a reduced PD model. Among the biomarkers(Supplemental Fig. 6), two antiapoptotic proteins and one
proapoptotic protein (pNF kB, BclxL, and cleaved PARP) were
integrated into a reduced pharmacodynamic model (Fig. 3).pNFkB was integrated in the model as bortezomib increases
its expression, contradictory to proposed mechanisms. BclxL
was selected as a major antiapoptotic protein that inhibitsapoptosis, and cleaved PARP is a primary proapoptoticmarker. The factor p21 was not incorporated in the current
model as Boolean simulations suggest that bortezomib effects
on apoptosis precede cell growth arrest.
The final cellular PD model (Fig. 3) was successfully
qualified using the external data set following a low concen-
tration of bortezomib (2 nM). Despite the fact that the cellularmodel was developed based on a single bortezomib concentra-
tion (20 nM) and linear coefficients, the final model reasonably
predicted responses to the lower bortezomib exposure (Sup-plemental Fig. 8) and the dose-response curve for bortezomibat 48 hours (Fig. 6). Although there is a slight misfit for BclxL
and cleaved PARP profiles (Supplemental Fig. 8, B and C),
overall simulated profiles reasonably agree with experimentaldata. Most commonly, exposure-response relationships of
protein expression data are sigmoidal in nature (Bharti
et al., 2003a,b; Park et al., 2008, 2011). For example, theinhibition of pNF kB activity by curcumin is 10% at 1 mM and
40% at 10 mM (Bharti et al., 2003b). Similarly, cleaved PARP
activation is about 1% at 10 mM curcumin but 100% at 50 mMcurcumin (Park et al., 2008). It is therefore interesting that,
although our model was developed using a single drug
concentration and simple linear coefficients (e.g., S
m_M1B
andSm_PARP in Eqs. 1 and 4), it reasonably predicts profiles
at a lower bortezomib concentration (Supplemental Fig. 8) and
a sigmoidal concentration-effect relationship (Fig. 6). Further-
more, the predicted exposure-response relationship for BclxLcan be overlaid with observed cell proliferation at 48 hours
(Supplemental Fig. 9). This suggests that BclxL could serve as
a potential biomarker to predict efficacy in MM and warrantsfurther study. However, a potential limitation is that the
proteins measured in this study reflect relative fold change
and not absolute values of protein concentrations. Groundingon relative changes in protein expression maintains a degree
of modularity, but more advanced proteomic methods are
needed to quantitatively measure low-abundance signalingproteins. Cell growth and death parameters were also com-pared with available values from the literature. Natural cell
growth and death were modeled using first-order growth rate
constants ( k
gandkd). The estimated net growth rate constant
(kg–kd) in the final model (0.00490 h21) is comparable to net
growth rate constants from U266 xenografts at 0.00487 h21
(Siveen et al., 2014) and 0.00450 h21(Rhee et al., 2012) that
were obtained by fitting an exponential model to digitized
control curves (data not shown).
Preliminary experiments were conducted to measure
pNFkB in the nucleus and cytoplasm of U266 cells after
bortezomib exposure. Both cellular fractions showed a similar
trend of increased relative pNF kB expression (data not
shown); therefore, total cellular pNF kB was measured by
Western blot analysis of cell lysates, revealing transient
increased expression (Fig. 5A). Despite the stimulation of
pNFkB protein expression, apoptosis is induced and the model
is able to well capture this phenomenon. The NF kB pathway is
one of the major cell survival pathways and is deregulated in
many types of cancer (Karin, 2009). Bortezomib stimulates theupstream cascade of the NF kB pathway (Hideshima et al.,
2009) leading to activation of pNF kB protein expression.
Apoptosis is still induced through cellular stress resultingfrom the inhibition of proteasome (Fig. 4D) (Hideshima et al.,2001). The cellular model was able to well describe both
mechanisms. Aberrant expression of pNF kB is responsible for
the lack of efficacy and resistance in some cases of MM(Hideshima et al., 2002; Bharti et al., 2004). Greater expres-
sion of pNF kB results in greater expression of antiapoptotic
proteins (e.g., BclxL) (Karin and Lin, 2002), with cross-talkbetween survival and apoptotic pathways determining cellu-
lar fate. Hence, greater drug concentrations are required to
activate the apoptotic pathway. Initially, BclxL inhibition ofcleaved PARP activation and cleaved PARP stimulation onremoval of BclxL was incorporated. However, since BclxL
exerts a negative feedback on cell death, as incorporated in the
model, the BclxL effect on cleaved PARP was removed tosimplify the model and reduce model redundancy.
In summary, systems pharmacology is an emerging field
that seeks to couple systems biology and PD modeling, whichcould promote the discovery, development, and effective use of
drugs based upon first principles. Computational tools based
on graph theory (Liu et al., 2013), discrete dynamic relation-ships (Albert and Wang, 2009), and others can be used to
identify critical system components within networks at mul-
tiple organizational levels, thus providing guidance for

Abstract
Background: Structural analysis of cellular  interaction networks contribut es to a deeper understanding
of network-wide interdependencies,  causal relationships, and basic functional capabilities. While the
structural analysis of metabolic ne tworks is a well-established field, similar methodologies have been
scarcely developed and applied to signaling and regulatory networks.
Results: We propose formalisms and methods, relyin g on adapted and partially newly introduced
approaches, which facilitate a structural analysis of  signaling and regulatory  networks with focus on
functional aspects. We use two di fferent formalisms to represent and analyze interaction networks:
interaction graphs and (logical) interaction hypergraphs. We show that, in interaction graphs, the
determination of feedback cycles and of all the signaling paths between an y pair of species is equivalent to
the computation of elementary modes known from meta bolic networks. Knowledge on the set of signaling
paths and feedback loops fa cilitates the computation of intervention  strategies and the classification of
compounds into activa tors, inhibitors, ambivalent  factors, and non-af fecting factors with respect to a
certain species. In some cases, qu alitative effects induced by perturba tions can be unambiguously predicted
from the network scheme. Interaction  graphs however, are not able to  capture AND relationships which
do frequently occur in interaction networks. The cons equent logical concatenation of all the arcs pointing
into a species leads to Boolean ne tworks. For a Boolean representation  of cellular interaction networks
we propose a formalism based on logi cal (or signed) in teraction hypergraphs, which facilitates in particular
a logical steady state analysis (LSSA). LSSA enables studies on the logical processing of signals and the
identification of optimal interventi on points (targets) in cellular ne tworks. LSSA also reveals network
regions whose parametrization and initial st ates are crucial for the dynamic behavior.
We have implemented these me thods in our software tool CellNetAnalyzer (successor of FluxAnalyzer ) and
illustrate their applicability using a logical model of T-Cell receptor signaling prov iding non-intuitive results
regarding feedback loops, essential elements, and (logical) signal processing upon different stimuli.
Conclusion: The methods and formalisms we propose herein are another step towards the
comprehensive functional analysis of  cellular interaction networks. Thei r potential, shown on a realistic T-
cell signaling model, makes them a promising tool.Published: 07 February 2006

Background
Evolution has equipped cells with exquisite signaling sys-
tems which allow them to sense their environment,receive and process signals in a hierarchically organizedmanner and to react accordingly [1]. The complexity ofthe corresponding molecular machineries, in accordancewith the complicated tasks they have to perform, is over-
whelming. In the last few years, as a key element to the
growing popularity of systems biology, mathematicaltools have been applied to the analysis of signaling data[2]. Ordinary differential equations relying on kineticdescriptions of the underlying molecular interactions arearguably the most used approach for modeling signaling
networks (e.g. [3-6]). A number of theoretical methods
have been devised and employed for the reconstruction(reverse engineering) of signaling or, more generally,interaction networks (which may represent signaling butalso other types or abstractions of cellular networks suchas genetic regulatory networks) based on perturbationexperiments [7]. The approaches rely on methods ranging
from Bayesian networks (e.g. [8]) to metabolic control
analysis [9,10].
Relatively few methods have been proposed so far for ana-
lyzing the structure of a given signaling (or any interac-
tion) network. This is somewhat surprising since
structural analysis of metabolic networks is a well-estab-
lished field and proved to be successful to recognize rela-tionships between structure, function, and regulation ofmetabolic networks [11]. Structural analysis will be partic-ularly useful in large signaling networks, where a simplevisual inspection is not possible and at the same time the
construction of precise quantitative models is practically
infeasible due to the huge amount of required, but gener-ally unknown, kinetic parameters and concentration val-ues. However, the reconstruction of large signalingnetworks is still in its first stages [2,12].
Structural or qualitative approaches that have been
employed for interaction networks include statisticallarge-scale analyses in protein-protein networks (e.g.[13]). These studies are important for examining statisti-cal properties of the interaction graph and for understand-ing its global organization but they provide relatively fewinsights into the function of the network. Papin and co-
workers [14,15] were the first to adapt methods from the
constraint-based approach (frequently used for structuralanalysis of metabolic networks [11]) to analyze stoichio-metric models of signaling pathways. Recently, graph-the-oretical descriptions of signaling networks have beenexamined [16-18]. Finally, Boolean networks as discrete
approximations of quantitative models have been used
for logical analyses of small signaling networks e.g. [19].However, the majority of studies relying on the Booleanapproach deal with genetic interaction networks, many ofwhich have a relatively small size (ca. 10 species; e.g.
[20,21]), however, recently more complicated networks
have also been investigated [22,23].
In this contribution, we propose formalisms for represent-
ing signaling and other interaction networks mathemati-cally and present a collection of methods facilitating
structural analysis of the respective network models.
Rather than introducing completely new concepts, we willsystematize and adapt existing formalisms and methods,often motivated from structural analyses of metabolic net-works, towards a functional analysis of the structure of a
signaling network. Issues that can be addressed with the
proposed methods include:
 check of the plausibility and consistency of the network
structure
 identification of all or particular signaling pathways,
feedback loops and crosstalks
 network-wide functional interdependencies between
network elements
 identification of the different modes of (logical) input/
output behavior
 predicting responses (phenotypes) after changes in net-
work structure
 finding targets and intervention points in the network
for repressing or provoking a certain behavior or response
 analysis of structural network properties like redun-
dancy and robustness
Structural analysis is not based on quantitative and
dynamic properties and can thus only provide qualitative
answers. However, some insights into the dynamic prop-
erties can nevertheless often be obtained, because funda-mental properties of the dynamic behavior are oftengoverned by the network structure [24]. While we willfocus on signaling networks, the methods can be easilyapplied to any kind of interaction network, includinggene regulatory systems. Apart from a toy model, we will
exemplify our methods on a model of signaling pathways
in T-cells.
Results and discussion
Mass and signal flows in cellular interaction networks
The reader familiar to the structural analysis of stoichio-
metric networks may notice that, in the case of metabolic
networks, many of the issues in the task list of the previ-ous section have been handled by the constraint-basedapproach [11]. For example, the identification of func-
BMC Bioinformatics  2006, 7:56 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/56

tional pathways and studying the input (substrates)/out-
put (products) behavior of stoichiometric reaction
networks is facilitated by elementary-modes analysis[25,26]. Flux Balance Analysis is another related tech-nique often used for phenotype predictions of metabolicmutants [11,27]. Recently, the concept of minimal cut setshas been introduced for identifying targets in metabolic
networks [28,29]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to apply
these methods to signaling networks. However, some fun-damental differences in the way the network elementsinteract may complicate a direct transfer:
(1) The constraint-based framework assumes steady-state,
while in signaling networks a transient behavior can often
be observed. (However, as will be discussed below, manyuseful insights of signaling networks can be obtainedfrom using a static approach.)
(2) In stoichiometric networks, any arrow (reaction) lead-
ing from educts to products can be seen as an "activating"
(producing) connection for the products. Therefore,
employing stoichiometric framework it is difficult or onlyindirectly possible to express an inhibitory action of a spe-cies onto another.
(3) Probably the most significant difference is that the
edges (i.e. the connections between the species) in meta-
bolic networks carry flows of mass whereas edges in sign-
aling networks may carry mass and/or information
(signal) flow. Of course, at the molecular level, any inter-action between species in the cell can be written as a stoi-chiometric equation. However, whereas mass flow is
connected to a real consumption of participating com-
pounds, signal flow is usually characterized by a recyclingof certain species (e.g. enzymes) so that these species canmediate the signal transfer continuously (until they aredegraded).
A typical example, namely the activation of a receptor
tyrosine kinase (Figure 1(a)) [30], illustrates the simulta-neous occurrence of mass and signal flow. A ligand (Lig)binds to the extracellular domain of a receptor (Rec) yield-ing a receptor-ligand complex which can undergo furtherchanges (e.g. by autophosphorylation or/and dimeriza-tion). We denote the outcome by RecLig*. This complex is
now able to phosphorylate another molecule (M).
Accordingly, M binds to RecLig* and becomes phosphor-ylated (M-P) by the expense of ATP. At the end, M-P isreleased, recycling also the activated receptor-ligand com-plex RecLig*.
The first step in this scheme can be considered as a mass
flow. However, the cycle in which RecLig* phosphorylatesM, is a mass flow with respect to M and ATP, but a signal-ing flow with respect to RecLig*, as the latter is indeedrequired for driving this cycle but not consumed (because
recycled) in the overall stoichiometry.
In performing a structural analysis we are interested in
extracting signaling paths from the network scheme.Therefore, it may seem reasonable to compute elementarymodes, which typically represent pathways in reactionnetworks with mass flow [25]. A basic property of elemen-
tary modes is that the (relative) mass flow represented by
an elementary mode keeps the "internal" species in a bal-anced state. Internal species (here: RecLig*, RecLig*-M,RecLig*-M-P) are within the system's boundary, whereasthe external species (here: Rec, Lig, M, M-P, ADP, ATP) areconsidered as pools which are balanced by processes lying
outside the system's boundaries. Computing the elemen-
tary modes from the respective stoichiometric model ofFigure 1(a) gives exactly one mode which reflects the dis-cussed role of RecLig* as a kinase (Figure 1(b)): in its netstoichiometry, this elementary mode converts the externalspecies M and ATP into M-P and ADP, whereas RecLig* isrecycled. Since RecLig* is neither consumed nor produced
in the overall process, the first step (building the receptor-
ligand complex) is not involved in this mode simplybecause a continuous synthesis of RecLig* would lead toan accumulation of this species, which is inconsistentwith the steady-state assumption of elementary modes.Thus, the causal dependency of M-P from the availability
of Rec and Lig is not reflected by the mass flow concept of
elementary modes. Note that exactly the same conceptualproblem would arise when enzymes and enzyme synthe-(a) Example of a typical signaling pathway where mass and signal flow occur simultaneosly (Rec = receptor; Lig = ligand; RecLig* = (active) receptor-lig and-complex; M = molecule; M-P = phosphorylated molecule M)Figure 1

cled in the overall process.  Importantly, the mandatory
process of building the rece ptor-ligand-complex RecLig*
(hence, the causal dependeny of  M-P from the availability of
Rec and Lig) is not re flected by this mode.

sis would be considered explicitly in stoichiometric stud-
ies of metabolic networks.
The example demonstrates that we require a framework
with the ability to account for mass and signal flows. Han-
dling both mass and signal flows formally equivalent asinteractions could be a suitable approach. Interpreting Fig-
ure 1(a)) as a diagram of interactions we could redraw it
as depicted in Figure 2(a). The dashed arrow indicates thatRecLig* catalyzes the phosphorylation of M to M-P. If weassume that ADP, ATP, and M are always present, we getthe simple chain shown in Figure 2(b) expressing that Recand Lig are required to obtain RecLig* (or to activate
RecLig*), and that RecLig* is required to get M-P. If we do
not further distinguish between the two types of arrowsand thus consider mass and signal flows as formallyequivalent, the causal connections between the specieswould, nevertheless, still be captured correctly. Thisabstract representation of different types of interactionswill thus be used herein.
The following two sections will deal first with interaction
graphs and later with the more general (logical) interac-
tion hypergraphs . The basic difference between these two
related approaches can be illustrated by how they dealwith a connection such as "Rec + Lig" in Figure 2(b). If we
interpret it as "Rec activates RecLig* and Lig activates
RecLig*" then the concept of interaction graphs is applica-
ble (discussed in the following section). However, itwould be more accurate to say that "Rec AND Lig arerequired simultaneously for building RecLig*", and it is this
more refined approach that leads to the concept of inter-
action hypergraphs , which will be discussed in further
details later on.
Analyzing interaction graphs
Definition of interaction graphs
Interaction (or causal influence) graphs are frequently
used to show direct dependencies between species in sig-
naling, genetic, or protein-protein interaction networks.The nodes in these graphs may represent, depending onthe network type and the level of abstraction, receptors,ligands, effectors, kinases, genes, transcription factors,metabolites, proteins, and other compounds, while eachedge describes a relation between two of these species. In
signaling and gene regulatory networks, two further char-
acteristics are usually specified for each edge: a direction
(which species influences which) and a sign ("+" or "- ",
depending on whether the influence is activating (levelincreasing) or inhibiting (level decreasing)). Formally, werepresent a directed interaction or causal influence graph
as a signed directed graph G = (V, A), where V is the set of
vertices or nodes (species) and A the set of labeled
directed edges [31,32]. Directed edges are usually calledarcs and an arc from vertex i (tail) to j (head) is denoted by
an ordered tuple { i,j,s} with i, j ∈ V and s ∈ {+,- }.
Sometimes, for example in protein-protein interaction
networks, the directions of the edges remain unspecified.We will not consider such undirected interaction graphsexplicitly, however, many of the issues discussed in thefollowing can be transferred to undirected graphs (e.g. by
representing an undirected edge by two (forward and
backward) arcs).
The structure of a signed graph can be stored conveniently
by an m x q incidence matrix B in which the columns cor-
respond to the q arcs (interactions) and the rows to the m
nodes (species), similar as in stoichiometric matrices of
metabolic reaction networks [33]. For the k-th arc { i, j, s }
a (-1) is stored in the k-th column of B for the tail vertex
(i) and (+1) for the head vertex ( j) of arc k. Hence, B
i,k = -
1 and Bj,k = 1 and Bl,k = 0 (l≠ i, j). For storing the signs, a q-
vector s is introduced whose k-th element is (+1) if arc k is
positive and (-1) if k is negative.
Self-loops (arcs connecting a species with itself) are not
considered here but could be stored in a separate list sincethey would appear as a zero column in the incidencematrix.
Note that, as far as the memory requirement is concerned,
the structure of a graph can be stored more efficiently thanby an incidence matrix, e.g. by using adjacency lists [34].However, since we will present methods directly operat-ing on the incidence matrix, we refer herein to this repre-sentation.
Signal transduction networks are usually characterized by
an input, intermediate, and output layer (cf. [16]). Theinput domain consists only of species having no predeces-Interpretation of Figure 1 as an interaction network Figure 2

sor, which can thus not be activated from other species in
the graph. Such sources (typical representatives are recep-
tors and ligands) are starting points of signal transductionpathways and can easily be identified from the incidencematrix since their corresponding row contains no positiveentry. In contrast, the output layer consists only of nodeshaving no successor. These sinks , usually corresponding to
transcription factors or genes, are identifiable as rows in B
which have no negative entry. The set of source and sinknodes define the boundaries of the network under inves-tigation. They play here a similar role as the externalmetabolites in stoichiometric studies [33]. The intermedi-ate layer functions as the actual signal transduction and
processing unit. It consists of the intermediate species, all
of which have at least one predecessor and at least onesuccessor, i.e. they are influenced and they influence otherelements. Such species contain both -1 and +1 entries inthe incidence matrix. In reconstructed signaling networks,the detection of all sink and source species may help todetect gaps in the network, e.g. when a species should be
an intermediate but is classified as a sink or source.
The presence of sinks and sources are a consequence of
setting borders to the system of interest. Sometimes thereare no sinks or/and no sources, especially in models ofgene regulatory networks (see e.g. the networks studied in
[21]), but this does not impose limitations to the
approaches presented here.
A toy example of a (directed) interaction graph that will
serve for illustrations throughout this paper is given inFigure 3. This interaction graph, called TOYNET, consists
of two sources (I1, I2), two sinks (O1, O2), 7 intermediate
species (A,..., G), two inhibiting (arcs 2 and 7) and 11 acti-vating interactions. Incidence matrix B of TOYNET reads
(the sign vector s is given on the top of B):

Identification of feedback loops
Even though some analysis methods (e.g. Bayesian net-
works) rely on acyclic networks where feedbacks are notallowed, one of the most important features of signalingand regulatory networks are their feedback loops
[3,5,18,21,35-38]. Positive feedbacks are responsible and
even required [39] for multiple steady state behavior indynamical systems. In biological systems, multistationar-ity plays a central role in differentiation processes and forepigenetic and switch-like behavior. In contrast, negativefeedback loops are essential for homeostatic mechanisms
(i.e. for adjusting and maintaining levels of system varia-
bles) or for generating oscillatory behavior [35].
Most reports demonstrating the role and consequences of
feedback loops analyze relatively small networks wherethe cycles can be easily recognized from the network
scheme but rather few works address the question of how
feedback cycles can be identified systematically. This isparticularly important in large interaction graphs, where adetection by simple visual inspection is impossible, espe-cially when feedback loops overlap.
A feedback loop is, in graph theory, a directed cycle or cir-
cuit. A circuit is defined as a sequence C = {a
1,...,aw} of arcs
that starts and ends at the same vertex k and visits (with
the exception of k) no vertex twice, i.e. C = {a1,...,aw} =
{{k, l1}, {l1,l2},..., { lw-1,k}} such that all nodes k, l1, l2 ...
lw-1 are distinct. The parity of the number of negative signs
of the arcs in C determines whether the feedback loop is
negative (odd number of negative signs) or positive
(even). In the example TOYNET two feedback loops canbe found: (i) the arc sequence {4,5,6,7} which is negative(since one negative arc (7) is involved), and (ii) thesequence {10,11}, which is positive (because the signs ofboth arcs in this circuit are positive). Obviously, sinks and
sources (and all arcs connected to these nodes) can never
be involved in any circuit.B=+−+++ +−++++++

Computing all directed cycles in large graphs is computa-
tionally a difficult task. Algorithms that can be found in
the literature usually rely on backtracking strategies (e.g.[16,40]). Here, we introduce a different approach wherethe circuits are identified as elementary modes establish-ing a direct link to metabolic network analysis. Circuitscan be formally represented by a q-vector c in which c
i = 1
if arc i is involved in the circuit and ci = 0 otherwise. A cir-
cuit vector fulfills the equation
B c = 0 (2)
and hence, lies in the null space of the incidence matrix of
the graph [32,41]. Generally, any vector c obeying (2) ful-
fills a so-called conservation law and is called a circulation
which may be envisioned as a flow cycling around in thenetwork [42]. Eq. (2) is strongly related to the mass bal-ance equation of metabolic networks in steady state. Infact, considering the graph as a reaction network with thearcs being irreversible mono-molecular reactions, the inci-
dence matrix would be equivalent to the stoichiometric
matrix and any circulation would be equivalent to a sta-tionary flux distribution. Note that not all circulations arecircuits: the linear combinations of circuit vectors do alsoyield circulations but are not (elementary) circuits. Pre-cisely, circuits are special circulations having two addi-
tional properties. First, they must be admissible with
respect to the directions of the involved arcs, i.e. only non-negative values are allowed for c:
c
i≥ 0 for all i.  (3)
Second, circuits are non-decomposable circulations, i.e. the
set of arcs building up the circuit c, expressed by P( c) = {i:
ci > 0}, is irreducible:
There is no non-zero vector d fulfilling eqs. (2) and (3)
and P( d)⊂ P(c) (4)
Eqs. (2) and (3) and condition (4) close the complete
analogy to elementary modes. In fact, cycles or circuits arethe elementary modes in the special case of graphs (ele-mentary modes are defined for any matrix in eq. (2), not
only for the very special shape of incidence matricesrelated to graphs). Any feasible stationary flux vector in a
metabolic network can be obtained by non-negative lin-
ear combinations of elementary modes. Equivalently, anycirculation vector can be decomposed into a non-negativelinear combination of circuit vectors. Note that, multiply-ing a (circuit) vector c, that fulfills (2)-(4), by a scalar b>0
yields another vector v = bc which represents the same cir-
cuit because the same arcs compose it (are unequal to
zero). Moreover, all non-zero components in a circuit vec-tor are equal to each other. Therefore we can always nor-malize the vector in such a way that we obtain the binaryrepresentative of this circuit where all components are
either "1" or "0".
In metabolic networks, elementary modes reveal not only
internal cycles but also, even with higher relevance, meta-bolic pathways connecting input and output species. Con-tinuing with the analogy to interaction graphs, in the next
subsection we will see that elementary modes can be used
to identify not only feedback loops but also signalingpaths.
Signaling (influence) paths between two species
When the interaction graph is very large it becomes diffi-
cult to see whether a species S1 can influence (activate or
inhibit) another species S2 and via which distinct path-ways this can happen. Computing the complete set ofdirected paths between a given pair (S1, S2) of species istherefore often desirable. A path P = {a
1,...,aw} is, similarly
to a feedback circuit, a sequence of arcs where none of thenodes is visited more than once, but in the case of a sign-
aling path the start node S1 is distinct from the end node
S2, i.e. P = {a
1,...,aw} = {{ S1,l1}, {l1,l2}, ..., { lw-1,S2}} such
that all nodes S1, S2 , l1, l2 ... lw-1 are distinct.
To obtain the signaling pathways from S1 to S2 we pro-
ceed as follows (Figure 4(a)): we add an "input arc" for S1
(i.e. a new column in the incidence matrix B containing
only zeros except a (+1) for S1) and an "output arc" for S2(another new column in B containing only zeros except a
(-1) for S2. Then, computation of the elementary modesin this network will provide the original feedback loopswithout participation of the input and the output arc (as
shown above) and additionally all paths starting with the
input arc at S1 and ending with the output arc at S2, withthe latter revealing all possible routes between S1 and S2.

the intermediate layer.

Admittedly, the introduced input and output arcs have no
tail or no head, respectively, and would therefore not be
edges in the graph-theoretical sense, but this has no con-sequence for the analysis described within this contribu-tion. In fact, this procedure is equivalent to adding in theincidence matrix a "dummy" node representing the envi-ronment (ENV), an "input arc" from ENV to S1 and an
"output arc" from S2 to ENV (Figure 4(b)). Computing
the elementary modes from the resulting incidence matrixwould produce the feedback circuits as well as the circuitsrunning over ENV. The latter represent the paths leadingfrom S1 to S2. In the procedure described above ENV issimply removed from the incidence matrix leading to the
same results.
In order to obtain only the paths from S1 to S2 (without
the feedback loops), one can enforce the input and outputarc to be involved by using an extension of the algorithmfor computing elementary modes [43].
Furthermore, we may also add several input and output
edges simultaneously. For example, if we are interested inall the paths connecting the input layer with the outputlayer, i.e. all routes leading from a source to a sink node,we add to each source an input edge and to each sink anoutput edge and compute the elementary modes (and,
optionally, discard the feedback circuits where neither a
source nor a sink participates). In this way we obtain thesame set of signaling paths as if the elementary modeswould be computed separately for each possible pair ofsource and sink nodes. Figure 5 shows the complete set ofsignaling paths connecting the input with the output layer
of TOYNET.
Analogously to the feedback loops, we assign to each sig-
naling path an "overall sign" indicating whether A acti-vates (+) or inhibts (-) B along this path. Again, the parityof the signs of the arcs in the path determine whether the
influence is positive (even number of negative signs) or
negative (odd number of signs).
To sum up, feedback loops and influence paths in interac-
tion graphs can be identified as elementary modes (or,equivalently, as extreme rays of convex cones [44]) from
the respective incidence matrix. Similar conclusions have
recently been drawn by Xiong et al. [45], albeit the authorscomputed paths only between sink and source nodes andonly within unsigned graphs (i.e. they did not considerinhibitory effects). Feedback circuits were also not consid-ered. Hence, here we extend and generalize those results.
The equivalence of signaling paths and loops to elemen-
tary modes allows one the advantage to use the highlyoptimized algorithms for computing elementary modes[43,44,46].
Combinatorial studies on signaling paths
The computation of all paths between a pair of specieshelps us to recognize all the different ways in which a sig-nal can propagate between two nodes. In metabolic path-way analysis, a statistical or combinatorial analysis of theparticipation and co-occurrences of reactions in elemen-tary modes proved to be useful for obtaining system-wide
properties, such as the detection of essential reactions/
enzymes or correlated reaction sets (enzyme subsets)[11,26,47].
In principle, similar features are of interest also for signal-
ing paths and feedback loops. However, two important
issues arise in interaction graphs that require a special
treatment. First, we have two different types of pathways,positives and negatives. Owing to their opposite mean-ings we often need to analyze them separately in statisticalassessments. Second, in metabolic networks we are partic-ularly interested in the reactions (edges), because they cor-
respond to enzymes that are subject to regulatory
processes and can be knocked-out in experiments. In con-trast, in interaction graphs we are usually more interestedin the nodes, since they are often knocked-out in experi-ments or medical treatments, either via mutations, siRNAor by specific inhibitors. An edge in signaling networks
represents mostly a direct interaction between a pair of
species and has therefore no mediator. In some cases, anedge can directly be targeted by e.g. a mutation at the cor-responding binding site of one of the two nodes species

involved. Here, we will focus on species participation,
albeit similar computations can be made for the edges.
As mentioned several times, in signaling networks we are
often interested in all the different ways by which a certaintranscription factor (or any other species from the outputlayer) can be activated or inhibited by signals arriving theinput layer. For this purpose, we compute all signaling
paths leading from source nodes located in the input layer
down to a certain sink species s of interest. We denote the
set of all these paths by I
s, which can be dissected in the
two disjoint subsets of activating and inhibiting paths: I =
∫ . Each source species i can then be classified into
one of the following four influence classes with respect to
s:
(1) activator of s (i is involved in at least one path of
and in no path of )
(2) inhibitor of s (i is involved in at least one path of
and in no path of )
(3) ambivalent factor for s (i is involved in at least one
(inhibiting) path of  and in at least one (activating)
path of )
(4) without any influence on s (i is not involved in any
path of Is)
In TOYNET, we see from Figure 5 that I2 is a pure activator
and I1 an ambivalent factor for O1. With respect to O2, I1is an inhibitor and I2 again an activator. The qualitative
response of s after perturbing the level of a non-affecting
species, or of an inhibitor or activator can be predictedunambiguously (namely unchanged or decreasing orincreasing, respectively) as long as the network has nonegative feedback loop. Negative feedback loops limitsuch qualitative predictions for activators (or inhibitors):if there is any path from an activator (inhibitor) to s that
touches a negative feedback loop (i.e. at least one species
on the path is involved in a negative feedback) then theresulting effect in perturbation experiments can not bepredicted uniquely (cf. [36]). This case occurs in TOYNETfor I2 with respect to O1: I2 is an activator of O1 but theonly connecting path (P5 in Figure 5) goes through spe-
cies C which participates in the negative feedback circuit.
Thus, although at least a transient increase in O1 can beexpected after up-regulating I2, we cannot exclude that thenegative feedback drives the level of O1 below its initiallevel at a certain time point after increasing the level of I2.
We therefore call an activator (inhibitor) p of s a total acti-
vator (total inhibitor ) of s if there is no path from p to a spe-
cies in a negative feedback circuit that is in turn connectedto s.
Positive feedbacks do not limit these qualitative up/
down-predictions because they cannot change the mono-
tone effect of the respective input signal, e.g. whenincreasing the level of I2 in TOYNET we can expect anincrease in the level of O2 after some time.
To summarize, regarding the influence of a species p on
another species s we have 6 possible cases: total and non-
total activator, total and non-total inhibitor, ambivalentfactor and non-influencing species. Note that, by comput-ing the connecting signaling paths, this classification pro-cedure can be applied not only between a source and asink node but also between any pair of species, e.g.between a source and an intermediate, an intermediate
and a sink, and two intermediates. In TOYNET, for exam-
ple, F is a total activator of O2 and has no influence on
O1, whereas D is an inhibitor but not a total one of O1because it is connected to (even involved in) a negativefeedback circuit.
Additionally, as the complement of incoming paths, we
can also determine the paths starting in a certain species s
showing us which nodes and arcs are reachable from (andinfluenceable by) s. As a further generalization, sets of
incoming and/or outgoing paths can also be defined notonly for a single species s but also for a set S of species.
This might be useful, for example, when we are interested
in all paths ending (starting) in a certain subset of the sink(source) nodes.
Investigations of influence and signaling paths as pro-
posed above provide, apart from pair-pair relationships
(e.g. " a is a (total) activator of b" or "a has no influence on
b"), global properties (e.g. a is a (total) activator of all sink
species). Some other useful structural features and con-straints can be detected by a statistical or combinatorialanalysis of certain path sets (partially, similar ideas havebeen proposed by [14] for stoichiometric models of sign-aling networks):
 Essential species (arcs): When focussing on a specific sig-
naling event, e.g. the activation of a certain species by sig-nals from the input layer, we may identify essentialspecies (or arcs) with respect to this event. For example,species E and arc 9 are essential for activating O2 but non-
essential for the activating paths leading to O1 in

 Species (arc) participation: A more quantitative measure
can be obtained by giving percentages of all those activat-
ing and/or inhibiting pathways, in which the species orarc is involved. One may only relate the relative participa-tion to the paths where the respective species or arc isinvolved or to the complete set of paths. For example, I2is involved in 50% of all positive paths coming from the
input layer and activating O1, while I2 is involved in
100% of all paths activating O2 (but only 50% of thepaths coming from I2 lead to O2). Arc 9 is involved in oneactivating and one inhibiting path leading to O2. Thus,only 50% of the paths running over this arc are activating,however, it is involved in all (100%) activating paths con-
necting sources with O2. Similar considerations can be
done regarding feedback loops: in TOYNET, species D andA as well as arcs 6, 7 and 11 are not involved in paths con-necting input with output layers and have thus a specialimportance in establishing the negative (D, A, arcs 6 and7) and positive (arc 11) feedback. (Note that a similarmeasure for the importance of a species or arc is between-
ness centrality [48]. This importance measure is well-
known in graph theory and checks how many shortest
paths between pairs of nodes are running over the respec-tive node or arc.)
 Redundancy: The total number of paths activating
(inhibiting) a species is a measure for the redundancy in
the system.
 Path length: The length distribution of signaling paths
provides a rough idea on the compactness of the network[18].
 Crosstalk: Using our framework, crosstalk might be
defined as a place (node) where paths from differentsource nodes cross each other for the first time. For exam-ple, E is a crosstalk species in TOYNET (signals of I1 andI2 cross) whereas F and G are not. In some cases, however,
crosstalk is a more complex phenomenon where different
nodes are involved. For example, at species C a path com-ing from I1 via B and another path from I2 via E meet eachother. However, I1 and I2 have also met earlier in E and,additionally, the action of I1 on C via B is already influ-enced by I2 in species B since I2 can act on B via the pathvisiting E, C, D and A.
Distance matrix and dependency matrix
Some applications presented in this section requireexhaustive enumerations of signaling paths becomingcomputationally challenging in large networks. However,in some cases we only want to know whether any activat-
ing and/or any inhibiting path between two nodes exists
or whether there is any positive or any negative feedbackcircuit in which a certain species is involved. For such"existence questions" we can often apply standard meth-ods from graph theory. A very useful object is the distance
matrix D which can be obtained with low computational
demand by computing the shortest distances (shortestpath lengths) between each pair of species (e.g. Dijkstra'salgorithm [32]). D has dimension m × m and the element
D
ij stores the length of the shortest path for traveling from
node i to node j, being Dij = ∞ if no paths exists between i
and j. The distance matrix shows immediately
 which elements can be influenced by species i (the i-th
row of D)
 which nodes can influence species i (i-th column of D)
 whether feedback circuits exist: if the distance Dii from a
node i back to itself is finite, then i is involved in at least
one feedback loop. Furthermore, if Dij and the transposed
element Dji are finite, Dij, Dji≠∞, then a feedback between
species i and j exists.
By an extension of the usual shortest path algorithm (not
shown), we may also compute separately a matrix Dpos for
the shortest positive paths and another Dneg for the shortest
negative paths. Table 1 shows the distance matrices Dpos
and Dneg from TOYNET.
Note that by taking the minimum values from Dpos and
Dneg, D can be obtained. Moreover, the two matrices Dpos
and Dneg, whose computation is reasonably possible in
very large networks, are sufficient to classify all species
into (total/non-total) activators, (total/non-total) inhibi-tors, ambivalent factors, and non-influencing nodes withrespect to a certain compound y. The reason is that this
classification requires only knowledge on the existence of
positive and negative paths between species pairs and on
the existence of negative feedback loops. For example, a
species x is a total activator of y if (i) at least one positive
path from x to y exits (  ≠ ∞) and if (ii) no negative
path from x to y exists (  = ∞) and if (iii) for any spe-
cies z that is influenced by x (D
x, z ≠ ∞) and connected to y
(Dz, y ≠ ∞) it holds, that z is not involved in a negative feed-
back (  = ∞).
For representing species dependencies in a compact man-
ner, we introduce the dependency matrix M, which shows
all the pair-wise dependencies, e.g. by using 6 differentcolors (for the 6 possible cases). Thereby, the color ofmatrix element M
xy indicates whether species x is a total/
non-total activator or a total/non-total inhibitor or an
ambivalent factor or a non-influencing node for species y.Dxypos

Again, x = y is allowed, indicating feedbacks. Figure 6
shows the dependency matrix for TOYNET.
Although the distance and dependency matrices store a
wealth of structural information in a very condensedmanner, some applications still require a full enumera-tion of all available signaling paths. One case is the sys-tematic determination of minimal cut sets.Minimal cut and intervention sets in interaction graphs
Searching for intervention strategies in signaling networksis of high relevance in experimental and, in particular,
medical applications. Recently, the concept of minimal cut
sets has been introduced, which facilitates the identifica-
tion of efficient intervention strategies (cuts) and, at thesame time, the recognition of potential failure modes in agiven biochemical reaction network [28,29]. Basically, inthe most general version, a minimal cut set (MCS) is
defined as a minimal (irreducible, non-decomposable)
set of cuts (or failures) of edges or/and nodes thatrepresses a certain functionality or behavior in the system[29]. For example, assume we want to prevent the activa-tion of the sink node O1 in TOYNET. By removing nodes{B, E} one can be sure that an activation of O1 by an
external stimulus becomes infeasible. The set {B, E}
would thus be a cut set for preventing the activation ofO1. Moreover, it is minimal since neither the removal ofonly B nor the removal of only E can guarantee that the"inhibition task" is achieved. Another minimal cut setwould be {C}. C is thus essential for activating O1, as
would be confirmed by participation analysis of all paths
activating O1. A general algorithmic scheme for a system-atic enumeration of MCSs in stoichiometric networks wasgiven in [29]:
(i) Define a deletion task
(ii) Compute all minimal functional units (elementary
modes) and specify the set of target modes that have to be
attacked in order to achieve the deletion task
(iii) Compute the so-called minimal hitting sets of the tar-
get modes
We could proceed here in a similar way. First, a deletion
task specifying the goal of our intervention is defined. Inour example, the deletion task is "Prevent the activation ofDependency matrix of TOYNETFigure 6

O1 by any external input". Hence, the signaling paths
from the input layer to O1 are computed, which are P1,
P2, and P5 (see Figure 5). However, according to our dele-tion task, the target set comprises only the paths P1 andP5, because only these two activate O1. Finally, the mini-mal hitting sets of the target paths have to be computed,which are the MCSs [26,29]. When cutting species, a hit-
ting set T is a set of species that "hits" all target paths in a
minimal way, i.e. for each target path there is at least onespecies that is contained in T and in the path. To be a min-
imal hitting set, no proper subset of T fulfills the hitting set
condition. The minimal hitting sets of the target paths andhence the MCSs of our deletion task would be: {C}, {B,
E}, {I2, B}, {I1, E} and {I1, I2}. Deletion tasks may be
more complicated: for example, in TOYNET we might beinterested to repress the activation of O1 and O2. Accord-
ingly, the target paths would increase by one (P4 in Figure5) resulting in another set of MCSs.
This example might suggest that we can use the same pro-
cedure as in metabolic networks, namely computing the
minimal hitting sets with respect to the target paths. Thisnaive approach works indeed for the case where the targetpaths do only involve positive arcs (as in our example). Itcan also be applied for interrupting any set of feedback cir-cuits. For example, removing {A} interrupts the negative
feedback circuit and deleting {D, F} interrupts both feed-
back circuits in TOYNET. However, in general, negativelysigned arcs occurring in interaction graphs require a spe-cial treatment. Even the following simple activating pathleading from a source species I to a sink species O containspitfalls:
. If the activation of O
is to be repressed, the signal flow along this path must be
interrupted. Removal of one species in the chain shouldbe sufficient. However, not all nodes are allowed to be cut.If species B is removed, its negative action on C would beinterrupted, enabling in turn C to activate O. The reasonis that B, according to the definitions, is an inhibitor of O
and is therefore not a proper cut candidate. In fact, we
could add (constitutively provide or activate) B to stop an
activation of O. Generally, for attacking an activating path,
only the species that have an activating effect on the endnode of this path are proper cut candidates, whereas spe-cies inhibiting the end node should instead be kept at ahigh level to prevent an activation along this path. Hence,as a generalization of (minimal) cut sets, we define (min-
imal) intervention sets (MISs) in interaction networks as
(minimal) sets of elements that are to be removed or to be
added in order to achieve a certain intervention task . Byallowing only the removal of elements, the set of MISs
coincides with the MCSs.
The computation of the MISs (or the smaller set of MCSs)
for a set of activating target paths that involve negatively
signed arcs is a more difficult task than computing onlyminimal hitting sets. Indeed, each MIS will still representa hitting set, because at least one species in each targetpath must be removed or constitutively provided. The dif-ficulty arises by ambivalent factors which have in some
target paths an activating and in others an inhibitory effect
upon the end node. We could therefore restrict the inter-ventions to those species that are either pure activatorswith respect to the target paths (these are allowed to beremoved) or pure inhibitors (these are allowed to beadded). Using only these species, the MISs could again becomputed as the minimal hitting sets.
However, for computing MISs that may also act on ambiv-
alent factors, we present a more general algorithm (herefor a given set of activating target paths):
(1) In each target path, the involved nodes are labeled by
+1 (if the species influences the end node of the respective
path positively) or by -1 (if the species has a negative influ-
ence on the end node of the respective path ).
(2) Combinations C
i of one, two, three, ... distinct
removed or activated species are constructed systemati-
cally. For each combination Ci, it is checked for each target
path whether the signal flow from the start node to theend node is interrupted properly. A requirement is that atleast one of the positive (+1) species of each path isremoved or at least one negative (-1) species is provided(added) by C
i (hitting set property). If, for a certain path,
Ci contains several nodes that are visited by this paths then
it is only checked whether the node closest to the end
node is attacked properly. When all paths have beenattacked (hit) properly by a combination C
i, then a new
MIS has been found. When constructing further combina-tions of larger cardinality, the algorithm has to ensure thatnone of the new combinations contains an earlier found
MISs completely.
Of course, this enumerative algorithm is even more time
consuming than computing minimal hitting sets and itwill become infeasible to compute all MISs in large net-works. We may then restrict ourselves to MISs of low car-
dinality and/or to the subset of MCSs. Besides, the
determination of MISs can become even more compli-cated: it might happen that a MIS attacks all activating tar-get paths correctly but simultaneously destroys aninhibiting path (not contained in the set of target paths)which might then become an activating path. The MCS{I1, I2} of our example represents such a problematicIABCO+− −+→ →  →  → 

case: it hits the two activating paths to O1 as demanded,
but it also attacks the inhibiting path leading from I1 to
O1. Thus, the inhibition of E through I1 would be inter-rupted and it could be sufficient to retain E in an activestate enabling the activation of O1. Hence, we would notbe sure about the activation status of O1 after removingthis cut set. To avoid such side-effects, we may extend our
algorithm given above by checking also the consequence
of each intervention C
i with respect to the non-target
paths and exclude combinations that do not fulfill certaincriteria.
In a completely analogous fashion, we can also determine
MCSs or MISs that repress inhibitory paths. For example,
removing {I1} is a MCS that attacks the only inhibitingpath to O1, alternatively we might use the MISs {#E} or{#C}, where # stands for "constitutively provided". Thesame issues as discussed above must be taken into accountwhen interrupting a negative path: here, in each targetpath, only the inhibiting species of the final sink source
should be removed whereas the activating nodes can be
added. Furthermore, we may also define more compli-cated intervention tasks, e.g. where some activating andsome inhibiting paths are selected as target paths.
Jacobian matrix and interaction graph
Several works have highlighted the strong relationshipsbetween interaction graphs and the Jacobian matrix J, the
latter obtained from a dynamical model of the networkunder investigation [10,35,39]. A dynamic model of a sig-naling (or any kind of interaction) network is usuallydescribed by a system of ordinary differential equations
that model the evolution of the m network components x
1
... xmwith the time:
The m × m Jacobian matrix J(x) collects the partial deriva-
tives of F with respect to x:

The sign of Jik(x) tells whether xk has a (direct) positive or
negative influence on xi and sign( J(x)) can thus be seen as
the adjacency matrix of the underlying interaction graph.
In an adjacency matrix Y, a non-zero entry for Yik indicates
an edge from node i to k. Adjacency and incidence matrix
are equivalent for describing a graph structure and can beconverted into each other: each non-zero element Yik gets
a corresponding column in the incidence matrix.
The sign structure of the Jacobian matrix is, in biological
systems, typically constant and reflects, despite its veryqualitative nature, fundamental properties of the dynamicsystem. For example, multistationarity can only occur if a
positive circuit exists in the associated interaction graph
[39]. Methods for the detection of multistability in a spe-cial class of dynamical systems – monotone I/O systems –have been developed by Sontag et al. [36]. Monotone I/Osystems possess a monotonicity property that can bechecked from the interaction graph spanned by the Jaco-
bian matrix. In fact, having one source species and one
sink species, the required monotonicity property is equiv-alent to our definition of a total activator of the sink node.
Thus, the methods developed in the previous section maysupport such studies, where the structure of the Jacobianmatrix is analyzed. Having the absolute values of the Jaco-bian matrix available (which change over time), arcs,
paths, and feedback circuits could be assigned an interac-
tion strength useful to identify key elements in the net-work.
Boolean networks and (logic al) interaction hypergraphs
Definitions
The methods described above consider an interaction as a
dependency between two species allowing to employtools from graph theory. However, in cellular networks,an interaction (edge) often represents a relationshipamong more than two species (nodes). A typical exampleis a bimolecular reaction of the form A+B → C, where three
species are involved. The binding of the ligand to the
receptor in Figure 2(b) (Rec+Lig → RecLig*) is such a
bimolecular interaction. Using an interaction graph, thisreaction is modeled with two arcs (Figure 7(a)), namelyRec→ RecLig* and Lig → RecLig*, capturing correctly that
Rec and Lig have an influence on RecLig*. However, this
relaxed representation has shortcomings for a functional
interpretation of the network. To exemplify this, considerthe minimal cut sets repressing the phosphorylation of Min Figure 7(a). As explained in the previous section, weneed to attack all positive paths leading to M-P. There aretwo positive paths, one starting from Rec and the otherfrom Lig and, thus, {Rec, Lig} would be a minimal cut set.
But, intuitively, this cut set is not minimal for the real sys-
tem because both Rec and Lig are required for activatingM, and removing only one of the two species is thus suffi-cient to interrupt the activation of M. (In other words, theexistence of a signaling path in an interaction graph doesnot ensure that a signal can flow along this path.)
This example reveals that a proper consideration of AND-
connections between species is required. However, AND-relationships are not possible in graphs but in hyper-

graphs, which are generalizations of graphs. Similar to a
directed graph, a directed hypergraph H=(V, A) consists of
a set V of nodes and a set A of hyperarcs (= directed hyper-
edges [49]). A hyperarc aconnects two subsets of nodes: a
= {S,E}; S,E⊂ V. S comprises the tail (start) nodes and E
the head (end) nodes of the connection. S and E can have
arbitrary cardinality, and a graph is a special case of ahypergraph where the cardinality of S and E is 1 for all
edges.
In our context, without loss of generality, we will usually
have only one end node in E and we interpret a hyperarc
as an interaction in which the compound contained in E
is activated by a combined action of the species containedin S. Figure 7(b) depicts the example with the receptor-lig-
and-complex as a hypergraph in which a hyperarc cap-
tures now the AND-connection between Rec and Ligyielding RecLig*.
AND connections facilitate a refined representation of sto-
ichiometric conversions within interaction networks,albeit the precise stoichiometric coefficients are not cap-
tured here. Apart from stoichiometric interactions, AND
connections allow the description of other dependencies,for example, the case where only the presence of an acti-vator AND the absence of an inhibitor leads to the activa-tion of a certain protein.
In TOYNET, the four nodes (B, C, E, F) have more than
one incoming arc (Figure 3). In these nodes it is undeter-mined how the different stimuli are combined, e.g.whether B AND E are required to activate C or whether
one of both is sufficient (B OR E).
We could therefore concatenate all incoming edges in a
node by logical operations leading to Boolean networks
[21,31]. An assumption underlying Boolean networks isto consider only discrete (concentration/activation) levels
for each species; in the simplest case a species can only be
"off" (= 0 = "inactive" or "absent") and "on" (= 1 ="active" or "present"). Hence, each species is consideredas a binary (logical) variable. Next, a Boolean function f
i
is defined for each node i which determines under which
conditions i is on or off, respectively. fi depends only on
those nodes in the interaction graph from which an arc
points into species i. In general, for constructing a Boolean
function, all logical operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR,NAND can be used. However, here we express eachBoolean function by a special representation known assum of products (SOP; also called (minimal) disjunctivenormal form (DNF)) which is possible for any Boolean
function [50]. SOP representations require only AND, OR
and NOT operators. In a SOP expression, literals , which
are Boolean variables or negated Boolean variables, areconnected by AND's giving clauses . Several such AND
clauses are then in turn connected by OR's. Using theusual symbols '·' for AND, '+' for OR and '!' for NOT, an
example of a SOP expression would be: f
i = x·y·z + x·!z
stating that fi gets value "1" if ( x AND y AND z are active)
OR (if x is active AND z is NOT) and "0" else. The SOP
expression fi = x·!y + !x·y mimics an XOR gate.
In our context, writing a Boolean function as a SOP has
several advantages. First, many biological mechanisms
that lead to the activation of a species correspond directlyto SOP representations. Second, by using SOPs, the struc-ture of a Boolean network can be represented anddepicted intuitively as a hypergraph: each hyperarc point-ing into a node i is an AND clause of other nodes and rep-
resents one way of activating i; hence, all hyperarcs ending
in i are OR'ed together. A hyperarc carries a signal flow to
its end node and the binary value of the flow depends onthe state of all its start nodes. In the following, such ahypergraph induced by a minimal SOP representation ofa Boolean network will be called a logical interaction hyper-
graph (LIH ).
In Figure 8 a possible instance of a LIH compatible with
the interaction graph of TOYNET in Figure 3 is depicted.In each of the four nodes with more than one incomingarc, the logical concatenation has now been specified. Forexample, B is now activated if A AND I1 are active simul-
taneously (hyperarc "1&4"). In contrast, C is activated if B
OR E is present (active), and F is active if E OR G are in anactive state. Hence, C and F retain their graph-like struc-ture.(a) the graphical and (b) th e more correct hypergraphical representation of the simple interaction network shown in Figure 1 and 2Figure 7

representation of the simple interaction network shown in

Inhibiting arcs in the interaction graph are interpreted in
the corresponding LIH as NOT-operations. Thus, arc 7 is
now interpreted as "A is active if D is not present". Sincearc 2 and 3 in Figure 3 have been combined with an ANDin Figure 8, we interpret this new hyperarc as "E becomesactivated if I2 is present AND I1 NOT". Hence, in contrastto inhibiting arcs in interaction graphs, in general we do
not assign a minus sign (a NOT) to the complete hyperarc,
but to its negative branches (see hyperarc 2&3 in Figure8), whereas all other branches get positive signs. Due tothe assignment of signs LIHs can formally be seen assigned directed hypergraphs .
The pure logical description of a signaling or regulatory
network works well when the activation (inhibition) of aspecies by others follows a sigmoid curve [21]. Problemsthat might arise while describing a real network within thelogical framework and possible solutions are discussed ina later section.
LIHs can be formally represented and stored in a similar
way as interaction graphs. The underlying hypergraph isstored by an m × n incidence matrix B in which the rows
correspond to the species and the columns to the n hyper-
arcs. If species i is contained in the set of start (tail) nodes
of a hyperarc k then B
ik = -1, if i is the endpoint (head) of
hyperarc k then Bik = 1, and if i is not involved in k we have
Bik = 0. For storing the NOTs operating on certain species
in a hyperarc we may use another m × n matrix U that
stores in Uik a "1" if species i enters the hyperarc k with its
negated value and "0" else. Accordingly, the incidencematrix B for the LIH of TOYNET (Figure 8) reads
To be concise, the two non-zeros entries of U are indicated
by an asterisk in the incidence matrix.
Representing a Boolean network as a LIH we can easily
reconstruct the underlying interaction graph from thematrices B and U: we simply split up the hyperarcs having
more than one start node (or/and more than one endnode in the general case). Thus, a hyperarc with d start and
g end nodes is converted into d·g arcs in the interaction
graph. The sign of each arc in the graph model can beobtained from U. The reverse, the reconstruction of the
LIH from the interaction graph, is not possible in a uniquemanner underlining the non-deterministic nature ofinteraction graphs.
Time in Boolean networks
A logical interaction hypergraph describes only the static
structure of a Boolean network. However, it is the dynamic
behavior of Boolean networks that has been analyzedintensely in the context of biological (especially genetic)
systems [21,31,51]. For studying the evolution of a logical
system we need to introduce the (discrete) time variable t
and a state vector x(t) that captures the logical values of
the m species at time point t. Two fundamental strategies
exist to derive the new state vector x(t+1) from the current
state x(t). In the synchronous model, the logical value of
each node i is updated by evaluating its Boolean function
f
i with the current state vector: xi (t+1) = fi(x(t)). Synchro-
nous models are deterministic but assume for all interac-tions the same time delay which is often too unrealistic forbiological systems [21]. In the asynchronous model, we
select any (but only one) node i whose current state is
unequal to its associated Boolean function: x
i (t) ≠ fi(x(t)).
Only this node switches in the next iteration. Since there
are, in general, degrees of freedom in choosing the switch-ing node, this description is non-deterministic. Theadvantage is that the complete spectrum of potential tra-jectories is captured, albeit the graph of sequences is usu-ally very dense, complicating its analysis in large systems.
The asynchronous description becomes (more) determin-
istic if time delays for activation and inhibition events areknown [21].B=−−

We are now approaching the main part of this section.
Logical steady-state analysis
An important characteristic of the dynamic behavior of
Boolean networks, which is equivalent for both asynchro-nous and synchronous descriptions, is the set of logical
steady states (LSSs) . LSSs are state vectors x
s obeying  =
fi(xs) for all nodes i. Hence, in LSS, the state of each node
is consistent with the value of its associated Boolean func-
tion and, therefore, once a Boolean network has movedinto a logical steady state, it will stop to switch and then
retain this state.
In the following, we will focus on logical steady state anal-
ysis (thus circumventing any interpretation problems that
might arise by choosing synchronous or asynchronousdescription), which suffices for a number of applications,especially for predicting potential functional states in sig-naling or regulatory networks.
Given a Boolean network we may enumerate all possible
LSSs [52]. However, this is computationally difficult in
large networks. Besides, we are often interested in particu-lar LSSs that can be reached from a given initial state x
0. In
some cases, we only know a fraction of all initial node val-ues. For example, a typical scenario in signaling networkswould be that initial values from species in the input layer
are known (specifying which external signals reach the
cell and which not), and we would like to know how the(logical) integration and propagation of these input sig-nals generate a certain logical pattern in the output layer.Of course, we have to "wait" until the signals reach thebottom of the network and, for obtaining a unique
answer, there should be a time point from which the states
will not change in the future. This is equivalent to deter-mining the LSS in which the network will run from a givenstarting point.
In a possible scenario for TOYNET, the initial values of the
source species I1 and I2 might be known to be  = 0 and
= 1, whereas the initial states of all other nodes are
unknown (Figure 9(a)). The states of I1 and I2 will not
change anymore because I1 and I2 have no predecessor in
the hypergraph model. Assuming that each interactionhas a finite time delay, E must become active and B inac-tive. From these fixed values we can conclude that C andF will definitely become active (by E) at a certain timepoint and not change this state in the future. Proceedingfurther in the same way, we can resolve the complete LSSresulting from the given initial values of I1 and I2 (Figure9(b)).The last example illustrated that partial knowledge on ini-
tial values, especially from the source nodes, can be suffi-cient to determine the resulting LSS uniquely. However, ingeneral, several LSSs might result from a given set of initialvalues or a LSS may not exist at all. For example, if we only
know  = 1 in TOYNET nothing can be concluded
regarding a LSS (except that I2 will retain its state). If no
complete LSS can be concluded uniquely from initial val-ues, there might nevertheless be a subset of nodes that willreach a state in which they will remain for the future. For
example, setting  = 1 E will definitely become inacti-
vated after some time (again, finite time delay is
assumed). Since in this scenario nothing further can bederived for other nodes, we would say that x
I1 = 1 and xE =
0 are partial LSSs for the initial value set {  = 1}. Note
that these two partial steady states would not change
when we specified more or even all initial values.
We have conceived an algorithm which derives partial
LSSs that follow from a given set of initial values (if foreach node a partial LSS can be found, then a unique and
complete LSS exists for the set of initial values). The itera-
tive algorithm uses the following rules in the logicalhypergraph model:
 initial values of source nodes will not change in the
future, hence, are partial LSSs
 if species i has a proved partial LSS of 0, all hyperarcs in
which i is involved with its non-negated value have a zero
flow
 if species i has a proved partial LSS of 1, all hyperarcs in
which i is involved with its negated value have a zero flowxis

 if all hyperarcs pointing into node i have a zero flow,
then i has a partial LSS of 0
 if all start nodes of a hyperarc have a partial LSS of 1 (or
of 0 for those start nodes entering the hyperarc with thenegated value) then a partial LSS of 1 follows for the endnode of this hyperarc
 knowing all the positive feedback circuits in the system,
we can check whether there is a "self-sustaining" positivecircuit where the known initial state values of the involvednodes guarantee a partial LSS for all the nodes in this cycle(see comments below)
In each loop, the algorithm tries to identify new partial
LSSs (following from the current set of partial LSSs alreadyidentified) until no further ones can be found. Setting ini-tial values in the input layer, this can be envisioned as apropagation of signals through the interaction networkuntil signals reach nodes where the available information
is not sufficient to derive a unique LSSs.
Generally, in logical interaction hypergraphs where the
underlying interaction graph has no feedback loop (i.e. isacyclic), specification of the initial values of all the sourcenodes will always result in a unique and complete LSSsince the signals can be propagated step by step from top-
down to the output layer. In general, if all initial values are
known for the input layer, non-uniqueness or even non-existence of partial LSSs can only be generated by feedbackloops. The partial LSSs of nodes involved in positive feed-backs do often depend on the initial values of all the
nodes in this loop. For example, defining  = 0 we can
conclude a partial LSSs of zero for E in TOYNET (Figure
8), but, among others, the values of F, G and O2 remain
unknown although the only connection to a source nodeleads via E. The reason is that F and G build up a positivefeedback loop which cannot be resolved without knowl-edge on further initial values. If we know, additionally to
= 0, that  = 1 then F and G will always keep
each other activated so that we can infer a partial LSS of 1
for F, G and O2 (this is the last rule in the list given
above). If we have instead  = 0, we derive a 0 for
the partial LSS of these three nodes. If one of the two
nodes F and G has an initial value of 1 and the other 0,nothing can be derived since the positive loop might
become fully activated or fully deactivated. However,
what can be confirmed in these simple examples is thatpositive feedback loops induce multistationarity. It isnoteworthy that continuous dynamic models of networkswith positive feedbacks will depend, apart from kinetic
parameters, in a similar fashion on initial state values.
In contrast, negative feedback loops are not sensitive
against initial values but they can be the source of oscilla-tions, preventing hence the existence of LSSs. In TOYNETwe have one negative feedback loop which can potentially
generate oscillations, for example, when we set  = 1.
Then, C cannot be activated via E. Assuming an initial
value of 0 for C (the same conclusion would be drawn
with 1), D becomes deactivated and thus A actived. Due
to the partial LSS of 1 for I1 we get an activation of B andthen of C and D which in turn inhibits A leading in thenext round to a deactivation of B, C and D and so on. Thelogical states within this circuit and downstream of it(O1) will thus never reach a steady state. As shown in[21], oscillatory behavior in logical models correspondsto oscillations or a stable equilibrium (lying somehow
between the fully activated and fully inactivated level) in
the associated continuous model, depending on the cho-sen parameters. Negative feedback loops can thus impedepredictions on the basis of logical steady states, but theyalso point to network structures whose parametrizationwill have great impact on the dynamic behavior.
Note that feedback loops do not always prevent predic-
tions on (partial) LSSs as can be seen by the example inFigure 9, it depends on the given initial values.
Such a logical steady state or "signal flow" analysis (SFA)
as presented herein shares similarities with the established
method of metabolic flux analysis [53]. In MFA, uptakeand excretion rates of cells are measured in order to recon-struct the intracellular flux distribution within a metabolicnetwork. MFA relies on the quasi-steady state assumption,similarly as SFA relies on LSS. However, whereas MFA tries
to reconstruct the reaction rates along the edges and noth-
ing can be said on the states of the species, the goal of SFAis to determine the steady states of the nodes (belongingto a given activation scheme) from which then the signalflows along the edges follow. It is noteworthy that the cal-culability of unknown reaction rates in MFA depends onlyon the set of known rates [54], whereas in SFA the set of
given initial states and their respective values determine the
unique calculability of (partial) LSSs.

Input-output behavior
Imposing different patterns of signals in the input layer
one may check which species become activated or inhib-ited in the intermediate and, in particular, in the outputlayer. This can also be simulated in combination with dif-ferent initial state values for certain intermediate nodes,albeit this will have an influence on the LSS only in con-
nection with positive feedbacks, as shown above.
Mutants and interventions
The changes in signals flows and in the input-output
behavior occurring in a manipulated or malfunctioningnetwork can be studied by removing or adding elements
or by fixing the states of certain species in the network. In
TOYNET, for example, if we want to study the effect of amutant missing F (or the effect of adding an inhibitor forF) we may remove species F from the network (or, equiv-alently, fix the state of F to zero) and compute then thepartial LSSs again. We will see that, independently of agiven pattern in the input layer, G and O1 will be assigned
a partial LSS of 0. Removing elements often changes not
only the values , but also the determinacy of partial LSSs.
Minimal cut sets (MCSs) and minimal intervention sets (MISs)
The definiton of MCSs and MISs in logical interaction
hypergraphs is similar as in interaction graphs: a MCS is a
minimal (irreducible) set of species whose removal will
prevent a certain response or functionality as defined byan intervention goal. In the more general MISs we permit,additionally to cuts, also the constitutive activation of cer-
tain compounds. Two examples in TOYNET: removing Fis a MCS for repressing an activation of G and O2. Assum-
ing an initial state of zero for the species in the intermedi-
ate layer, adding I1 and removing B would be a properMIS for repressing the activation of O1 and O2. Note thatin the interaction graph of TOYNET, this interventionwould not suffice to attack all activating paths leadingfrom the input layer to O1 and O2 (path P4 not attacked,
Figure 5). This example underscores again that MCSs and
MISs in interaction hypergraphs are usually smaller thanthose obtained from the underlying interaction graph,simply because more constraints are added by logicalcombinations. However, the determination of MCSs, andlet alone MISs, in logical interaction hypergraphs is com-binatorially complicated as in interaction graphs, in par-
ticular when negative signs (NOTs) occur. Here, we can
only propose a "brute-force" approach where the LSSanalysis serves algorithmically as an oracle: we check sys-tematically for each combination of one, two, three ...knocked out (for MISs also of permanently activated)nodes in the network how this affects the (partial) LSSs,
possibly in combination with a given scenario of initial
states. From the resulting partial LSSs we can decidewhether our intervention goal has been achieved or not.To compute only minimal cut or intervention sets, furthercombinations with a cut or intervention set already satis-
fying our intervention goal have to be avoided. The algo-
rithm can be stopped when a user-given maximumcardinality for the MCSs/MISs has been reached.
Backward propagation
The methods described above compute partial LSSs actu-
ally only by forward propagation of signals, but one may
also do the opposite, e.g. fixing values in the output layerand tracing back the required states of nodes in the inter-mediate and input layer using similar rules as for forwardpropagation.
Network expansion methods
There is an interesting relationship between our LSS anal-ysis and network expansion methods proposed by Eben-höh et al. [55]. Network expansion allows for checkingwhich metabolites can in principle be produced from aprovided set of start species within a metabolic (stoichio-metric) reaction network. This is a special case in our log-
ical framework. Briefly, metabolic networks are per se
hypergraphs and can thus be represented as a LIH by usingonly AND's (each reaction is an AND clause of its reac-tants; stoichiometric coefficients are not considered) andOR's. Hence, no inhibiting interactions exist. We maythen put the supplied set of available species in the input
layer, set the initial values of all other species to zero and
compute then the LSS. Note that, according to the expla-nations given above, a complete LSS will always be foundsince all initial values are given and no negative feedbackcircuit exists. Therefore, the computed LSS indicateswhich species can be produced from the input set and
which not.
Extensions for the logical description of interaction networks
Several extensions and refinements of the logical frame-
work can be introduced which allow a more appropriatedescription of real signaling and regulatory networks:
(1) As already proposed and applied by Thomas et al.
[21], the discretization in more than two levels is in prin-ciple possible. This mimics the fact, that in reality multi-ple relevant threshold values for a species may exist. Arefined discretization could be relevant, for instance, for aspecies that activates/inhibits more than one species (with
different threshold levels). Another relevant situation
occurs if a species can be activated via two paths (con-nected by an OR; see species C in TOYNET): the activationvia both paths might be significantly stronger than by only
one. However, considering several activation levels for a
certain species forces one to often consider multiple levels
for elements downstream or/and upstream of this species,
increasing hence the complexity of the network, andrequiring detailed knowledge which is often not available.
BMC Bioinformatics  2006, 7:56 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/56

(2) As we have seen, negative feedback can limit the pre-
dictability in LSS analysis. However, in cellular networks,
negative feedbacks become activated often upon a certaintime period after an activation event occurs, for example,when gene expression is involved. This might be consid-ered by classifying species and/or hyperedges by assigninga discrete time constant (or time scale) τ to each element
telling us whether this network element appears in an
early (τ = 1) or late ( τ = 2) state. Using the sub-network
with all elements having a time constant of τ = 1 for the
first simulation and then using the computed LSSs as ini-tial values for computing the second round (where thecomplete network is considered) leads often to more real-
istic results. As in the case of multiple levels, this extension
requires a more detailed knowledge about the networkunder consideration. An example in TOYNET (Figure 8):we may assume that D is a factor that is transcriptionallyregulated by C, thus, arc 6 has a time constant of τ = 2 and
all others have τ = 1. Setting the initial values I1 = 1, I2 =
0 and D = 0 and computing the LSSs for τ = 1 activation of
C and O1 occurs. We can then fix the state of D (D = 1)
and get then a complete deactivation of C and O1.
(3) In real signaling and regulatory networks, it is some-
times difficult to decide whether arcs from the interactiongraph have to be linked by an AND or an OR in the inter-
action hypergraph. For example, in TOYNET, species E is
inhibited by factor I1 and activated by factor I2. If I1 hasa very strong inhibiting effect on E we may formulate thehyperarc as done in Figure 8, suggesting that I1 must notbe active for activating E. However, if the interactionstrength of both I1 and I2 with respect to E is at the same
level (i.e. additive) neither "NOT(I1) OR I2" nor
"NOT(I1) AND I2" would reflect the real situation.Indeed, this is a recurring situation in signaling networks,where often a balance between different signals deter-mines the activation of a certain element. At this point itcould be helpful to use logical operations that have a par-
tially incomplete truth table. In the latter example we
could say that E is active if (NOT(I1) AND I2) and E isinactive if (I1 AND NOT(I2)). For the other two possiblecases, no decision could be made along this hyperedge. Ofcourse, modeling uncertainty in this way will limit thedeterminacy but on the other hand a determined resultwith this model allows a safer interpretation.
Analyzing interaction networks using CellNetAnalyzer
We have integrated many of the methods and algorithms
described herein in our software tool CellNetAnalyzer ,
which is a MATLAB package and the successor of FluxAna-
lyzer [56]. Whereas FluxAnalyzer was originally developed
for structural and functional analysis of metabolic net-
works, CellNetAnalyzer extends these capabilities conse-
quently to the structural analysis of signaling andregulatory networks. Apart from stoichiometric (meta-bolic) reaction networks, CellNetAnalyzer supports now
also the composition of logical interaction hypergraphs
using AND, OR and NOT connections. Whenever needed,the underlying interaction graph can be deduced from theinteraction hypergraph. Alternatively, by using only OR'sand NOT's, arbitrary interaction graphs can be con-structed. As in FluxAnalyzer , the network model can be
linked with externally created graphics visualizing the net-
work. User interfaces (text boxes) enable data input andoutput directly in these interactive maps (see screenshotin Figure 10). New functions for graph-theoretical andlogical analysis have been integrated into the user menu;

Abstract
Terminal differentiation of B cells is an essential process for the humoral immune response
in vertebrates and is achieved by the concerted action of several transcription factors inresponse to antigen recognition and extracellular signals provided by T-helper cells. Whilethere is a wealth of experimental data regarding the molecular and cellular signals involvedin this process, there is no general consensus regarding the structure and dynamical prop-erties of the underlying regulatory network controlling this process. We developed a dynam-ical model of the regulatory network controlling terminal differentiation of B cells. Thestructure of the network was inferred from experimental data available in the literature, andits dynamical behavior was analyzed by modeling the network both as a discrete and a con-tinuous dynamical systems. The steady states of these models are consistent with the pat-terns of activation reported for the Naive, GC, Mem, and PC cell types. Moreover, themodels are able to describe the patterns of differentiation from the precursor Naive to any of
the GC, Mem, or PC cell types in response to a specific set of extracellular signals. We sim-
ulated all possible single loss- and gain-of-function mutants, corroborating the importanceof Pax5, Bcl6, Bach2, Irf4, and Blimp1 as key regulators of B cell differentiation process.The model is able to represent the directional nature of terminal B cell differentiation andqualitatively describes key differentiation events from a precursor cell to terminally differenti-ated B cells.
Author Summary
Generation of antibody-producing cells through terminal B cell differentiation represents
a good model to study the formation of multiple effector cells from a progenitor cell type.This process is controlled by the action of several molecules that maintain cell type specific
programs in response to cytokines, antigen recognition and the direct contact with T
helper cells, forming a complex regulatory network. While there is a large body of experi-mental data regarding some of the key molecules involved in this process and there havebeen several efforts to reconstruct the underlying regulatory network, a general consensus

well understood how this network controls the establishment of specific B cell expressionpatterns and how it responds to specific external signals. We present a model of the regula-
tory network controlling terminal B cell differentiation and analyze its dynamical behavior
under normal and mutant conditions. The model recovers the patterns of differentiationof B cells and describes a large set of gain- and loss-of-function mutants. This model pro-
vides an unified framework to generate qualitative descriptions to interpret the role of
intra- and extracellular regulators of B cell differentiation.
Introduction
Adaptive immunity in vertebrates depends on the rapid maturation and differentiation of T
and B cells. While T cells originate cell-mediated immune responses, B cells are responsible for
the humoral response of the organism by means of the production of high-affinity antibodies.B cells develop in the bone marrow from hematopoietic progenitors, and migrate as mature B
cells (Naive) to the germinal centers (GCs), which are highly specialized environments of the
secondary lymphoid organs [
1]. There, B cells are activated by antigens (Ag) and undergo
diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) genes by somatic hypermutation (SHM), as well asthe subsequent expression of distinct isotypes by class switch recombination (CSR) [
2]. After
the activation due to Ag recognition, Naive and GC B cells differentiate into antibody-produc-
ing plasma cells (PC), as well as memory cells (Mem) [ 3]. Cytokines secreted by T-helper cells,
such as IL-2, IL-4 and IL-21 as well as the direct contact with these cells, mediated by the union
CD40 receptor on B cells with its ligand CD40L, play a key role in the determination of B cell
fate [ 4], since these external signals act as instructive cues that promote the differentiation
from a cell progenitor to multiple cell types ( Fig 1 ).
Terminal differentiation of B cells is controlled by the concerted action of multiple tran-
scription factors that integrate physiologic signals in response to BCR cross-linking, extracellu-lar cytokines, and the direct interaction with T cells, thus creating a complex regulatorynetwork. These factors appear to regulate mutually antagonistic programs and can be divided
into those that promote and maintain B cell identity, such as Pax5, Bcl6 and Bach2, and those
that control differentiation into memory cells or plasma cells, i.e., Irf4, Blimp1 and XBP1, ashas been shown by multiple functional, biochemical and gene expression analysis [
5–7].
A type is characterized by the expression of a specific set of master transcriptional regula-
tors. Naive B cells express Pax5 and Bach2, which are induced at the onset of B cell develop-ment, and are maintained through all developmental stages upon plasma cell differentiation [
8,
9]. Furthermore, Pax5 is essential for the maintenance of B cell identity, since Pax5 deficiency
results in the acquisition of multilineage potential [ 10]. Both Pax5 and Bach2 are required to
inhibit PC differentiation [ 11,12]. In addition to Pax5 and Bach2, GC cells express Bcl6, a tran-
scription factor necessary for germinal center formation that allows the SHM and CSR pro-
cesses to occur [ 13–15]. Development of B cells toward Mem cells requires Bcl6
downregulation and the induction of Irf4 [ 16,17]. Conversely, PCs are characterized by the
expression of Blimp1 and XBP1 that along with Irf4, inhibit the B cell identity program [ 5,18].
Although a number of molecules that play a key role in the process of the terminal differen-
tiation of B cells are known, it is not completely clear how such molecules regulate each otherto ensure the proper appearance of GC, Mem, and PC from progenitor Naive B cells. There
exist models describing several aspects of the differentiation of B cells such as the decisions pro-
moting the developmental processes of CSR and SHM [
19,20], the response to environmental

contaminants that disrupt B cell differentiation [ 21,22], the B cell exit from the GC phase for
the differentiation into plasma or memory cells [ 23], as well as the dynamics of B cell differenti-
ation inside the complex microenvironment of germinal centers [ 24,25]. Nonetheless, a gen-
eral consensus about the regulatory network controlling cell fate decisions of B lymphocytes islacking.
The modeling of regulatory networks has been shown to be a valuable approach to under-
stand the way cells integrate several signals that control the differentiation process [
26,27]. In
particular, the logical modeling approach has been useful to qualitatively describe biologicalprocesses for which detailed kinetic information is lacking [
28]. This type of modeling usually
focus on the nature and number of steady states reached by the network, which are often inter-
preted as stable patterns of gene expression that characterize multiple cell fates [ 29]. In this par-
adigm, the transit from one steady state to another occurs when cells receive a specific external
stimuli, such as hormones, cytokines, changes in osmolarity, etc. These external stimuli are
sensed and integrated to create an intracellular response that may trigger a global responsesuch as cell growth, division, differentiation, etc. External signals are usually continuous innature, i.e., they are present as concentration gradients of external molecules that may attain
different values of strength and duration. Therefore it becomes desirable to develop models
Fig 1. Terminal B cell differentiation. Precursor Naive B cells can differentiate into three possible cell types
depending on proper molecular stimuli. Cytokines secreted by T-helper cells play a central role in the
determination of B cell fate. IL-2 and IL-4 are required for the transition of Naive to GC cells. Direct contact of
B cells with T cells by means of the CD40L receptor promote the differentiation of Naive or GC cells towardthe Mem cell type. Antigen (Ag) activation drives terminal differentiation toward the PC cells, a process that is
favored by the presence of IL-21.

Abstract
Background: The complex yet flexible cellular response  to pathogens is orchestrated by the
interaction of multiple signalling  and metabolic pathways. The molecu lar regulation of this response
has been studied in great detail but comprehens ive and unambiguous diagrams describing these
events are generally unavailable. Four key signal ling cascades triggered early-on in the innate
immune response are the toll-like  receptor, interferon, NF-?B an d apoptotic pathways, which co-
operate to defend cells against a given pathogen. However, thes e pathways are commonly viewed
as separate entities rather  than an integrated networ k of molecular interactions.
Results: Here we describe the construction of a logically represented pathway diagram which
attempts to integrate these four  pathways central to innate im munity using a modified version of
the Edinburgh Pathway Notation. The pathway map is  available in a number of electronic formats
and editing is supported by yEd graph editor software.
Conclusion: The map presents a powerful visual aid for interpreting the available pathway
interaction knowledge and underscores the va luable contribution well constructed pathway
diagrams make to communicating large amounts of molecular interaction data. Furthermore, we
discuss issues with the limitations and scalability of pathways presented in this fashion, explore
options for automated layout of large pathway ne tworks and demonstrate how such maps can aid
the interpretation of functional studies.
Background
The innate immune response is executed at the molecular
level by a complex series of interwoven signalling path-ways. In this context, pathways may be defined as a net-work of directional interactions between the componentsof a cell which orchestrate an appropriate shift in cellular
activity in response to a specific biological input or event.Whilst our ability to perform quantitative and qualitativemeasurements on the cellular components has increasedmassively in recent years, as has our knowledge on howPublished: 23 April 2008

they interact with each other, we still struggle to translate
these observations into graphical and computationally
tractable models. However without such models we cannot hope to truly understand biology at a systems level.
Traditionally, representations of molecular pathways have
been produced ad hoc and frequently included in reviews
and original papers. Whilst they are clearly useful aids to
understanding cellular events, even at their best, they arenot sufficient by themselves, relying on extensive textualdescriptions to explain what is shown pictorially. Recentyears have seen considerable growth in the availability ofpublic and commercial databases offering searchable
access to pathways and interaction data derived from a
combination of manual and automated (text mining)extraction of primary literature, reviews and large-scalemolecular interaction studies. Using these tools it is pos-sible to view a range of canonical pathway views or gener-ate networks of interactions based on a given query.However, all of these efforts are let down by one or a
number of key factors. The notation used in diagrams to
depict one molecule's interaction with another is varied,often ambiguous and therefore limited in its ability todepict the exact nature of the relationship between com-ponents of a pathway. There is often a lack of direct accessto the experimental evidence relating to the interactions
depicted or to the dataset as a whole. Similarly, labelling
of the pathway components often uses non-standardnomenclature or mixes protein names from one specieswith that of another, such that again the reader is leftuncertain as to what exactly is being shown. Finally, path-way diagrams usually focus only on a small part of a bio-
logical system and one which often reflects the curator's
bias, such that the 'same' pathway described by differentindividuals may share little in common. Whatever thesource of these pathways and networks they generally suf-fer from graphically poor representation with ambiguityaround the precise identity of what is being shown and
the exact nature of their interaction. In order to address
these issues the groups of Kohn and Kitano began todevise new approaches to pathway notation using manyideas adopted from the electronics industry [1-3]. In par-ticular the MIM (molecular interaction map) notation [3]a form of entity-relationship representation and the proc-ess description notation (PDN) [1], respectively. Since
then there has been an increasing interest in the systems
biology community to develop a consensus view on astandard approach for representing biological pathways[4]. Whilst this process is now well advanced there is cur-rently no internationally agreed standard graphical nota-tion system for building pathway diagrams and a paucity
of worked examples of this type of notation in use. Exam-
ples of pathways that have been published using thesenotation systems include a molecular interaction map ofmacrophage signalling [5] and Toll-Like-Receptor signal-ling [6] which have been depicted using the PDN scheme
and cell cycle control and DNA repair presented in the
MIM notation [2].
Over the last four years we have been developing a nota-
tion scheme for the depiction of biological pathways thatborrows many of the ideas of existing notation systems
but attempts to address some of their short comings. The
Edinburgh Pathway Notation [26] uses a logical state-transition representation to describe biological pathways,similar to PDN. The work described here follows on fromthis initial publication and reports a modified version ofthe EPN scheme which is aligned with the developing
international SBGN standard but has a number of impor-
tant differences with the scheme as currently proposed.Crucially, the notation provides a logical context for inter-actions between components in the pathway, it can dis-play the temporal order of reactions and can be mappedto the machine-readable SBML (systems biology markuplanguage) [7]. Of primary importance to this notation
scheme and indeed the SBGN is the desire to develop
pathway maps that are 'readable' by a biologist. Since thepathway maps are primarily produced as a tool for com-munication it is critical that they are easily understanda-ble and the notation can be applied and read by biologistswith minimal training. Other objectives (of the SBGN) are
that the notation should be computable, compact, show
sub-cellular localization and be tolerable of incompleteknowledge. Whilst all of these objectives are valid, fulfill-ing them in practice is far from trivial and there are fewworked examples of large pathway diagrams depicted instandard notations, available in the public domain.
The innate immune response is orchestrated by series of
signalling pathways that have evolved to elicit an appro-priate defensive response to attack by pathogenic organ-isms. Pathogen sensing involves pattern recognitionreceptors such as the toll-like receptors (TLR's) which in
mammalian cells constitutes a family of up to 11 [8] trans-
membrane receptors each responsible for distinguishingparticular p
athogen-a ssociated m olecular p atterns
(PAMPs). Detection of pathogen molecules by thesereceptors results in the recruitment of various adaptor pro-teins and the activation of downstream signal transduc-tion cascades [9,10]. Activation of de novo gene expression
follows, which ultimately acts to recruit new proteins and
augment the response to infection. Interferons (IFNs) arecentral to this response, as are (amongst others) interferonregulatory factors (IRFs), JAK/STAT signalling proteinsand the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) family of proteins[11]. The IRF family of transcription factors bind specific
DNA sequences, as do the STAT proteins, present on the
promoter of target genes [12,13]. NF-?B signalling can reg-ulate transcription through a combination of NF-?B pro-tein homo- and heterodimers [14-17]. These pathways are

also known to regulate components of the apoptotic path-
way, thereby providing the potential for cells to undergo
a programmed cell death [18], the ultimate cellular sacri-fice in defence of the organism.
The TLR, IFN, NF-?B and apoptosis pathways are of central
importance in defining the macrophages response to
pathogens and do so in a highly inter-dependant manner
[11]. Extensive literature describing the pathways andtheir interconnectivity, like so many others in biology, isavailable but only from multiple and disparate sources. Inour effort to understand these events as a basis for inter-preting analyses of host-pathogen interactions and the
inflammatory response in the macrophage, we have
endeavoured to construct an integrated and logic-basedpathway diagram of signalling cascades fundamental tomacrophage activation using a current version of the EPNscheme. We present the results of these labours as anexample of our on going work in this area and hope thatthis map will be used to supplement and contrast with the
efforts of others [6] in this area.
Methods
Collection of Molecular Inte raction Data and Biological
Representation of Pathways
In an effort to describe and consolidate knowledge of
pathways central to macrophage activation we have con-
structed a pathway diagram based on published literature.Ideally, two published papers citing protein-protein orprotein-gene interactions were required for the inclusionof a given interaction on to the pathway diagram. In somecircumstances we accepted one piece of published evi-
dence if the paper described extensive experimental verifi-
cation of the interaction. This was deemed necessary astwo publications per interaction can limit inclusion ofpotentially interesting interactions included in otherpathway resources (KEGG, Reactome etc) and newly dis-covered interactions. It is also important to note that the
primary task of this exercise was to develop a 'consensus'
of knowledge and information about a given pathway.
A list of interactions to be mapped was compiled [see
Additional file 1], including details about the nature ofthe interaction and source of the information. A pathwaymap was then drawn using the principles laid down by the
EPN scheme. These include the concept that the molecu-
lar components of a pathway be they proteins, proteincomplexes and genes (or in principle any other cellularcomponent that plays a part in a pathway) are representedas simple shapes containing a unique and unambiguousidentifying label. Attempts to depict pictorially the func-
tional activity or functional domains of components have
been avoided as this adds to the visual complexity of thediagram and can be misleading. For consistency compo-nents (nodes) have been named by their official humangenome nomenclature (HGNC) symbol, although in cer-
tain instances we have felt it necessary due to the wide-
spread use of other naming conventions to supplementthis with additional annotation. For example we haveused the name tBID to differentiate the truncated (active)form of the protein from its precursor (BID) and similarlyin order to distinguish the native (inactive) form of cas-
pases we used the suffix Pro e.g. ProCASP3 from the active
cleaved form (CASP3). We have also included additionalnaming conventions to differentiate between proteinforms e.g. in the NF-?B pathway (p50, p52 etc) orincluded common aliases where they are prevalent in theliterature, these names being placed in brackets after the
official name. Whilst the use of such ad hoc naming con-
ventions is in theory undesirable, they are still in commonuse and alternative ways to differentiate between proteinforms is not supported under the HGNC and standardnaming conventions for describing proteins in their vari-ous modified forms (truncated, cleaved, activated bycleavage etc) does not yet exist. Where pathway compo-
nents are protein complexes, the name of the complex is
given as a concatenation of the names of its constituentparts, although this has in some cases been supplementedby the inclusion of common names such as 'apoptosome'to denote the complex between CASP9, CYCS and APAF1.Components are depicted at the site of their activity and
are shown only once in any given cellular compartment
unless different activation states of the components areknown due to phosphorylation, ubquitinisation, cleavageetc., when these molecular states may be shown as con-nected but individual entities. The state of a componentmay be shown as a supplement to the components name
e.g. active [A], inactive [I], phosphorylated [P]. Interac-
tions (edges) between components or transitions betweenone cellular compartment and another, are shown asarrows which either contact interacting partners viaBoolean logic operators (&, OR, NOT) and/or transition/annotation nodes that provide information as to the
nature of the interaction or transition from one state to
another. Attempts to depict molecular details of interac-tions and state transitions such as the exact site of a pro-tein's phosphorylation, have generally been avoided.Whilst important, if depicted on a map of this size theinformation quickly clutters up the diagram rendering itinaccessible to the casual reader. However, in cases where
such details are necessary to differentiate one component
form from another they should be added. Finally, layoutof the elements and interactions that make up the path-way should be such that it is relatively easy to follow thedirection and nature of flow of information from the ini-tial trigger to the eventual outcome. In an effort to achieve
this, where possible interacting map components are
drawn close together keeping edge lengths short and easyto follow, crossover of edges is kept to a minimum andevery effort is taken to keep connecting edges separate,
BMC Systems Biology  2008, 2:36 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/36

with a minimum number of changes in direction to get
from one point to another.
The pathway map was drawn using the freely available
program yEd graph editor (yFiles software, Tubingen, Ger-many). yEd is a general purpose graphical tool designedfor the depiction of networks. Although not specifically
designed for biological pathway depiction it has been
used previously for this and similar purposes [19,20] andhas a range of characteristics and capabilities that make itideally suited for the job. Initially pathways were laid outby hand. Areas of the canvas were defined as representingspecific compartments of the cell e.g. plasma membrane,
cytoplasm, nucleus etc., and cellular components and the
interactions in which they took part were drawn in theappropriate space. A section of the overall map describingIFNG receptor signalling laid out according to the cellularlocation of the components has been included as anexample of the notation scheme in action (Figure 1) anda list of notation symbols used here is provided in Figure
2.
The combined map of macrophage activation pathways
described here (Figure 3) is available for download [21]and presented in a number of image (.jpeg, .pdf) andgraphical formats (.xml, .graphml). The .graphml file [see
Additional file 2] can be opened in yEd graph editor [22]and in this format is available for editing or expansion.
PubMed IDs supporting the interactions of the pathway
are stored on appropriate edges within the .graphml ver-sion of the diagram. We have found the yEd program tobe relatively intuitive to use and to require minimal or notraining. Hence the pathway diagram presented here iseasily accessible, distributable and can be modified by
end users to suit their interests or knowledge-base. The
EPN can be mapped to SBML and we are in the process ofcreating a SBML version of the map described here.
As the complexity of maps increases and the interactions
between components become evermore intertwined,
manual organization of these events becomes time-con-
suming and difficult. However, the pathway diagramshave been specifically drawn as directional networks. Assuch layout of the pathway maps can be aided by use ofvarious automated layout algorithms. The hierarchicallayout and classic-orthogonal edge routing applicationswithin the yEd software were the most effective in terms of
providing an easily interpretable view of directional flow
in the diagram (Figure 4a, b). However, other layout algo-rithms such as the organic layout function (Figure 4c) canalso provide different views of the pathway. Furthermorethis pathway can be easily converted into a 3-D network(Figure 4d) in BioLayout Express
3D [23]. Whilst 3-D path-
way networks do not readily support user readability of

The pathway is arranged to flow from le ft to right. Components ar e coloured accordin g to type (protein, complex or gene)
and arranged within the sub-cellular compar tments in which they are active. This pathway is initiated by IFNG binding to its
receptor and a subsequent phosphorylation cascade involving a number of the JAK and STAT family of proteins. Several tran-
scriptionally active complexes are formed (STAT1 homodimer, ISGF3 complex,  STAT1:STAT1:IRF9 complex) and the pathway
culminates with the transcriptio nal activation of  target genes.

the interactions, it provides an environment where very
large graphs may be plotted (15,000 nodes, 2.5 millionedges) and queried. As such these tools can aid interpreta-tion of the innate structure within the network of interac-tions of large pathway diagrams and together provide asolution, albeit not necessarily a perfect one, to the issue
of scalability. With these capabilities it will be possible to
scale up these diagrams to the point where they may con-tain thousands of components, operators and transitionnodes.

Primary mouse bone marrow derived monocytes were

medium and counted before being plated in a 24-wellplate at a concentration of 5 × 10
5 cells/well. To differen-
tiate the cells from monocytes into primary macrophages,cells were then incubated for 7 days in DMEM-F12 growthmedia supplemented with 10% L929 cell suspension
releasing the MCP-1 macrophage stimulating factor, with
media changes on days 3 and 5. On day 7 the growthmedium was replaced with DMEM-12/10%FCS mediumcontaining 10 u/ml recombinant mouse interferon-gamma (Pierce-Thermofisher Scientific, Rockford US) andharvested 1, 2, 4 & 8 h following treatment or collected
pre-treatment (0 h). Total RNA was harvested from the
cells using an RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) according to man-ufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified and qualitycontrolled using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Nano-Symbols of the modified Edinburgh Pathway Notation Figure 2

are essential for capturing the dependencies  of an interaction. Transition nodes prov ide information as to the nature of the
interaction (such as cleavage, tr anslocation, phosphorylation). Ed ges are directional and can be coloured for vi sual impact. Di s-
tinctive arrow-heads are used to distinguish between the pathway inputs and outputs but are otherwise avoided. Instead in-line
edge annotation is used to add a visual cue as to the meaning of an edge. Cellular compartmental information is provided by
physical location and backdrop or by colouring nodes according to their sub-cellular location.

licate 150 ng samples of total RNA derived from two
separate wells per time point were labelled using theAffymetrix whole transcript labelling protocol and hybrid-ized for 16 h at 45°C to Affymetrix mouse exon 1.0 STarrays. They were then washed and scanned according tomanufacturer's recommendations.
Data (ArrayExpress Ac. No: E-MEXP-1490) was normal-

within Bioconductor [24] or using the annova function
within GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies, Stockport,Cheshire) with a 1.6 fold cut-off. In total 1,678 transcriptswere identified by one or both of these filters. The datacorresponding to this list was then loaded into the net-work visualization tool BioLayout Express
3D [23] using a
Pearson correlation cut-off of 0.9 to filter edges. The
resultant network graph (Figure 5a) of 1,491 nodes wasclustered using the graph-based clustering algorithm MCL
[25] set at an inflation value of 2.2 resulting in 26 clusters
(Figure 5a & b). Clusters composed of transcripts thatwere up-regulated were then further collated into 3groups; genes up-regulated at (1) 1–2 hours, (2) 2–4hours and (3) 4–8 hours post-treatment and genes thatwere both differently expressed and present on the inte-
grated pathway diagram were highlighted on the map.
Results and Discussion
We set out to use the EPN scheme as originally published
[26]. However, during construction of the maps describedhere the notation system was found to be too limiting to
convey certain biological concepts and overly compli-

Modifications made to the EPN werenot intended to change the built in logic of the notationscheme but rather merely enhance the visual characteris-

Introduction
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) isacomplex gastrointestinal tract disorder characterized by
afunctional impairment ofthegutwall affecting patientsÂ quality oflife[1,2]. IBD includes
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The natural course ofIBD ishighly variable
[3±6] and itsetiology isstillunknown. The incidence ofIBD hasdramatically increased world-
wide over thepast 50years [7],reaching levels of24.3 per100,000 person-years inUCand 20.2
per100,000 person-years inCDinthedeveloped countries [8].
There iscurrent evidence that Interleukin 6(IL6), Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα),
Interferon Gamma (IFNƔ), Interleukin 1beta (IL1û), Interleukin 22(IL22), Interleukin 17
(IL17) and Natural Killer cells (NK), among other signalling pathways, play relevant roles in
thepathogenesis ofIBD, which isareflection ofthecomplexity ofthat physiological system
[9±12]. That complexity indicates that auniversal treatment forIBD may notbefeasible for
thevast majority ofpatients [13,14]. Infact, current biological approved treatments areonly
palliative with ahigh percentage ofnon-responders. Forexample, around 50% ofIBD patients
treated with thecurrent standard ofcare, Infliximab (ananti-TNFα) orVedolizumab (ananti-
α4β7 integrin) donotrespond satisfactorily totherapy [15,16]. One characteristic ofthecur-
rent IBD biological treatments isthat approved therapies target justonesignalling pathway,
which might explain thehigh rate ofnon-responders and thelong-term inefficiency ofmost
treatments [15,17]. Inaddition, there isevidence tosuggest that optimal treatment forIBD
should involve acombination ofdifferent drugs [18,19]. Therefore, there isaneed, especially
forcomplex alterations such asimmune-mediated diseases, tochange theparadigm ofdrug
development, considering themain aspects (targets, cross-talking between pathways, therapy
combination) from anintegrative and computational perspective.
Given theaforementioned biological complexity ofimmune-mediated diseases and thefact
that current longitudinal data associated with themost relevant elements ofthesystem are
scarce, afullparameterization ofIBD related systems based onadifferential equation model
does notyetseem feasible. However, some attempts have been made todescribe quantitatively
theIBD systems. Forexample, Wendelsdorf etal.,[20] built aquantitative model based on
ordinary differential equations. However, some keydisease elements, such ascytokines and T
cells, were incorporated non-specifically (i.e., alltypes ofcytokine were grouped under the
generic element active cytokines) inthemodel structure, limiting itsusetoexplore potential
therapeutic targets. More recently, Dwivendi etal.,[21], based ontheresults ofaclinical trial
with theanti±IL6R antibody, Tocilizumab, have developed amultiscale systems model in
Crohn's disease, limited totheIL6±mediated immune regulation pathway.
Network analysis represents apromising alternative insuch data limited circumstances
[22±24]. Asmany molecular pathways inIBD arequalitatively well described, interaction net-
works may beasuitable approach forcharacterizing IBD. These networks aresimplified repre-
sentations ofbiological systems inwhich thecomponents ofthesystem such asgenes, proteins
orcells arerepresented bynodes and theinteractions between them byedges [25]. Boolean
network models, originally introduced byKauffman [26,27], represent thesimplest discrete
dynamic models. These models only assume twodiscrete states forthenodes ofanetwork,
ONorOFF, corresponding tothelogic values 1(active) or0(not active, butnotnecessarily
absent) [28]. Awell-designed logic model could generate predictive outcomes given asetof
initial conditions. Qualitative, logical frameworks have emerged asrelevant approaches with
different applications, asdemonstrated byagrowing number ofpublished models [29]. Com-
plementing these applications, several groups have provided various methods and tools tosup-
port thedefinition and analysis oflogical models, asitcanbeseen bytherecent achievements
oftheConsortium forLogical Models and Tools (CoLoMoTo) inlogical modelling [30].

There arealready several tools forBoolean modeling ofregulatory networks inwhich itispos-
sible todefine direct activation-inhibition relationships between thecomponents ofthenet-
work, such asBoolNet R[31] orGINsim [32]. More recently, theRpackage SPIDDOR
(Systems Pharmacology foreffIcient Drug Development OnR)among others, hasimple-
mented new types ofregulatory interactions and perturbations within thesystem, such asposi-
tiveand negative modulators and thepolymorphism-like alterations, which lead toricher
dynamics between thenodes [28].
Inthespecific case ofIBD, there have been initial attempts todevelop network models. The
multi-state modeling tool published byMei etal.,[33,34] canbeconsidered aproof ofconcept
intheapplication ofthese types ofnetworks inmucosal immune responses. However, the
number ofelements that thismodel considers and integrates islimited forIBD characteriza-
tion, since only sixdifferent cytokine types areincluded intheinter-cellular scale.
The objective ofthecurrent manuscript istopresent aBoolean based network model incor-
porating themain cellular and protein components known toplay akeyrole inIBD develop-
ment and progression. The model hasbeen built onwell-established experimental knowledge,
mostly ofhuman origin, and only including animal data when noother source ofinformation
wasavailable. Our aim hasbeen tobuild amodel structure facilitating keyaspects inthetreat-
ment ofimmune mediated disease, such astheselection ofthemost promising combination
therapies and thestudy oftheimpact ofpolymorphisms onpathway regulation, thus allowing
patient stratification and personalized medicine.
This study provides thescientific community with a(i)computational IBD model imple-
mented inSPIDDOR Rpackage [28], which allows translation ofBoolean models (excluding
models enclosing temporal operators) toastandard Markup language inSystems Biology for
qualitative models (SBML qual [35]) which promotes model interoperability, and (ii)areposi-
tory with themain and updated information known oftheimmune system and IBD, which
shows model transparency and allows model reusability. The proposed IBD model canbeeas-

Results
Graphical representation, repository, and Boolean functions
The graphical representation oftheIBD network isshown inFig1.Itconsists of43nodes and
298qualitative interactions located inthree different physiological areas corresponding to(i)
thelymph node, (ii)theblood and lymph circulatory system that irrigates theintestinal epithe-
lialcells and (iii)thegutlumen.
Definition ofallnodes and thefulldocumented regulatory interactions conforming the
model structure canbefound insupporting information S1Table and S2Table, respectively.
The S2Table isfundamental tounderstand therationale fortheselection and implementation

oftheBoolean functions (BF). Itwasorganized toprovide acomprehensive summary ofthe
301manuscripts (published over thelastthree decades) used tobuild themodel, highlighting
forexample whether (i)aspecific pathway wasreported tobealtered inIBD, or(ii)informa-
tion wassupported byhuman (more than the80% ofthenetwork structure) oranimal data.
The Boolean operators used todefine thenetwork model ofIBD were: theNOT operator
which isnoted asª!º,theAND operator which isnoted asª&ºand theORoperator which is
noted asª|º.Recent and innovative modulators and threshold operators previously described
byIrurzun-Arana etal.,2017 [28] were also part ofthearsenal ofBoolean elements used inthe
model proposed (see S1Fileforadetailed description ofthose additional Boolean elements).
Regarding theinput selection, asitisassumed that IBD iscaused byintestinal dysbiosis, an
environment ofdifferent bacteria wasrecreated selecting three different antigens which are
components ofmost Bacterial Gram positive and Gram negative. Therefore, during thedevel-
opment oftheproposed model thefollowing assumptions were made: First, there isachronic
exposure tobacterial antigens: Peptidoglycan (PGN), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Muramyl
dipeptide (MDP). PGN isacomponent ofthecellwall ofallbacteria, butinparticular of
gram-positive bacteria, LPS isacomponent oftheouter membrane ofGram-negative bacteria

[37], and MDP isaconstituent ofboth Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [38]. All
three elicit strong immune responses and seem toplay acritical role inthedevelopment and
pathophysiology ofIBD, asithasbeen hypothesized that theonset orrelapse ofIBD istrig-
gered byanimbalance inself-microbiota composition than cannot becontrolled byimmune
system [39]. Table 1lists theinitial conditions expressed bythecorresponding BF,and shows
that thenodes representing antigens arechronically expressed unless thenatural antimicrobial
peptides perforin (PERFOR), granzyme B(GRANZB) ordefensins (DEF) become active.
Second, there isanimpairment inantigen elimination inIBD patients [1,40,41], simulated
with thethreshold operator Ag_elim =6.The threshold operator means that PERFOR,
GRANZB, orDEF inhibit antigen activation when anyofthese three nodes have been activated
foratleast 6consecutive iterations (see Table 1).
Third, thefinal readout ofthenetwork model istheaverage expression oftheoutput node,
Metalloproteinases (MMPs). There issolid evidence that thisgroup ofproteins isdirectly asso-
ciated with intestinal fibrosis and tissue damage inIBD [42±46] supporting their useasarele-
vant biomarker inclinical practice asproposed byO'Sullivan etal.[47]. Asitcanbeseen in
Table 2,thenodes that directly activate MMPs arethenodes that have relevant roles inthe
pathogenesis ofIBD [9±12,42±44,46,48].
Table 2contains thefullsetofBFthat modulates thesignal initialized bytheantigens
through theactivation ofdifferent pattern recognition receptors (TLR2, TLR4 and NOD2
nodes) and theimpact ontheoutput node (MMPs) astherecipient oftheantigen signal inter-
nalmodulation. The nodes TNFα orIFNγ have themost complex pathways ascanbeseen in
thecorresponding Boolean equations (Table 2).
With theaim ofmaking thenetwork model more accessible tothecommunity ithasbeen
uploaded toªThe Cell Collectiveº [49,50] platform (https://www.cellcoll ective.org/#cb963d7f-
75cb-4b2e-8987-0c7592a9c21 d).Inaddition, thesupporting information document S2File
provides thenetwork model intextformat ready forsimulation intheR-based freely available
package SPIDDOR [28] and anhtml tutorial asaguide toreproduce theresults (S3File).
Perturbation analysis and clustering: Network robustness
The results ofthenetwork perturbation analysis arepresented inFig2.The heatmap shows
theimpact ofasingle blockage ofeach node inevery network node. The results indicate that
most node blockages didnottrigger considerable changes, suggesting that theIBD network is
robust [51]. Some perturbations ledtoahigher activation ofthenodes, while down regulations
were more common. The heatmap wascombined with ahierarchical clustering grouping
together thenodes that caused similar alterations. Knockout oftheNFkû node appeared tobe
themost relevant alteration asitcaused areduction inexpression ofmany ofthenodes that
were reported tobeoverexpressed inIBD patients. The knockout oftheTh0 node (represent-
ingactivated CD4+ Tcells) also elicited areduction inMMPs. The positive effects oftheNFkû
and Th0 node blockades onMMPs decreased expression, resembled some oftheknown mech-
anisms ofaction ofglucocorticoids, inhibitors ofTcellactivation and proinflammator yTable 1.Boolean functions (BF) oftheIBD model tosimulate theinitial conditions .

Network accuracy and validation
Experimental and clinical information. Simulations ofchronic infection inIBD individ-
uals show that themodel reproduced satisfactorily experimental and clinical information
(summarized inTable 3and supporting information S3Table). Fig3shows theresults ofthe
simulation foreach network node after reaching theattractor state forvirtual healthy and IBD
subjects. Intotal, 31upregulations inexperimental studies were replicated with oursimula-
tions. Similarly, the9nodes reported asaltered appeared upregulated inthesimulations, and
finally, thethree nodes whose profiles were notknown also proved tobeupregulated.
Clinical trials. Inoursimulations, three drugs that have failed toprove clinical efficacy in
clinical trials (anti-IL17, anti-IFNγ and rhuIL-10) also exhibited nobenefit inthesimulated
surrogate forthedisease score (Fig 4).Simulations with anti-TNFα, abiologic therapy
approved forIBD, showed adecrease inthedisease score. Simulations with anti-IL12-IL23, a
recently approved therapy forIBD, showed aslight decrease inMMPs and anti-IL2 therapy
simulation showed adecrease similar toanti-TNFα. Inaddition, thenew promising therapy
(GMA), equivalent toananti-MACR inourmodel showed adecrease inMMPs similar tothat
foranti-TNFα.
Discussion
Inthecurrent study, wepresent aSystems Pharmacology (SP) network model forIBD based
onthemain cells and proteins involved inthedisease. Our analysis appears timely, asIBD has
recently been attracting increasing attention [55±59]. Weattempted tomeet oneofthemajor
challenges ininflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which istheintegration ofIBD-related infor-
mation toconstruct apredictive model. Wearenottheonly ones following thislineof
research, asLauren APeters etal.have very recently performed akeydriver analysis toidentify
thegenes predicted tomodulate network regulatory states associated with IBD [55]. Both anal-
yses could beintegrated inthefuture and inform ourpost-transcriptomi cnetwork with the
keydriver genes identified byLauren APeters etal.[55].
Incomparison with theprevious quantitative approaches forIBD [20,21,33,34], ourmodel
identified Naive CD4+ TCells, Macrophages and Fibroblasts cells asrelevant inIBD. Also, in
addition tothesixinterleukins (TGFû, IL6, IL17, IL10, IL12 and IFNγ) considered byMei
etal.[33,34] ournetwork involves 10interleukins more which could represent possible IBD
biomarkers [60]. The procedure toevaluate thepotential role ofthedifferent components on
thedisease asplausible biomarkers, would beequal totheonedescribed insection 4.5(pertur-
bation analysis and clustering), focussing onthechanges intheoutput node.
Inthevalidation ofnetwork models, robustness and practical applicability represent critical
aspects. The factthat theinformation gathered from theliterature wasobtained under veryTable 2.(Continu ed)

different experimental designs/conditions/me thodologies, represents achallenge with respect
tovalidation. This ledustopropose and adopt anovel strategy consisting ofthecomparison of
theresults ofmodel-based virtual pathway simulations with those reported intheliterature for
IBD patients. Using thisapproach, weobtained aqualitative reproduction ofIBD inwhich all
thenetwork elements that have been reported asupregulated inIBD patients appeared upre-
gulated inoursimulation results. The perturbation analysis ofthenetwork wasperformed bya
single blockage ineach node toanalyse how that type ofalteration propagates through the
entire network reflecting thecase ofsingle polymorphisms, which represents thesimplest case
ofIBD disease. Despite ofthesimplicity ofthisanalysis, theresults obtained from themodel
accuracy and validation procedures areencouraging. Results from theperturbation analysis
indicate that theproposed network model isrobust, asalteration inmost nodes didnottrigger
considerable changes inthenetwork [61].
Once validated and checked forrobustness, thenetwork waschallenged toqualitatively
reproduce thereadouts offivedifferent therapies reported inexperimental and clinical studies.
The outcome ofthischallenge wassimilar totheclinical output inIBD patients. Bythesimula-
tion ofTNFα orMACR knockout (simulating Granulocyte and Monocyte Apheresis), a
decrease inMMPs node wasobserved, which isinlinewith therapy success inclinical practice
byadecrease inCrohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score [42±46],[62±68]. Onother
hand, IL17 orIFNγ knockout orIL10 overexpression didnotshow major change inMMPs
expression, suggested afailed therapy aswasindeed found inclinical practice [69±72].
Surprisingly, themodel shows that aknockout ofIL2leads toareduction inMMPs similar
tothat ofaknockout ofTNFα, even when previous results ofclinical trials with Basiliximab or
Daclizumab (monoclonal antibodies that bind totheinterleukin 2receptor CD25) inUlcera-
tiveColitis have failed toshow superiority tocorticosteroids alone [73,74]. The mechanism ofFig2.IBD network perturba tion analysis and clustering. The heatmap indicates theeffect ofsingle blockage ofeach node (column s)inevery network

that theperturbatio ncauses adownreg ulation ofthenode. The numeric scale inthelegend represents differe ntvalues ofthenodes PIunder differe nt

areduemainly tolack ofefficacy [79], and (iii)management ofmultiscale information such as
theintegration ofproteomic gene expression data [55] accounting forIBD polymorphisms to
anticipate responders and non-responders. With such atype ofdata able tocorrelate agenetic
alteration with adecrease oranincrease inprotein expression, itwould bepossible tosimulate
specific genetic alteration byaltering theprotein expression. This would allow oneofthelimi-
tations ofthecurrent network atthepresent time tobeovercome with regard totheeffects of
Ustekinumab, amonoclonal antibody targeting free IL12 and IL23, which hasbeen recently
approved formoderately toseverely active Crohn's disease inadults who have failed totreat-
ment with immunomodulators, ormore than oneTNFα blocker [80]. Simulation results
based ontheknown mechanisms ofUstekinumab showed justa4.1% decrease intissue dam-
age. Ontheother hand, when simulating TNFα blocker effects, tissue damage decreased by
30.6% even though asubstantial percentage ofpatients showed poor control ofthedisease
after treatment with anti-TNFα antibody [15,16].

ofdetailed quantitative models forwithin-host disease dynamics. The current IBD model and
thecompanion literature summary archive willdrive thedevelopment ofadynamic (i.e., ordi-

Methods
Literature search and data selection
The network model isbased onanexhaustive bibliographic review focusing ontheessential
components ofIBD, aspreviously performed byRuiz-Cerda Âetal.,intheir systems pharmacol-
ogyapproach forlupus erythematosus [23]. Our review included around 620papers published
between October 1984 and September 2017, yetthemost common reviewed articles were from
2007 orlater (76%). The search oftherelevant literature wasmade through Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) terms using different search engines such asPubMed, clinicaltrials.gov or
google scholar. MeSH terms were focused onthecombination ofkeywords and free words
including: (i)relevant network components (ej.ºIL6º) involved inthepathogenesis ofIBD, (ii)
nodes that have been reported tobealtered inIBD (ej.ªIL6 AND IBDº) and (iii)nodes directly
affecting theexpression ofthenodes selected in(i)and (ii)(ej.ªDC AND IL6º). The internal
nodes selection wasmade according tothereported upregulated components inIBD patients
together with thenodes (immune system cells) which arenecessary tolink theupregulated
nodes, which were established asinternal nodes. Only original papers with aclear description
ofexperimental conditions were considered toidentify therelationships between thecompo-
nents ofthebiological network. Due tothereported differences between animal and human
immunology [83±85], inonly fewcases were animal data considered toconnect nodes ofcriti-
calpathways when nohuman data were available.

Boolean network building and rimplementation
The collection ofqualitative relationships extracted from theliterature wastransformed into a
logical model asdescribed before byRuiz-Cerda Âetal.[23]. Logic networks capture thedynam-
icsoftheir components, called nodes, after selected stimuli orinitial conditions [89,90]https://
paperpile.com/c/XvtklO/p0BRz +YiQ4q. Inthese models therelationships ofactivation or
inhibition between nodes aredescribed ascombinations ofthelogic operators: AND, ORand
NOT condensed inamathematical expression called aBoolean function foreach node. Posi-
tiveand negative modulators, and thresholds aspreviously described byRuiz-Cerda Âetal.[23]
and Irurzun-Arana etal.[28] were also considered toresemble better thebiological system.

Simulations
The setofcombined Boolean functions fortheIBD model wasimplemented SPIDDOR [28],
using RStudio Version 0.99.442. Simulations with 25repetitions over 5000 iterations were per-
formed. According topreliminary experiments, these simulation conditions were required to
achieve thesteady state ofthenetwork called attractor [91±93]. Anattractor canbeafixed-
point ifitcomposed ofonestate, asimple cycle ifconsists ofmore than onestate that oscillates

centage ofactivation oftheoutput node (MMPs) calculated attheattractor state wasused as
thereadout summary ofthesimulation exercises, asthisgroup ofproteins aredirectly associ-
ated with intestinal fibrosis and tissue damage inIBD [42±46].
Each node wasupdated asynchronously [94±96] according toitsBoolean function that

Perturbation analysis and clustering
Robustness canbedefined asthesystem's ability tofunction normally under stochastic pertur-

dependence between robustness and network connectivity [97]. Weperformed aperturbation
analysis inourIBD model tostudy robustness bysimulating theeffect ofthesingle blockage of

signaling reveals the stability of signal
propagation
Xiao Gan and Réka Albert*
Abstract
Background: Analyzing the long-term behaviors (attractors) of dynamic models of biological systems can provide
valuable insight into biological phenotypes and their stability. In this paper we identify the allowed long-term
behaviors of a multi-level, 70-node dynamic model of the stomatal opening process in plants.
Results: We start by reducing the model ’s huge state space. We first reduce unregulated nodes and simple mediator
nodes, then simplify the regulatory functions of selected nodes while keeping the model consistent with experimental
observations. We perform attractor analysis on the resulting 32-node reduced model by two methods: 1. converting it
into a Boolean model, then applying two attractor-finding algorithms; 2. theoretical analysis of the regulatory functions.
We further demonstrate the robustness of signal propagation by showing that a large percentage of single-node
knockouts does not affect the stomatal opening level.
Conclusions: Combining both methods with analysis of perturbatio n scenarios, we conclude that all nodes except two
in the reduced model have a single attractor; and only two nodes can admit oscillations. The multistability or oscillations
of these four nodes do not affect the stomatal opening level in any situation. This conclusion applies to the original
model as well in all the biologically meaningful cases. In addition, the stomatal opening level is resilient against single-
node knockouts. Thus, we conclude that the complex structur e of this signal transduction network provides multiple
information propagation pathways while not allowing extensiv e multistability or oscillations, resulting in robust signal
propagation. Our innovative combination of methods off ers a promising way to analyze multi-level models.

Background
Modeling offers a comprehensive way to understand bio-
logical processes by integrating the components involved
in them and the interactions between components.
Models can recapitulate and explain the emergent out-
come(s) of the process [1, 2]. Representing cellular pro-
cesses that involve many proteins and small molecules
by a signal transduction network can reveal indirect rela-
tionships between components and provide new insight
[3–5]. Such network usually consists of nodes represent-
ing biological entities, and edges representing interac-
tions. Once a network has been constructed, dynamicmodeling, where each node in the network is associated
with a variable representing its abundance or activity,
can further describe the behavior of the network. Dy-
namic models can have continuous variables whose
change is described by differential equations [6], discrete
variables described by discrete (logical) regulatory func-
tions [7, 8], or a combination of continuous and discrete
variables [9]. The major advantage of discrete dynamic
and continuous-discrete hybrid models is that they use
many fewer parameters than continuous models and
thus need less parameter estimation [10 –12]. Modeling
allows one to analyze the biological system represented
by the network in silico , when performing the relevant
experiment is infeasible. It also helps identify general
principles of biological systems [13, 14].* Correspondence: rza1@psu.edu

The biological process of stomatal opening in plants is
a good example of a complex system wherein modeling
leads to significant gain in understanding [15, 16]. Sto-
mata are pores on leaf surfaces that allow the plant to
exchange carbon dioxide (CO 2) and oxygen with the at-
mosphere. Stomata are formed by two guard cells that
can change shape: swelling of guard cells leads to stoma-
tal opening; their shrinking leads to stomatal closure.
The shape of each guard cell is directly controlled by
water flow through the membrane, which is in turn con-
trolled by ion flow. Different signals can affect the guard
cell, changing its ion concentration in direct and indirect
ways, resulting in stomatal opening or closure [17 –19].
These signals include light of different wavelengths, CO 2
concentration in the air, and plant hormones like absci-
sic acid (ABA). The regulation of stomatal opening is es-
sential to plants, as it controls vital activities like the
uptake of CO 2for photosynthesis, and the unavoidable
water loss through evaporation [20]. Through extensive
experimentation over several decades, more than 70proteins and small molecules have been identified to
participate in this process.
Sun et al. [15] recently constructed a signal transduc-
tion network based on conclusions from more than 85
articles in the literature, describing how more than 70
nodes (proteins, small molecules, ions) interact with
each other in the stomatal opening process. The net-
work, reproduced as Fig. 1 [15], includes four source
nodes that correspond to the signals red light, blue light,
CO 2, and ABA. The more than 150 edges are directed
and signed, with arrowheads indicating activation and
terminal black circles indicating inhibition.
Translating this network into a dynamic model, Sun et
al. characterized each node with a discrete variable de-
scribing its activity and with a discrete (logical) regula-
tory function describing its regulation. Twenty-one out
of the 70 nodes in the model are multi-level, the rest are
Boolean (binary). The levels reflect relative and qualita-
tive information: a level of 2 is a higher level than 1, but
should not be interpreted as twice as high. A few
Fig. 1 The signal transduction network responsible for stomatal opening, as reconstructed by Sun et al. [15]. The color of a node marks which
signal regulates this node. Red nodes are regulated solely by red light. Blue nodes are regulated solely by blue light. Yellow nodes are regulated
solely by ABA. Grey nodes are regulated by CO 2. Purple nodes are regulated by both blue and red light. Green nodes are regulated by blue (and
potentially, red) light and ABA. White nodes are source nodes not regulated by any of the four signals. To improve visualization, certain pairs of
edges with the same starting or end nodes overlap. Nodes with multiple levels in the dynamic model are represented by red shadows; the
others are Boolean. The full names of the network components denoted by abbreviated node names are given in Table 1. This figure and part of
its caption is reproduced from Sun Z, Jin X, Albert R, Assmann SM (2014) Multi-level Modeling of Light-Induced Stomatal Opening Offers New
Insights into Its Regulation by Drought. PLoS Comput Biol 10(11): e1003930. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003930Gan and Albert BMC Systems Biology  (2016) 10:78 
discrete values are not integers; e.g. stomatal opening is
a weighted sum with non-integer weights. The dynamic
model has ~1031states. The logical regulatory functions,
describing each node ’s future state based on the states of
the node ’s regulators, use a combination of Boolean logic
operators ( And, Or, Not ), algebraic operations, and
input-output tables. For example, the regulatory function
of PRSL1 is:
PRSL1/C3¼phot1 complex Orphot2 :
Here for simplicity the node states are denoted by the
node names; the asterisk in “PRSL1* ”indicates that this
will be the next state of the PRSL1. The “Or”Boolean
operator expresses that either of the blue light receptors,
i.e. the phot1 complex or phot2, can independently acti-
vate PRSL1.
The Sun et al. model starts from an initial condition
representative of closed stomata. Then a combination of
the four input signals is applied. Red light, blue light,
and ABA are represented as binary variables, and exter-
nal CO 2is represented with three states: 0 (CO 2free
air), 1 (ambient CO 2) and 2 (high CO 2). The system ’s re-
sponse is simulated through repetitive re-evaluation of
each node ’s state until a stable value of stomatal opening
is observed. The model successfully captures stomatal
opening in response to combinations of the signals. It
also successfully reproduces stomatal opening under
most of the experimentally studied perturbation scenar-
ios (i.e. genetic knockouts or external supply of compo-
nents). In total, the model is consistent with 63 out of
66 experimental observations collected by Sun et al.
[15]. The model predicts the outcome of a large number
of scenarios that have not been explored experimentally
so far. It also revealed a gap of knowledge regarding the
cross-talk of red light and ABA signaling, and filled it
with a newly predicted interaction.
Although the Sun et al. model recapitulates existing
knowledge and offers new predictions, the model ’sf u l l
dynamic repertoire could not be characterized due to its
large state space. Instead, Sun et al. focused on tracking the
output node, stomatal opening, and a few selected internal
nodes, in time. In this paper we apply multiple methods to
analyze the model and aim to fully map all its potential
long-term behaviors, or in other words, attractors.
Methods
Attractors of a dynamical system
An attractor is a set of states from which only states in
the same set can be reached. Attractors that consist of a
single state are called stable steady states or fixed points;
attractors that contain multiple states are called complex
attractors or oscillations [10]. In biological networks,
attractors often have significant biological meaning. In acell signaling network, attractors correspond to cell
types, cell fates or behaviors [21]. For example, one at-
tractor can represent a healthy differentiated cell, while
another attractor can represent an abnormally motile
cancer cell [22].
Update scheme of a discrete time model
In the Sun et al. model, as in most discrete dynamic
models, time is an implicit variable. As there is very little
information about the kinetics of the nodes in the sto-
matal opening network, the model incorporates an elem-
ent of stochasticity in timing. The timing does not affect
a system ’s fixed point attractors, but it can change the
complex attractors and the possibility of reaching a
given attractor from a given initial state [10]. In the Sun
et al. model, a random –order asynchronous update is
used. Specifically, at each time step, a random order of
nodes (excluding the four input nodes and the output
node stomatal opening) is generated, and each node ’s
state is reevaluated in this order; stomatal opening is al-
ways updated last. In the next time step a different order
is generated randomly. In this paper, we use a different
type of stochastic update, called general asynchronous
update, wherein a randomly selected node is updated at
each time step. This is required by the network reduc-
tion method we use. Although this theoretically could
cause a difference in complex attractors, we will show
that in this specific model the two update methods yield
the same attractors.
Network reduction
To reduce the Sun et al. model ’s state space, we apply a
network reduction method developed by Saadatpour et
al. [23] that is proven to preserve the attractors of a
Boolean model. Two types of nodes can be reduced
(eliminated or merged): source nodes with no incoming
edges, and simple mediator nodes that have one incom-
ing and/or one outgoing edge. In the reduction, the
source node ’s state is directly plugged into the regulatory
function of all of its direct successor nodes; then the
source node is eliminated. For a simple mediator node
with one predecessor (regulator) and one successor (tar-
get), its regulator is connected to its target and the me-
diator node is merged into the regulator. If there is one
regulator and several targets of the mediator node, but
no direct edges between the regulator and any of the tar-
gets, the mediator node is merged into the regulator.
Conversely, if there are several regulators and one target
of the mediator node, but no direct edges among any of
the regulators and the target, the mediator node is
merged into its target. Although this method is not
proven in the multi-level case, we conjecture that attrac-
tors are also conserved for a multi-level model, and willGan and Albert BMC Systems Biology  (2016) 10:78 
show from the results that in the Sun et al. model this
reduction method preserved all attractors.
Elimination of redundant edges
During the process of creating a discrete dynamic model
from biological data, when an influence is weaker than
other influences, the modeler may choose to omit this
influence or, alternatively, include it a redundant way.
The latter choice was made by Sun et al. in four cases,
leading to four regulatory functions that contain an in-
put that does not affect the outcome of the regulatory
function. One of these is
ROS/C3¼NADPH And AtrbohD =FOrNADPH
And AtrbohD =FAnd CDPK Or Not Atnoa1
The italicized words “And ”,“Or”and “Not ”are Bool-
ean logic operators; the non-italicized words represent
node names. In this regulatory function every node is
Boolean (binary). The first clause “NADPH And Atr-
bohD/F ”and the second “NADPH And AtrbohD/F
And CDPK ”are connected with an “Or”rule, with the
result that the node “CDPK ”does not have any influence
on the outcome. Therefore, we can prune the edge from
CDPK to ROS without changing the model ’s dynamics.
We similarly prune three additional redundant edges.
Converting a multi-level model to Boolean
There are several possibilities to convert a multi-level
model to Boolean [24]. The standard method used in the
case of logical models of regulatory networks is the Van
Ham mapping [25, 26]. It preserves the dynamics of the
original model if the variables in the original model can
be represented by integers and if the original model only
allows state transitions in which one node changes its
state by one level [26]. The Sun et al. model does not
satisfy these criteria. However there still is a conclusion
that we can use: All types of conversions maintain the
fixed points and the reachability of states (i.e. if there is
a sequence of state transitions from state A to state B
before conversion, there must be a sequence of state
transitions from the corresponding state A ’to state B ’
after the conversion) [26]. So the worst distortion of
attractors due to the conversion is the merging of two
complex attractors into one. In this light we choose to
use an economic mapping of each multi-level node into
as many Boolean nodes as necessary for the binary rep-
resentation of the corresponding integer. We will show
that in this specific model, the conversion did not
change the attractors.

ponents denoted by abbreviated node names in Fig. 1.The same abbreviations are used in the original Sun et
al. model and the reduced model developed in this
paper.
Results
Network reduction
The Sun et al. model has a huge state space of ~1031
states, making its analysis difficult. To obtain a smaller
state space, we reduce the size of the network by applying
a network reduction technique developed by Saadatpour
et al. [23] that is proven to preserve the attractors of Bool-
ean models (see Methods). All source nodes other than
the four signals (blue light, red light, CO 2, and abscisic
acid) and all simple mediator nodes are identified and re-
duced. This process is done iteratively until it cannot be
done any more. A total of 7 source nodes (14-3-3 protein-
phot1,P I P 2 C, AtNOA1, Nitrate, PP1 cn, mitochondria, and
CHL1), and 19 simple mediator nodes (phot1, phot2,
NIA1, H+-ATPase, LPL, ATP , acid. of apoplast, [NO 3−]v,
[Cl−]v,N A D P H ,[ m a l a t e2−]v, PA, ABA receptors, OST1,
PRSL1, PIP2 PM, AtrbohD/F, Nitrite, and phot1 complex )a r e
eliminated. Several of the simple mediator nodes form lin-
ear paths (e.g. phot1, OST1) thus their iterative reduction
shortens the linear paths in the network. In addition, 16 of
the 19 reduced mediators have a regulatory function of
the form “B* = A ”. It is intuitive that reduction of this node
type preserves the attractors.
We do not eliminate the four signal nodes because we
want to simultaneously explore all the combinations of
input signals. We also choose to not reduce the five
nodes (K in,Kout,Kc,C a2+-ATPase, mesophyll cell photo-
synthesis) whose merging with their sole regulator would
result in a self-loop (self-regulation), because such self-
loops may be difficult to interpret. Two additional nodes
with significant biological meaning to the network
(sucrose, stomatal opening), are not reduced either.
Another form of network reduction is the elimination
of redundant edges (see Methods). After removal of re-
dundant edges, the node CDPK becomes a sink node,
thus it can also be eliminated. The reduction of the
above-described nodes and redundant edges simplifies
the network from 70 nodes to 42 nodes, with an esti-
mated state space of ~1022states.
Simplification of regulatory functions
In order to further reduce the state space from ~1022to
a manageable size, we grouped state values so that nodes
are represented with fewer states. This grouping was
guided by the 66 experimental observations summarized
in Sun et al.; we aimed to maintain the reduced model ’s
results consistent with these experimental observations.
For example, in the Sun et al. model [15] the regula-
tory function of Stomatal Opening is a weighted sum of
different ions and sucrose:Gan and Albert BMC Systems Biology  (2016) 10:78 
Stomatal opening/C3¼½Cl−/C138vcontribution
þ½NO 3−/C138vcontribution þ½Kþ/C138v
þ½malate2−/C138vcontribution þsucrose −RIC7 =6
The weights of the anion contributions to the
osmotic potential were chosen based on the literature.
Also, the anion contributions must not exceed a pro-
portion of [K+]vdue to charge balance. The anion
contributions are [malate2−]vcontribution ≤0.425 × [K+]v;
[NO 3−]vcontribution ≤0.10 × [K+]v;[ C l−]vcontribution ≤0.05 × [K+]v. The primary contributions come from [K+]v
and sucrose. We grouped the stomatal opening values into
6 groups with different [K+]vand sucrose values (see
T a b l e2a n dA d d i t i o n a lf i l e1 ) .
The first two columns indicate the [K+]vand su-
crose levels. The third column is the possible values

experimentally studied scenarios reported by Sun et
al. [15]. More stomatal opening values are possible
when considering node per turbations. The 4th col-
umn shows the simplified stomatal opening level after
grouping. The update function for the simplified sto-
matal opening level covers all possible values of [K+]v
and sucrose (see Additional file 1).
Similarly to the original model, the simplified states
represent qualitative, relative categories. For example, a
stomatal opening level of 2 is not twice as high as level
1. We choose the simplified stomatal opening values so
that there is no state “4”, to better reflect an experimen-
tally observed synergistic effect between blue and red
light [18, 19, 27]. Simulation results with the simplified
regulatory function are that under monochromatic red
light stomatal opening =1; under monochromatic blue
light stomatal opening =3; under dual beam the stomatal
opening =5, which is larger than the sum “1+3 ”. This
qualitatively reproduces the experimental observation
that under dual beam illumination stomata open to a
size much larger than the sum of opening under mono-
chromatic blue or red light.
We find by simulation of the reduced model, using
the same initial condition as the Sun et al. model,
that the simplification of the stomatal opening regula-
tory function results in only 3 additional cases of in-
consistency with experimental observations out of a
total of 66 experimentally studied scenarios. Add-
itional file 2 lists all experimental observations and com-
pares them to the relevant simulation results. Ignoring the
contribution of malate2−,N O 3−, and RIC7 to stomatal open-
ing each causes one additional discrepancy; ignoring Cl−
does not cause any additional discrepancy. Ignoring these
nodes trades a decrease in accuracy for a significant in-
crease in simplicity.
The simplification of the stomatal opening regulatory
function eliminates the effect of vacuolar anions and ofRIC7 on stomatal opening. As a result we can further
simplify the Sun et al. model by eliminating 10 nodes in
total, [malate2−]a, [malate2−]c, starch, [Cl−]c, [NO 3−]c,
[NO 3−]a, ROP2, RIC7, ABC, and PEPC. The only edge
from these nodes to other nodes is [malate2−]a→
AnionCh. In section 3 of Additional file 3 we show that
eliminating this edge does not change the system ’s long-
term behavior, i.e. attractors. Also, the regulatory func-
tion describing the cytosolic K+concentration, [K+]c, can
be simplified without loss, as described in section 3 of
Additional file 3. After this simplification we have a net-
work of 32 nodes, 81 edges, indicated on Fig. 2. We will
refer to this model as the “reduced model ”. A list of
nodes and their regulatory functions is provided in
Additional file 1.
Identifying strongly connected components (SCCs)
is important for attractor analysis, as complex dy-
namic behavior such as oscillations or multi-stability
requires feedback loops [7]. There are three SCCs in
the network of the reduced model, as marked in
Fig. 2. The NO cycle contains three nodes and three
positive edges. The C iSCC contains three nodes,
which form two negative feedback loops. The Ion
SCC is the most complex, containing 13 nodes and
26 edges, 7 of which are negative.
Next we perform attractor analysis using two
methods: 1. by converting the reduced model to Boolean
and applying two analysis tools; 2. by analyzing the regula-
tory functions theoretically. The former method finds all
stable steady states and candidate oscillations; the latter
confirms the results of the first method and gives insight
about perturbation scenarios.
Conversion of nodes from multi-level to Boolean states
and attractor analysis
We perform the conversion to Boolean to enable at-
tractor analysis by existing software tools. Zañudo et al.
[28] proposed an algorithm to find the attractors of a
Boolean network based on the concept of “stable motif ”,
a strongly-connected group of nodes that can stabilize
regardless of their inputs. The algorithm finds all stable
motifs, which determine the part of the network that
stabilizes in an attractor. After a stable motif is found,
one can plug in its stabilized state into the network, and
obtain a smaller remaining network. After repeating this,
eventually the remaining part is either nothing (indicat-
ing a fixed point/stable steady state) or a candidate oscil-
lating sub-network. Compared with other software tools
[29, 30], the major advantage of this algorithm is that it
finds all the attractors of Boolean networks with hun-
dreds of nodes [28]. Application of this powerful method
requires a Boolean model, so we convert the multi-level
model into Boolean first (see Methods). An example of
conversion is given in Table 3.Table 2 Grouping of the stomatal opening values by the level
of [K+]vand sucrose

More detailed examples of the conversion of the states
and regulatory function of specific nodes are given in
the Additional file 4. We will refer to the reduced model
after conversion to Boolean variables as the “Boolean-converted reduced model ”. The regulatory functions of
the Boolean-converted reduced model are available in
Additional file 5. When simulating the Boolean-
converted reduced model, all the Boolean nodes thatFig. 2 The stomatal opening network after model reduction, with 32 nodes and 81 edges. Nodes with shadows have multiple states; other nodes

represent the same entity (the same multi-level node)
are updated simultaneously. In this way the state transi-
tions of the reduced model will be kept the same in the
Boolean-converted reduced model, and therefore the
Boolean conversion will not cause additional discrepan-
cies from experimental observations.
We apply the stable motif algorithm ’s implementation,
downloaded from http://github.com/jgtz/StableMotifs/
[28], to the Boolean-converted reduced model. The algo-
rithm uses the Boolean regulatory functions of the con-
verted model (given in Additional files 5 and 6) as input.
We consider every combination of sustained states of
the five signal nodes (blue light, red light, ABA, CO 2,
CO 2_high). We find two possible stable motifs, corre-
sponding to the self-regulatory node PMV_pos (one of
the two Boolean nodes associated with the multi-level
node PMV, see Additional files 4 and 5), in conditions
where the H+-ATPase complex is inactive. These two stable
motifs indicate the bistability of PMV. Under its influ-
ence, another node, K out, will also be bistable. The algo-
rithm also indicates that for any signal combination,
every node, except [Ca2+]cand Ca2+-ATPase, will
stabilize in a fixed state. [Ca2+]chas three states, and in
the Boolean-converted model it is represented by two
nodes, Cac and Cac_high. Cac_high, which represents
the higher level of [Ca2+]c, stabilizes at zero in all situa-
tions. Cac and Ca2+-ATPase may oscillate in conditions
where blue light is present and ABA is absent (a total of
six cases, two of which allow PMV bistability). Table 4
summarizes key features of the attractors found by the
stable motif algorithm for all 24 input combinations.
Attractors where Ca2+oscillation is not possible are
fixed points (stable steady states).
We verified the obtained attractors with GINsim [12],
a software suite capable of model construction, simula-
tion, and analysis. GINsim can compute all stable steady
states (called stable states in GINsim), or determine
complex attractors by mapping the state transitions. The
stable steady states found by GINsim are identical to
those found by the stable motif algorithm. To verify and
further explore the complex attractors, we use the simu-
lation function of GINsim, starting from a state in the
complex attractor. The result that the system oscillatesbetween four states, where only the state of Cac and Ca2
+-ATPase changes, agrees with the findings of the stable
motif algorithm. We summarize the GINsim computa-
tion/simulation results in Additional file 7. Additional
file 8 indicates the Boolean-converted reduced model in
SBML-qual format [29], a general format for biological
model to be analyzed using various tools including
GINsim.
We can also connect the stable motif analysis results
to network reduction. We have previously decided to
not reduce the four nodes that correspond to input sig-
nals. If we do consider a specific input combination
when using network reduction, e.g. blue light and red
light with normal CO 2without ABA, we can reduce
much more of the network: two of the three SCCs,
namely the NO cycle and the C iSCC, will stabilize and
can be eliminated. Only the Ion SCC and its sole output
stomatal opening remain, indicating that this SCC is not
driven solely by the external signals and has the capacity
for oscillations or multi-stability. This is consistent with
the results found by stable motif analysis, according to
which the NO cycle and the C iSCC attain a steady state
and the Ion SCC admits a [Ca2+]c-C a2+-ATPase oscilla-
tion and PMV bistability. This consistency supports the
appropriateness of the network reduction method and of
the Boolean conversion.
Theoretical analysis of the reduced model
To gain additional insight into the attractors of the re-
duced model and their potential changes due to node
perturbations, we analyze the reduced model theoretic-
ally. Specifically, we aim to answer the question: Can
there be other types of oscillation, or can there be add-
itional multi-stability, if a node is knocked out (fixed in
the OFF state) or is constitutive active (fixed in the high-
est state)?
We first test whether the network and regulatory rules
allow multi-stability or oscillations. This analysis is based
on R. Thomas ’s conjectures [7]: The presence of a positive
(negative) feedback loop - a cycle with an even (odd) num-
ber of inhibitory edges - in the network is a necessary but
not sufficient condition for the occurrence of multiple
steady states (oscillations). The conjectures have been
proven in the case of discrete dynamic systems [31 –34].
Since only feedback loops are candidates for potential
multi-stability or oscillations, we analyze the regulatory
functions of each strongly connected component of the
network. For each feedback loop, we identify a sufficient
condition for the nodes to stabilize in a specific state. The
violation of this condition becomes a further necessary
condition of multi-stability or oscillation. Here we de-
scribe the main steps and results of the analysis; the de-
tailed analysis is in Additional file 3.Table 3 Example of Boolean conversion

The multi-level node shown in the 1st column is mapped into two Boolean
nodes, shown in the 2nd and 3rd columns, using the binary representation of
the corresponding integer.Gan and Albert BMC Systems Biology  (2016) 10:78 
The NO cycle is composed of the nodes PLD, ROS,
NO, and the three positive edges between them. It does
not have any negative edges, so it cannot oscillate. A
fixed ABA value is sufficient to stabilize each node of
the cycle in a specific state, thus the cycle does not
admit multi-stability under any perturbation.
The C iSCC has three nodes, C i, mesophyll cell photo-
synthesis (MCPS), carbon fixation, and four edges that
form two negative feedback loops, one between carbon
fixation and C i, and the other between C iand MCPS.
Despite the existence of negative feedback, this cycle will
stabilize if given a fixed CO 2value. From this we know
that this cycle cannot oscillate or admit multi-stability
under any perturbation.
The Ion SCC has 13 nodes. To reduce its complexity
we show that the key node [Ca2+]c, which has states 0,1,
and 2, cannot enter state 2 in the long term under any
perturbation. Since most nodes respond to [Ca2+]conly
if [Ca2+]c=2, we can eliminate all edges that depend
only on “[Ca2+]c=2”, and obtain a simplified Ion SCC,
as shown in Fig. 3. The Ca2+SCC ([Ca2+]c,C a2+ATPase,
PLC, CaR) now becomes a sink SCC. The only negative
edge in this sub-network is from Ca2+-ATPase to [Ca2+]c.
These two nodes are known to oscillate. The positive feed-
back loop formed by [Ca2+]c, PLC, and CaR will stabilize if
given fixed inputs. So there cannot be multi-stability. For
the nodes outside of the Ca2+feedback loops, we show that
the edges from KEV and [K+]va r er e d u n d a n ti nt h el o n g
term, so there are no feedback loops except the PMV self-
loop. PMV is not capable of having oscillations, but can
have bistability (as also indicated by the stable motifanalysis). The bistability can affect at most one other node,
Kout, under any perturbation. This means that the bistability
has very limited effect on the attractor of the reduced
model.
Now we can summarize our conclusions and return to
the question we sought to answer: there is no oscillation
except in the calcium nodes; there is no multi-stability
except in the nodes PMV and K out. These statements are
true under any perturbation. Moreover, for the calcium
oscillation, [Ca2+]ccannot enter the state 2, so the sub-
network between [Ca2+]cand Ca2+-ATPase is a negative
feedback loop between two Boolean nodes, with the
regulatory functions Ca2+ATPase*= [Ca2+]c; [Ca2+]c*=
not Ca2+ATPase. It results in the simplest type of oscil-
lation, as also found by GINsim simulation. For the
PMV bistability, even if the bistability exists, most nodes,
especially the output node stomatal opening, still have a
unique value. Thus the theoretical analysis, in agreement
with the computational analysis, leads to very strong
conclusions about the reduced model ’s dynamic
repertoire.
We can also show that the reduction or Boolean con-
version did not change the attractors of the Sun et al.
model. Although the reduction we used is only proven
in the Boolean case, Naldi et al. showed that for multi-
valued models, removal of non-autoregulated nodes, like
in our reduction, preserves crucial dynamical properties
[35], including fixed point attractors and the two-node
simple oscillation we found. So our reduction is valid in
this specific model. To confirm that the Boolean conver-
sion preserved attractors, we note that in the Boolean-Table 4 Summary of the attractors found using the stable motif algorithm

The first five columns indicate the input signal combination. The setting CO 2_high = 1 and CO 2= 0 is not included because it is not biologically meaningful. The
“SO (Bool) ”column indicates the state of the Boolean node combination representing stomatal opening. The “SO ”column is the state of stomatal opening when
converted back to an integer. Note that the stomatal opening level of four is not defined, and no attractors have a stomatal opening level of two. The nex t
column indicates whether Ca2+oscillation can possibly happen under the given signal combination. The last column indicates whether bistability of PMV_pos can
be observed under this setting. In those cases, two stable steady states with (PMV_pos = 0, K out= 0) and (PMV_pos = 1, K out= 1) can be observed. The rest of the
nodes are unaffected by this two-node bistabilityGan and Albert BMC Systems Biology  (2016) 10:78 
converted reduced model we found fixed point attractors
and a complex attractor in which only two nodes oscil-
late. Because the only potential change to attractors as a
consequence of the conversion is merging of complex
attractors [26], it is straightforward that the attractors
have been conserved during the conversion, as the two-
node oscillation found is the simplest type of complex
attractor and cannot be a result of attractor merging. In
addition, using general asynchronous update instead of
random order asynchronous update does not cause any
changes to the attractor, because the update schemes do
not affect fixed points or the two-node simple oscillation
we found.
Stability of guard cell signal transduction
Our previous results indicate the stability of the system
in the sense that all the initial conditions lead to the
same attractor except for up to four nodes. We also
examine another facet of the system ’s stability: the ro-
bustness of the stomatal opening in response to node
perturbations that render them non-functional. We per-
form a systematic analysis of single-node knockouts of
every non-signal node in the reduced model, under all
combinations of light, CO 2and ABA conditions. For
each signal combination, we set the perturbed node ’s ini-
tial state and regulatory function to 0, initialize the restof the nodes in the condition representative of closed
stomata, and then simulate the reduced model until it
reaches its attractor. In the absence of ABA under each
light and CO 2condition, 60 –90 % perturbation scenarios
produce the same stomatal opening value as the unper-
turbed system (Table 5). These results are similar to
those reported by Sun et al. for the original model [15]
(see Additional file 9). In the presence of ABA 50 –90 %
perturbation scenarios produce the same stomatal open-
ing value as the unperturbed system, and 4 –16 % knock-
outs lead to a higher stomatal opening value.
Perturbations in the ABA = 1 case were not studied by
Sun et al., but our simulations of the original model give
the same qualitative results as the reduced model. These
results indicate the closeness of the perturbed attractor
(at least in terms of the stomatal opening value) to the
unperturbed attractor in more than 50 % of single node
perturbations. They also suggest the resilience of the sto-
matal opening process against internal failures and
perturbations.
Extending the conclusions to the original model
We found that in the reduced model there is no oscilla-
tion except in the calcium nodes; there is no multi-
stability except in the nodes PMV and K out. Because the
reduction we used has been shown to conserveFig. 3 The Ion SCC after reducing all edges that depend on calcium. All regulators of this sub-network have been omitted. On the left, [Ca2+]c
related nodes form a sink sub-networkGan and Albert BMC Systems Biology  (2016) 10:78 
attractors [23, 35], we know that our attractor conclu-
sions can be immediately extended to all nodes in the
original model except the reduced nodes and stomatal
opening. Next we extend the attractor analysis to include
the reduced nodes as well.
First we consider the nodes reduced during the first
step of network reduction, i.e. non-signal source nodes
and simple mediator nodes. These nodes are trivially in-
capable of having multi-stability and oscillations them-
selves, so we need only to consider their perturbations.
Perturbation of a simple mediator node can always be
replaced by a corresponding (set of) perturbation(s) in
the mediator node ’s direct successor(s), so these pertur-
bations have already been considered. Perturbing a non-
signal source node may theoretically cause a difference,
however the nodes in this category in the Sun et al.
model represent molecules that are abundant in the cell
or cell environment, thus their perturbation is not bio-
logically relevant or practical.
Next we consider the anion nodes reduced due to the
simplified stomatal opening rule. Recall that these nodes
do not affect other nodes except stomatal opening in the
long term. There cannot be multi-stability in anion
nodes unless the assumptions of sufficient initial [NO 3−]a
and starch concentration, and sufficient initial mito-
chondrial TCA cycle activity are violated (details are
provided in Additional file 3, section 5 and 6). Sincethere is no support for interventions that would lead to
the violation of these assumptions, it is reasonable to
conclude that no multi-stability can be found in the re-
duced nodes under biologically relevant situations. We
also found that there can be an additional oscillation in
the RIC7 path (involving the nodes ROP2, RIC7 and SO)
when a special set of perturbations is applied. Under that
case, the nodes RIC7 and SO will oscillate. Since the ef-
fect of this behavior is small (within 5 % of the unper-
turbed SO value in the Sun et al. model [15]), it has
little biological significance. There are no more possible
oscillations as there are no more negative feedback
loops. To conclude, the original Sun et al. model has os-
cillations only in cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]c) and Ca2+
ATPase, and has multi-stability only in PMV and K out,
under situations that are biologically meaningful.
Discussion
The conclusions we obtained can tell us how to control
this network model. Generally in engineering applica-
tions, control means to drive a system into an arbitrary
state [36, 37]. However in biological systems, it is more
meaningful to drive the system into one of its natural
attractors rather than into an arbitrary state, as the
attractors correspond to stable phenotypes [38]. To con-
trol the attractor of a Boolean system, one needs to con-
trol only its input nodes and a subset of nodes in eachTable 5 Summary of systematic perturbation results

stable motif [39]. Our integrated analysis, involving
Boolean conversion, indicates that to control the at-
tractor that the stomatal opening network evolves into,
one only needs to control the input signals and PMV,
even in case of perturbations. In particular, to control
the stomatal opening value, one only needs to control
the input signals, under any perturbation.
The reduced model provides new biological insights.
Normally, when ABA is present, stomata will close.
However in some knockout mutants stomata can
open to a certain extent in the presence of ABA, al-
though the opening level is not as much as in the
case without ABA [15]. Such partial reversals of the
effect of ABA are important for understanding the
mechanism of stomatal opening. For example, Sun et
al. reported that OST1 knockout (OST1 is kept 0)
and inhibition of the NADPH oxidase (AtrbohD/F is
kept 0) yielded partially restored SO level in simula-
tions, in agreement with experimental observations
(see Additional file 2 for the comparison of the
equivalent simulations in the reduced model with
experiments). Simplification of the Sun et al. model
allows easier simulation of more perturbation scenar-
ios, e.g. the systematic identification of possible par-
tial reversals. Table 6 indicates all the partial reversals
d u et os i n g l en o d ek n o c k o u t si nt h er e d u c e dm o d e l .
Our results reproduce the observation that knockout
of nodes in the ABA pathway (PLD, NO, ROS) can cause
partial reversals of ABA ’s effect. We find that AnionCh
knockout can partially restore stomatal opening inhib-
ited by ABA, a result not reported by Sun et al., but
which is supported by experimental evidence [40]. In
addition, Table 6 offers a new biological prediction: low
CO 2concentration can partially restore stomatal open-
ing when ABA is present. This is consistent with the
knowledge that CO 2-free air promotes stomatal opening
in the absence of ABA [41]. This CO 2effect suggests a
mechanism of cross-talk between CO 2and ABA. Im-
portantly, apart from the five nodes listed in Table 6, no
other node ’s knockout can reverse ABA ’s inhibition of
stomatal opening. The perturbation results of Table 5
offer many more new predictions.
Our combination of techniques offers a powerful frame-
work for determining the dynamic repertoire of a multi-level dynamic model. Multi-level models are more accur-
ate than Boolean models in describing the quantitative
characteristics of dynamic systems, but there are few gen-
eral methods to analyze multi-level models [10, 12]. By
combining different existing methods, we were able to
overcome the limitations of each method. Our successful
combination of existing methods offers a promising way
to analyze multi-level models, and might point towards a
general strategy to analyze the attractors of multi-level
models, biological or non-biological.
A notable future direction for this work is to develop
an alternative way to determine the attractors of multi-
level models by extending the concept of stable motifs.
Compared with conversion to a Boolean model, then ap-
plying Boolean stable motif algorithm, extending the
stable motif algorithm to multi-level models can avoid
potential attractor change issues. Development of such a
technique will allow easy and powerful attractor analysis
for multi-level models.
Conclusions
We obtained a very strong conclusion about the attrac-
tors of the Sun et al. stomatal opening model: under any
combination of sustained signals, all nodes in the model
converge into steady states, with the potential exception
of the cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]c)a n dC a2+ATPase. Varia-
tions in the initial condition of non-source nodes or in
process timing (node update sequence) can drive at most
two nodes, PMV and K out, into a different attractor. This
high degree of attractor similarity is somewhat unex-
pected, as the network has a large strongly connected
component and several feedback loops. Thus, despite the
decidedly non-linear structure of the network, most parts
of the system behave in the consistent manner of a linear
pathway. This is a distinct feature of the stomatal opening
model: many dynamic models of biological systems have
multiple, diverse attractors [22, 42]. The models of these
systems will evolve into drastically different attractors
when starting from different initial conditions, sometimes
even when starting from the same initial condition, dem-
onstrating different biological trajectories. In the stomatal
opening model, however, the uniqueness of the steady
state stomatal opening level suggests that the final extent
of the stomatal opening response is robust and resilient

knockout means CO 2being set to zero (CO 2free air). No entry means the setting does not cause partial reversalGan and Albert BMC Systems Biology  (2016) 10:78paper_8	Output: <<<<<<<Grb2 = ( EGFR_Y1068 )  OR ( EGFR_Y1086 )  OR ( ErbB2_Y1139 )  OR ( Src AND ( ( ( Fak ) ) )    )  OR ( Shc )

Background
Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous male
malignancy and one of the leading causes of cancer mor-tality in the western world [1]. The growth and pro-
gression of prostate cancer is stimulated by androgens
[2]. Androgens are male sex steroid hormones that areresponsible for the development of male characteristics.
Testosteroneisthemostimportantandrogeninmen.The
effects of androgens are mediated through the androgenreceptor (AR) [3]. The androgen receptor is a nuclear

University,CollegeStation,TX,USAreceptor, which is activated in response to the bindingof androgens. Upon activation, it mediates transcription
of target genes that modulate growth and differentia-
tion of prostate epithelial cells. In malignant prostatecells, androgen signaling is deregulated and the homeo-
static balance between the rate of cell proliferation and
programmed cell death is lost. As prostate cancer relies
on androgens for growth, the main line of treatment
focuses on abrogating the action of androgens. Andro-gen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the form of surgical
or medical castration is the cornerstone of treatment for
prostate cancer [4]. Initially, androgen ablation inducessignificantregressionofthetumor.However,theresponse
to ADT is temporary and prostate cancer invariably
stops responding to this treatment regimen, leading to a

clinical condition that is known as hormone-refractory
prostatecancer,androgen-independentprostatecanceror
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is a
more aggressive and typically lethal phenotype where thetumor continues to grow in spite of the very low levels
(<50 ng/ml) of circulating serum testosterone. Standard
treatment options are limited and palliative docetaxel-based chemotherapy is generally used for patients who
have become refractory to hormone treatment. How-
ever,mediansurvivaltimeforpatientsfollowingfirst-linechemotherapeutic treatment is just eighteen to twenty-
four months [5]. There is therefore a clear rationale for
advancesinalternativetherapeuticsinordertoevolveandexpand the landscape of treatment options for malignant
formsofprostatecancerthatrecurafterabatement.
Over recent years, there has been a significant effort
towards furthering our understanding of the molecularmechanisms underpinning tumor development, growth
and progression. It is now appreciated that in spite of
castrate levels of androgens, the cancer cells are able to
maintain persistent androgen receptor signaling througha variety of contributory mechanisms including AR gene
amplification that results in overexpression of AR, gain-
of-function mutations in AR which enable promiscuousactivation of the receptor through other steroids or even
in the absence of ligand binding, changes in AR co-
activators and the expression of AR splice variants [6].This compensatory response allows cancer cells to sur-
viveinalowtestosteroneenvironmentandthereactivated
AR signaling axis continues to play a role after neo-plastic transformation. Additionally, certain androgen-
independent cellular signaling pathways that promote
proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, have been criticallyimplicatedasdriversofcontinuedprogressionofprostate
cancer. Hence, accumulating evidence indicates that the
growth and progression of prostate cancer is a compli-
cated process that involves interaction between multiple
pathways. Advances in our knowledge of the biology ofprostate cancer has led to the development of a number
of novel therapies designed to target signaling pathways
involvedindiseaseprogression.Withtheexceptionofcer-tainandrogensynthesisandARsignalingantagoniststhat
have received regulatory approval, these advanced agents
areundervariousstagesofclinicaltrials[7].
Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a complex mal-
ady. Given the inherent complexity of the CRPC signal-ing cascade, there is no one dominant molecular driveracross all tumors and hence no single drug can act as
a “magic bullet” by being uniformly effective for treat-
ing the malignancy [8, 9]. At best, limited benefit will bederived from targeting a single molecule. Rational com-
binations of signal-modulating therapeutic agents have
higherlikelihoodofyieldingbetteroutcomes.Whilethere
are several drugs being tested on cell lines, most of thesestudies focus on a single pharmaceutical agent and very
few of those experiments involve trying out drug com-
binations. Furthermore, prostate cancer is a markedly
heterogeneous disease, with different tumors varying intheir composition and makeup. In other words, different
tumorswillharbordifferentmalfunctionsinthesignaling
pathways.Thus,tailoredtargetedtherapiesbasedonindi-vidualtumorcharacteristicsarerequiredtomaximizethe

Mathematical and computational modeling plays a piv-
otal role in systems biology in elucidating biologicalinsightsfromlarge-scalebiomolecularsignalingnetworks
that are not amenable to straightforward intuitive inter-pretation. A diverse array of formalisms have been pro-
posed in this domain as suitable representations for
complex multicomponent networks such as cellularsignaling pathways [10]. Amongst these frameworks,
Boolean network models [11, 12] have emerged as
an extremely useful parameter-free approach to cap-
ture the qualitative behavior of extensive genetic net-

Prostatecancersignaltransductionnetwork
Cellular processes such as growth and division are regu-lated byaninterconnected network ofmoleculesreferred
to as signaling pathways. Key cellular signal transduc-tion pathways known to play a major role in cell survival,
growth,differentiationandthedevelopmentofcastration-
resistance in prostate cancer are the Androgen Recep-
tor (AR), PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Mitogen-Activated
Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways. The aberrant behaviorof prostate cancer cells is characterized by dysfunction in
these selective oncogenic signaling pathways promoting
malignant characteristics. Thesepathways play a role in adiverse range of essential physiological cellular processes
such as differentiation, survival, proliferation, protein
synthesis and metabolism. Malfunctions in these path-ways are common in prostate cancer malignancies. For
example,approximately70%ofadvancedprostatecancers

Booleanmodelingofprostatecancersignaling
Inthecontextofmethodologiesthatareappliedtomodelcellular signal transduction networks, Boolean networksare probably the simplest where the state of each node
in the network is either active (on) or inactive (off). In a
Boolean network, the nodes are the genes and the edgesrepresent the interaction amongst the genes. Since the
molecules in a gene-regulatory-network (GRN) exhibit
switch-like behavior, genes may be regarded as binarydevices where a gene can be considered to be active if it
is being transcribed and inactive if it is not. Moreover,
the relationships amongst the genes may be representedby means of logical functions. Thus, a GRN is amenableto such a representation. The Boolean formalism is anal-ogous to a digital circuit where logic gates can be used to
represent the regulatory relationships amongst the nodes
andtheactivationlevelofthenodesisindicatedbybinarylogic. The biological interactions amongst the various
nodes (genes) represented in the gene regulatory net-
workofFig.1canthereforebetranslatedtoanequivalentBoolean circuit [25]. Let’s say either gene X or Y can acti-
vate a third gene Z, then we can model this component
ofthesignalingnetworkwithanORgatewithtwoinputs,namely X and Y and with output Z. Thus, the signaling
networkofFig.1canbemappedtothecombinationalcir-
cuit shown in Fig. 2. This digital logic circuit representsour multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems model of
theprostatecancersignalingtransductionnetwork.

of other signal values in the circuit. A stuck-at-fault can

should produce a non-proliferative output characterizedby the all-zero vector. However, faults in the network will
produce a non-zero (proliferative) output even when the
input is non-proliferative. The objective is to drive thefaulty network’s output as close as possible to that of the
fault-free circuit i.e. towards the all-zero vector through

tor [0010010] represents the combination of AZD6244
and Temsirolimus. Since, the total number of drugs is
seven, the number of possible drug combinations is 128.The objective is to determine the best possible therapy
for each fault. Each fault represents a different molecular

selection that can rectify the fault i.e. change the faultyoutput to the correct output. If that is not possible, thebest drug vector will drive the output as close as pos-
sible to the fault-free output. A simple metric that can
be used as a distance measure to determine how far theoutput vector is from the fault-free vector is Hamming
distance. Faults that produce an output vector with a
greater Hamming distance from the correct output have
more of the proliferative genes active and presumably a
greater proliferative effect. Since the correct output is theall-zerovector,theHammingdistanceoftheoutputvector
fromthecorrectoutputissimplytheHammingweightof
the output vector (for binary vectors Hamming weight isequivalent to the L

the output under every possible drug vector. The besttherapy for that fault is the drug vector that produces theoutput with the smallest Hamming weight. In addition,
since the drugs have deleterious side-effects, we would

cancer-inducing faults is the one that under the presence
of the fault, produces the best output with the smallestHammingweightwiththeminimalnumberofdrugs.

Nodevulnerabilityassessment
Inelectroniccircuits,reliabilityreferstotheprobabilityof
a circuit functioning as intended i.e. producing the cor-
rect output. Reliability assessment is used to determine
the vulnerability of a circuit to faults. A number of differ-ent techniques have been proposed for reliability analysis
in digital circuits [28]. Recently, in [29] a scalable, effi-
cient and accurate simulation-based framework based onstochastic computations was introduced for logic circuit
reliability evaluation. In biological systems, dysfunctions
in nodes in the signaling network cause deviation from
normativebehavior.Reliabilityassessmentmethodologies
canbeleveragedonBooleannetworkmodelsofpathwaysto determine the vulnerability of the network to the dys-
functionofeachnode[30,31].Inthissectionweconducta
stochasticlogicbasedvulnerabilityanalysisoftheprostatecancer signal transduction network in order to discoverthe most vulnerable nodes thereby allowing us to priori-tizesuchsegmentsinthenetworkwhoseperturbationhas
thegreatestpotentialtoyieldthemostclinicalbenefit.
In stochastic logic, signal probabilities are encoded in
randombinarybitstreams(thesignalprobabilityofanodecorresponds to the likelihood of that node having logic
valueone).Forexample,thebinarysequence0110010100oflengthtenencodestheprobability0.4sincethepropor-
tion of ones in this sequence is
4
10. In practice, the length
of the stochastic sequences typically used is much larger.
Since the biological literature is devoid of precise lig-
and binding probabilities, each primary input is assumed
equally likely to be 0 or 1 i.e. all primary input signalprobabilitiesaretakentobe0.5.
StochasticlogicoftenmakesuseofBernoullisequences
for the random binary streams where each bit in thestream is generated independently from a Bernoulli ran-
domvariablewithaprobabilityofoneequalto p.T heuse
of probabilistic sequences inevitably introduces stochas-tic fluctuations which implies that the result produced
is non-deterministic. These fluctuations can be signifi-cantly reduced by representing the initial input proba-
bilities by non-Bernoulli sequences [32] defined as ran-
dom permutations of sequences containing a fixed num-ber of ones and zeros. For a given probability pand
sequence length L, a non-Bernoulli sequence contains a
fixed number pLof ones, with the positions of the ones
determined by a random permutation. Thus, for exam-
ple, to represent the probability 0.5 by a non-Bernoulli
stream of length 10, we could randomly permute thesequence 1111100000 which has five ones (instead of
generating each bit from a Bernoulli random variable
withp=0.5 as would have been done to represent
the same probability by a Bernoulli sequence). We use
non-Bernoullisequencesofrandompermutationsoffixed
number of ones and zeros in order to encode the initial
inputprobabilities.
A logic circuit operating on stochastic bit streams
(see Fig. 4 for an example), accepts as input randomsequencesrepresentingtheprobabilityofeachinputbeing
one and produces ones and zeros like any digital circuit[33] i.e. a stochastic logic circuit uses Boolean gates to
operate on sequences of random bits. Each bit-stream
represents a stochastic number interpreted as the proba-bility of seeing a one in an arbitrary position. Thus, the
computations performed by such a circuit are probabilis-
tic in nature. The output bit stream produced can bedecoded as the probability of the output being one by
countingthenumberofonesinthestreamanddividingby
itslength.
The vulnerability of a node is defined as the proba-
bility that the system produces incorrect output if thatparticularnodeisdysfunctional(faulty)i.e.itistheproba-

The procedure to determine the node vulnerabilities is
illustrated in Fig. 5 is as follows. We generate non-
Bernoulli sequences of length L=1,000,000 in whichexactly half of the bits are set to one at each of the seven
initial inputs. The input stochastic sequences are propa-
gated through both the original error-free circuit and thecircuit in which the node of interest is dysfunctional. As
discussed in the previous section, the dysfunction of a
node is represented by a corresponding stuck-at fault oftherequisitetypeattheparticularlocation.Thisproduces
two sets of stochastic bit streams, one at each of the pri-
mary outputs of the fault-free circuit and the other at theprimary outputs of the unreliable circuit. The proportion
ofonesintheoutputbitstreamencodestheoutputsignal
probabilities i.e. the probability of the output being one.Since the reliability of the circuit under the fault is the
probability that the circuit output is same as that of the
fault-free circuit, the sequence encoding the output reli-
ability can be obtained from the output sequence of the
faultycircuitbycomparingittotheoutputsequenceofthefault-free circuit andsettingeachbitto onewheneverthe
correspondingbitsinthesequencesarethesameandzeroiftheyaredifferent.Theproportionofonesinthisresult-
ing sequence will then correspond to the reliability of
that output. Thus, we can obtain the stochastic sequence
representing the reliability of each output by taking theXOR of each output bit stream of the faulty circuit with
the complement of the corresponding output bitstreams
of the fault-free circuit. For a circuit with multiple pri-mary outputs as is the case here, the stochastic sequence
encoding the joint output reliability can be obtained by
taking the stochastic AND of the outputs of the XORgates as the stochastic AND operation on the output of
XOR gates produces a one only if all the corresponding
bits at each XOR gate are one i.e. if all the correspond-ing bits in the respective outputs of the fault-free and
faulty circuit are same. We then take the complement of
the bit stream at the output of this AND gate to obtainthestreamthatencodesvulnerability.Thisbitstreamcan
thenbedecodedtodeterminethenodevulnerabilitywith
the proportion of ones in this stream equivalent to the
vulnerabilityofthenode.

Thus, there are many locations in the gene regulatory

are tailored specifically to the molecular abnormalities incritical pathways and thereby facilitates an individualized
approachtotherapydesign.
In order to find the best combination therapy across
all possible faults, as discussed in the methods section,
for each drug combination we determine the sum of theHamming weights of the output vector across all pos-
sible combinations of faults and choose the drug com-
bination that yields the smallest total. This gives us thedrug cocktail of AZD6244, AZD5363 and Enzalutamide

as a combination therapy for advanced prostate cancer.
In a recent study, the drug combination of AZD5363 and
Enzalutamide has demonstrated an impressive response
in prostate cancer models [34]. Moreover, AZD6244 inpartnership with an AKT pathway inhibitor (analogous
to AZD5363), has been proposed as a strategy for the
treatment of CRPC [35]. Thus, we propose that theaforementioned drug triad which represents a horizon-
tal blockade approach, wherein combination therapy is
used for the concerted pharmacologic inhibition of mul-tiple compensatory pathways, as a therapeutic modality
thatmayattenuateprostatecancersurvivalandgrowth.

Using the framework delineated in the methods section,
we quantify the vulnerability of different nodes. The vul-
nerability values obtained are given in Table 2. Vulnera-
bility assessment can be used to identify candidates fortargeted drug development. Nodes whose vulnerabilities
are higher should be presumably better targets for drugs
since potentially therapeutic benefit is more likely fornodes which are more vulnerable. We observe that the

values so drugs that attempt to alleviate these aberra-tions should be efficacious in attenuating tumor growth.
Thedesignofanti-cancertherapeuticsdirectedattheloss
of tumor suppressors has been difficult [36]. Addition-ally, AKT-selective drug development is challenging due
to its homology with other kinases [37]. These complica-
tions notwithstanding, accelerated development of novelagents that target these aberrations is warranted. In con-
trast,thevulnerabilitiesforcertainnodessuchasthosein
the mTOR axis are low indicating that they might not beattractive targets for drug development. Indeed, marginal
clinical activity has been observed for mTOR inhibition

Conclusion
Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a hormone refrac-
tory phenotype of significant morbidity and mortality in
the prostate cancer disease continuum where patientsno longer respond to androgen ablation therapy. The
biomolecular network representing the signaling path-
ways involved in the pathogenesis of this lethal malig-
nancy is translated to a digital circuit. The locations of
possible malfunctions in the digital circuit are identifiedand computer simulation of the equivalent model is used
to predict effective therapies that mitigate the effect of
different faults. A prospectively attractive combinatorialtherapeuticstrategyfortheconstellationofabnormalities
is to leverage an AR axis targeted agent in conjunction
with reciprocal inhibitors of other dysregulated pathwaysthat are fundamental in coordinately driving oncogene-
sis. Proof of principle of clinical use for the proposed
regimenremainstobedemonstrated.Areliability(vulner-ability) analysis methodology of digital circuits premised
onstochasticlogicmodelingisutilizedtoquantifythevul-
nerability of the network to the dysfunction in discretecomponents in the signaling cascade thereby identifying
key variables as targets for intervention that conceivably
might be exploited by a new generation of novel thera-peutics.Thesefindingscancontributetothedevelopment
of new rational approaches for the possible treatment of
androgen-refractory prostate cancer. There is however a
paucity of companion predictive biomarkers that can be
used for the stratification of patients based on molecularaberrations in order to prescribe the apposite treatment.

Abstract
Cells andtissues areexposed tostress from numerous sources. Senescence isaprotective
mechanism thatprevents malignant tissue changes andconstitutes afundamental mecha-

(SASP) thatcauses chronic inflammation. Wepresent aBoolean network model-based
gene regulatory network oftheSASP, incorporating published gene interaction data. The
simulation results describe current biological knowledge. The model predicts different in-sili-
coknockouts thatprevent keySASP-mediat ors,IL-6 andIL-8, from getting activated upon
DNA damage. The NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO) was themost promising in-silico
knockout candidate andwewere able toshow itsimportance intheinhibition ofIL-6 and
IL-8 following DNA-dama geinmurine dermal fibroblasts in-vitro. Westrengthen thespecu-

Introduction
Age-related diseases canbeheld accountable forthemajor part ofmorbidity andmortality inan
ageing population. Additionally they cause alarge proportion ofyearly health costs [1].Cellular
senescence isoneofthemost prominent events that islikely tocontribute toageing. Itrefers to
theirreversible cellcycle arrest that isessential when cells encounter detrimental changes. Once
inpermanent arrest, these cells arenormally cleared bytheimmune system before they areable
todoanyharm totheorganism [2].However, some ofthese cells persist anddevelop asecretory
phenotype releasing avariety offactors among which pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines
andextracellular matrix degrading proteases areincluded. Together these shape thesenescent-
associated secretory phenotype orSASP [3±5].
While theSASP cancause chronic inflammation intissue, itcanalso reinforce senescence
inautocrine and paracrine manner [6,7].This feature oftheSASP notonly keeps senescent
cells intheir growth arrested states butitpromotes senescence spreading tohealthy bystander
cells. Therefore, theSASP contributes totheaccumulation ofsenescent cells during ageing,
butalso supports theemergence ofage-related chronic diseases and tissue dysfunctions by
elevating inflammatory processes [6,8].Major soluble factors that facilitate thisbystander-
infection ofhealthy cells areIL-6 and IL-8. Both have been shown tobeimportant inthemain-
tenance and spreading ofoncogene- and DNA-damage-induc edsenescence [3].Also, both
have been shown tobehighly overexpressed bysenescent cells and areknown tolocally and
systemically play important roles intheregulations ofavariety ofprocesses intheaging body
[3,4,9].IL-6, infact, most likely contributes toorgan dysfunction during aging thus promot-
ingfrailty [8].
Toallow foradeeper understanding oftheSASP and thedynamics ofitscomplex interac-
tions acomputational model oftheRegulatory Network (RN) [10] and subsequent simulations
canbeinsightful. RNs canbedescribed bydifferent mathematical models such asdifferential
equations, Bayesian networks, and Boolean networks among others [11]. The Boolean network
model [12, 13], asopposed toother model approaches, canbebased onqualitative knowledge
only. Ingene-gene interaction, forexample, theexpression ofagene isregulated bytranscrip-
tion factors binding toitsregulatory regions. The activation ofagene follows aswitch-like
behavior depending ontheconcentration ofitstranscription factors. This behavior allows
common approximation ofthepossible states ofagene tobeactive orinactive [14, 15]. Ulti-
mately, thiscanbeencoded asBoolean logical values: true (ª1º) orfalse (ª0º). The interactions
between genes, e.g.whether afactor acts asanactivator, repressor orboth canbedescribed by
functions. These Boolean functions arethebasis tosimulate dynamic behavior, i.e.changes
over time. Asevery regulatory factor hastwopossible states (active orinactive) inaBoolean
network model, 2xpossible state combinations (i.e.gene activation patterns) exist forxgenes.

Competing interests :Theauthors have declared
thatnocompeting interests exist.
Foranyactivation pattern, iterative updates ofgenes inthenetwork through consecutive appli-
cation oftheBoolean rules eventually lead tosequences ofgene activation patterns that are
time-invariant, called attractors. These attractors cancorrespond toobserved expression pro-
files ofbiological phenotypes orcanbeused tocreate hypotheses tofurther evaluate inwet-lab
experiments [16, 17]. Different update strategies fortheBoolean functions exist. Using asyn-
chronous update strategy means applying allBoolean functions simultaneously, also assuming
that regulatory factors interact independently ofoneanother and that their interaction hasa
similar time scale resolution. Relaxing these assumptions leads totheconcept ofasynchronous
updates where each Boolean function ofisupdated separately oneatatime inanyorder. This
allows amore direct modelling ofdifferent time scales. The asynchronous update strategy also
usually generates trajectories that aredifferent from those ofsynchronous Boolean networks.
The state transition graph ofanasynchronous Boolean network becomes aMarkov chain
which requires theadditional definition oftransition probabilities ineach node ofthestate
graph. Interestingly, point attractors (those with onestate) inasynchronous Boolean networks
arethesame asthose insynchronous Boolean networks. However, these networks canalso
show loose/complex attractors [18] which arepart ofactive research [19, 20]. Another exten-
sion ofBoolean networks areprobabilistic Boolean networks, which may define more than
oneBoolean function forregulatory factors where each function hasaspecific probability to
bechosen forupdate. Although thisconcept may closer represent abiological system, itagain
requires parameter estimation fortheprobabilities. However, estimation oftheprobabilities
naturally demands large amounts ofinteraction specific data which is,forlarger networks, nei-
ther economically, norexperimentally viable. Inourcase, wedecided tofocus onsynchronous
Boolean networks, partly duetotheir proven usability, and their ability toreveal keydynamical
patterns ofthemodelled system. However, tostrengthen ourmodels' hypothesis, weaddition-
allyperformed in-silico experiments with anasynchronous update scheme (S1Text).
Synchronous Boolean networks have been used tomodel theoncogenic pathways inneuro-
blastoma [21], thehrpregulon ofPseudomonas syringae [22], theblood development from
mesoderm toblood [23], thedetermination ofthefirst orsecond heart field identity [24] as
well asforthemodeling oftheWnt pathway [25]. The qualitative knowledge base that isneces-
sary toreconstruct [26] aBoolean network model consists mostly ofreports onspecific inter-
actions that describe local regulation ofgenes orproteins. Boolean network models utilize this
knowledge about local regulations toreconstruct afirst global mechanistic model ofSASP. In
summary, such amodel allows togenerate hypotheses about regulatory influences ondifferent
local interactions. These interactions, inturn, canbetested inwet-lab inorder tovalidate the
generated hypothesis and assess theaccuracy oftheproposed model.
Here, wepresent aregulatory Boolean network ofthedevelopment and maintenance of
senescence and theSASP incorporating published gene interaction data ofSASP-associated
signaling pathways likeIL-1, IL-6, p53and NF-κB. Wesimulated themodel and retrieved
steady states ofpathway interactions between p53/p16INK4Asteered senescence, IL-1/IL-6
driven inflammatory activity and theemergence and retention oftheSASP through NF-κB
and itstargets. This Boolean network enables thehighlighting ofkeyplayers inthese processes.
Simulations ofknock-out experiments within thismodel goinlinewith previously published
data. The subsequent validation ofgenerated in-silico resultsin-tireo wasdone inmurine der-
mal fibroblasts (MDF) isolated from amurine NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO)-knockout
system inwhich DNA damage wasintroduced. The NEMO knockout inhibits IL-6 and IL-8
homologue mRNA expression and protein secretion inMDFs after DNA damagein-tireo,
possibly enabling atleast alowering ofthecontagiousness forneighboring cells and thepro-
tumorigenic potential oftheSASP. The model presented inthisarticle allows amechanistic

Results
The network model exhibits stable states forcellcycle progression and
senescence
The reconstruction ofaBoolean network model forSASP requires screening formany candi-
date interactions inpublished literature and data. Although themodel, after reconstruction,
may bereduced inthenumber ofcomponents [20, 27,28], itwould potentially hide some of
theinteraction targets and regulatory factors with regard tothesignaling cascade. The regula-
tory factors defined inthismodel arebeneficial ifonewants toextend themodel and include
additional related signaling pathways. The subsequent model must accurately correspond to
thecurrent understanding oftheprocess athand, i.e.,able topredict well-known phenotypes
ofSASP. Biological phenotypes represent along-term behavior ofabiological system based on
interaction ofregulatory factors. Inthesame sense, attractors arethelong-term behavior ofa
Boolean network model based ontheBoolean rules ofmodelled regulatory factors. Hence,
there isanatural correspondence between biological phenotypes and attractors intheBoolean
network. Inthefollowing, weusefigures that depict thesignaling cascade towards anattractor
aswell astheattractor itself. The interpretation ofthese attractors inthecontext ofSASP fur-
ther allows generation ofhypotheses that canbetested inabiological system.
The information forthereconstruction ofthese networks wascollected from published
data. Anoverview ofthegenes incorporated inthismodel and their interaction canbefound
inFig1.The corresponding Boolean rules arelisted inTable 1.The network depicts processes
following acellcycle arrest inducing action, such asDNA damage and other cellular stresses.
Here, weanalyze SASP under strong DNA damage and donotdistinguish between different
levels ofDNA damage.
Wefirst analyzed ifourmodel canrender steady states forcellcycle progression when there
isnostress signal input. Our data show anormal cellcycle progression with active CDK2 and
CDK4, aswell asphosphorylated Rband hence anactive E2F. Noother signaling pathways
that areimplemented inthismodel were activated which canbeseen asnormal cellcycle pro-
gression (Fig 2).
Upon theoutside signal DNA damage, weobserve first theactivation oftheDNA damage
response with asubsequent activation ofp53andp16INK4Asignaling, leading toastop incell
cycle progression andatalater time point topermanent cellcycle arrest. Simultaneously NF-κB
signaling gets activated bytheDNA damage response through NEMO, giving risetobeneficial
butalso detrimental effects ofNF-κB likethesenescence associated secretory phenotype (Fig 3).
After entering p53/p21 and p16INK4Amediated permanent cellcycle arrest upon DNA
damage, theactivation ofNF-κB leads toanincrease ofIL-1, IL-6 aswell asIL-8 expression
among others [29±33]. Our model shows thedirect activation ofthese cytokines and chemo-
kines byNF-κB after itsactivation through theDNA damage response and NEMO (Fig 3).
The Boolean network describes published knock-out and
overexpression phenotypes
The NF-κB pathway hasbeen studied extensively and there areknockout mice available forall
proteins ofthepathway, however some ofthem areembryonically lethal duetotheimportance

ofNF-κB signaling inregulating development and apoptosis. Wetherefore focused onpub-
lishedin-tireo knockout and overexpression phenotypes. IL-6 and IL-8 areextremely impor-
tant inmaintaining and spreading theSASP inanautocrine aswell asparacrine fashion.
Hence, wefollowed thequestion what knockouts and/or overexpressions theBoolean network
model suggests toinhibit theexpression ofIL-6 and IL-8 under theassumption ofexisting
DNA damage. These simulations areincluded inS1Text.

RelA binds with p50toform atranscriptionally active heterodimer (called NFkB inthis
model). Initsinactive state, itisbound with theinhibitor ofkappa B(IκB) and resides inthe
cytoplasm. Upon NF-κB activation, theinhibitor isphosphorylated bytheinhibitor ofkappa B
kinases (IKK) and degraded which releases theRelA/p50 heterodimer totranslocate tothe
nucleus and regulate thetranscription oftarget genes. Toinvestigate therole ofRelA onthe
expression ofIL-8, wesetNFkB =0,simulating theablation ofthetranscriptionally active het-
erodimer (Fig 4).The predictions ofthemodel simulations areconsistent with knock-out
experiments where theabsence ofRelA caused asignificant reduction inIL-8 production in
human fibroblast (IMR-90) [7].
Wealso simulated theoverexpression ofIκBbyconstantly activating IκB(IkB =1)and
could show aneffect comparable totheknock-out ofRelA (Fig 5).Inourmodel theoverex-
pression ofIκBleads totheinhibition ofIL-8 and IL-6 expression which isinlinewith aprevi-

NEMO isessential forDNA damage triggered NF-κB activation
Apart from being important fortheassembly oftheIKK-complex, NEMO also acts asashuttle
relaying theATM-mediated DNA damage apparatus tocellular response mechanisms. Upon
DNA damage ATM canbind NEMO and trigger itstranslocation from thenucleus tothecyto-
plasm where itactivates NF-κB signaling [36]. This inturn willhelp cells avoid clearance
through apoptosis, increasing thenumber oflong-term senescent cells intissues and organs of
theorganism and might also increase and sustain theinflammatory potential oftheSASP.
Inorder toevaluate proposed knockouts NEMO wasdepleted from murine dermal fibro-
blasts (MDFs) using aNEMO-floxed mouse line. These MDFs were isolated from murine skin
and subsequently transfected with aCre-recombinase coding plasmid including afluorescence
reporter construct (Fig 7).Topurify NEMO knockout MDFs, these cells were FACS sorted
twodays post-transfection (S1A Fig). Successful NEMO knockout wasassessed byPCR (S1B
Fig) and western blot (S1C Fig). Tostudy theeffect ofDNA damage, overnight-starved MDFs
were treated with 25μMetoposide, anestablished DNA damage and senescence inducer, for3
hfollowed bya24hincubation period [37]. Afterwards cellmedia supernatant wastaken and
total RNA wasisolated. Wefirst measured p21mRNA expression asanindicator forDNA
damage and cellcycle arrest. Without asignificant reduction ofcellviability (Fig 8A), p21
mRNA expression wasupregulated more than twofold inetoposide treated compared to
untreated MDFs (Fig 8B). NEMO isofhigh importance forDNA damage mediated nuclear
translocation oftheNF-κB signaling molecule p65. Asshown byimmunofluorescence staining
ofuntreated NEMO wildtype MDFs compared toetoposide treated wildtype and knockout
MDFs, thetranslocation ofp65into thenucleus upon DNA damage issignificantly increased
inwildtype whereas itisbrought down tothelevel ofuntreated wildtype MDFs when NEMO
isknocked out(Fig 8C).
NEMO mediates DNA damage induced expression andsecretion ofIL-6
andIL-8
Aswehave observed theeffect ofaNEMO knockout onthenuclear translocation ofp65and
thereby activation ofNF-κB, wefurther explored thepossible suppressive effect onIL-6 and
IL-8 activation. Toachieve thisweisolated total RNA and analyzed themRNA expression of
IL-6 and themurine homologues ofIL-8 CXCL1 (KC), CXCL2 (MIP-2) and CXCL5 (LIX).
Upon DNA damage, weobserved asignificant reduction inIL-6 mRNA expression with a
strong downregulation inuntreated knockout compared tountreated wildtype. Aneven stron-
gerdownregulation inetoposide treated NEMO knockout compared towildtype MDFs was
detected. Taken together aNEMO knockout could reduce DNA-damage mediated IL-6
mRNA expression byalmost tenfold (Fig 9A). Next, wemeasured thesecretion ofIL-6. While
there isnearly nosecretion ofIL-6 inuntreated wildtype aswell asknockout MDFs, astrong
increase inIL-6 secretion occurred inetoposide treated wildtype MDFs, whereas theNEMO
knockout MDFs only shows asmall increase insecretion with amore than hundredfold reduc-
tion when compared with etoposide treated wildtype cells (Fig 9B). Weadditionally analyzed
themRNA expression ofthree murine IL-8 homologues toassess theimpact ofaNEMO

homologues were significantly downregulated inNEMO knockout MDFs compared towild-
type MDFs after DNA damage. The total expression ofIL-8 homologues mRNA inNEMO
knockout MDFs wasreduced byatleast fivefold when compared totreated wildtype MDFs
(Fig 9C). There isdetectable secretion ofIL-8 homologues inuntreated wildtype and NEMO
knockout MDFs, however thesecretion strongly rose upon etoposide treated inwildtype cells
whereas there isnodetectable increase intheNEMO knockout MDFs. This effect wassimilarly
found forthestudied IL-8 homologues KCand MIP-2 (Fig 9D). However, wedidnotfind any
significant alteration intheexpression oftwohousekeeping genes, such asbeta-actin and 18s
rRNA intheNEMO knockout MDFs, compared with NEMO wildtype (S2A Fig). Inaddition,
wealso didnotobserve anysignificant alteration intheexpression ofawide array ofgenes
that were predicted byBoolean network nottobechanged after NEMO knockout (S2B Fig).
These data show theimportance ofNEMO and NF-κB signaling fortheactivation ofIL-6 and
IL-8 inthecase ofDNA damage. Inearly stages DNA damaged and cellcycle arrested MDFs
most likely activate secretory SASP signaling through NF-κB rather than other stress
pathways.
Discussion
Inthemodel ofDNA damage and proinflammatory signaling presented here wecollected and
combined previously published knowledge onmajor regulators oftheSASP. Using thismodel,
weidentified attractors fitting cellcycle progression and cellcycle arrest asthey physiologically
occur. This suggests reliability ofthismodel interms ofreproducibility ofcurrent biological
knowledge. The network model allows ustotime- and cost-effectively generate hypotheses
and predict gene knockouts that may influence theoutcome oftheSASPin-tireo.
Intheprocess ofmodeling, wefirst created individual models ofDNA damage and proin-
flammatory signaling. Inanext step, wefused these twosub-networks tothemodel presented
here. InS1Text, weanalyzed theimpact ofintegrating both pathways inoneBoolean network
model. Our results indicate that there isnotonly aneffect ofDNA damage intheproinflam-
matory signaling butalso vice versa. Ononehand, wededuce astabilization oftheDNA dam-
ageresponse network astheintegration ofboth sub-networks leads toareduction ofpossible
attractors (87to19). Ontheother hand, theinner dynamics ofeach sub-network stay intact,
showing biologically reproducible signaling cascades (e.g. Fig4).
Inthesimulation without DNA damage, only activation ofcellcycle regulation genes that
facilitate cellcycle progression were observed [38]. Incontrast, when weentered DNA damage
into thenetwork, wedetected early activation oftheDNA damage response (DDR) followed
byap53/p21 mediated cellcycle arrest and atalater time point theactivation ofproinflamma-
tory signaling through NF-κB [39, 40]. Weutilized theBoolean network tosimulate knockout
and overexpression states that have thepower toinhibit both IL-6 and IL-8 activation, such as
knockouts ofATM and RelA ortheoverexpression ofIκBα, that have previously been pub-
lished todecrease IL-8 orIL-6 expression and secretion in-tireo [7,9,34]. One ofthemost
prominent knockout suggestions obtained wasthat ofNEMO, which acts asanessential mod-
ulator ofNF-κB signaling and isamajor link between DDR and NF-κB signaling [41]. There-
fore, itisasuitable target toprevent NF-κB activation, while maintaining therepair potential
oftheDDR. Taken together thesein-silico data suggest NF-κB tobeoneofthemajor SASPFig3.Natura llyoccurrin gnetwork states upon DNA damage. Upon DNA damag ethefirstresponse ofthecellis

activators inresponse toDNA damage activating allthree mediators ofproinflammatory sig-
naling depicted inthisnetwork.
Forthesake ofmanageability, themodel presented here waslimited toacore setofpath-
ways involved insenescence and theSASP. Ofcourse, thevalue oftheresults could stillbe
enriched byadding even more components and additional pathways, such asamore detail
view onCEBP-signaling, growth factor signaling and theexpansion ofcellcycle related signal-
ing. This would enable tosimulate aneven deeper level ofsignaling involved intheSASP.
Another factor that wasnotviewed inthiswork istheinfluence oftheintensity levels and tim-
ingofexpression and stimuli ontheoutcome oftheSASP. Physiologically occurring DNA
damage, forexample, isnotanallornothing event butrather comes indifferent levels and
lengths ofdamage that cantrigger amultitude ofdifferent reactions inthecell. Infuture
works, itwould beinteresting toaddthese into themodel. Such extension would allow simula-
tions oftheexact amount and timing ofdamage needed totrigger full-blown SASP rather than
senescence. Furthermore, itwould possibly reveal atwhich point thecelldecides that itisben-
eficial totrigger SASP signaling inorder towarn thesystem ofthedamage and initiate clear-
ance asopposed totrying torepair itself.
IL-6 and IL-8 reinforce senescence inanautocrine and paracrine way, concomitantly pre-
venting senescent cells from exiting cellcycle arrest and forcing neighboring cells into senes-
cence themselves [3,42]. Persistent DDR activity, that isalso known toinduce IL-6 and IL-8
secretion [9],could beshown invarious premalignant and malignant lesionsin-tito, and is
hypothesized tobeonethemain causes ofaging [9,43,44]. Due tothisability topromote inva-
siveness ofcancer cells and thespreading ofsenescence toneighboring cells IL-6 and IL-8 are
ofspecial interest [3,45]. While itisprobably notdetrimental totransiently activate therespec-
tivesignaling pathways, thelong-term persistence ofunrepairable DNA damage leads toa
lasting activation ofNF-κB through theDDR mechanisms and thereby toaprolonged stimula-
tion ofIL-6 and IL-8. Ultimately, thisinitiates and perpetuates avicious cycle from which cells
cannot escape and causes thedevelopment oftheSASP.
Toexplore and validate previously generated in-silico resultsin-tireo, weisolated murine
dermal fibroblasts from NEMO-floxed mice and transfected these with aCre-recombinase
plasmid todeplete NEMO. Contrary toNEMO knockout MDFs weobserved RelA enrichment
inthenucleus inDNA damaged wildtype cells. This suggests that mainly NEMO isresponsible
fortheforwarding ofDNA damage signals from theDDR toNF-κB signaling.
Wewere particularly interested inachieving inhibition ofIL-6 and IL-8 expression and
secretion in-silico andin-tireo. Aswecould show inourin-vitro results, DNA damaged NEMO
knockout cells didnotreveal anyinduction ofIL-6 orIL-8 homologue mRNA expression, sug-
gesting that DNA damage-triggered IL-6 andIL-8 expression ismainly conferred byNF-κB sig-
naling. This wasconfirmed onprotein level, showing astrong decrease insecretion ofboth IL-6
andIL-8 homologues inNEMO knockout MDFs. Inconclusion, abolishing NEMO issufficient
tonotonly block thesignaling from DDR toNF-κB butalso todecrease expression andsecre-
tion oftwoofthemost prominent andestablished SASP mediators IL-6 andIL-8.
The question arises why damaged senescent cells have tostart expressing and secreting fac-
tors that aredetrimental tothemselves, surrounding cells and tissues. The secretion ofmany
SASP factors canbeexplained firstly bytheattempt toclear senescent cells from tissue bycellsFig4.Knocko utsthat cause in-silico IL-6 and IL-8 inhibition forNFkB knockou t.Network states present

adanger inthenear vicinity. Senescent cells secrete different factors that attract phagocytic
immune cells and induce proteolytic enzymes tofacilitate their migration through theextracel-

beneficial fortheorganism, however once theimmune system cannot keep upwith theemer-
gence ofdamaged cells, detrimental effects accumulate and tissue takes damage [2,47]. Inthis
phase, itwould bebeneficial tohave thepossibility tocounteract theSASP and give the
immune system time tocatch up.

Methods
Mice experiments
Murine dermal fibroblasts from aninducible connective tissue-specific NEMO-deficient
mouse model were used forin-tireo experiments. This mouse line(Col(I)α2-CreERT+;
NEMOf/f)wasgenerated bycrossing Col(I)α2-CreERT transgenic mice [51] with NEMO
floxed mice [35]. These mice were backcrossed toC57BL/6J foratleast 6generations. They
were maintained intheAnimal Facility oftheUniversity ofUlm with 12hlight±dark cycle
and SPF conditions. The breeding ofthemice and allexperiments were approved bytheani-
mal ethical committee (approval number, Tierversuch-Nr. 1102, Regierungspra Èsidium
TuÈbingen, Germany). Formice genotyping standard PCR techniques were used. The
sequences oftheprimers used inthismanuscript aresummarized inS1Table. Briefly, DNA
wasisolated from thetailtipofanindividual mouse using acommercial kit(Easy DNA kit,
Invitrogen). Purified DNA waslater dissolved inTEand used forPCR amplification. The PCR
products were runinQIAxcel Advance system (Qiagen) using theprogram AM320 and then
documented digitally.
Isolation andculture ofmurine dermal fibroblasts
Murine dermal fibroblasts (MDFs) were isolated from earskin ofyoung mice and cultured as
previously described [52].
Induction ofDNA damage
DNA damage wasinduced byadding etoposide tocellculture media ataconcentration of
25μMfor3hours after overnight serum-starvation. Supernatants subsequently removed and
cells were rinsed with PBS before adding fresh culture media. Cells and/or media were used 24
hlater forfurther analysis.
Cloning
Recombineering technology [53] wasused toconstract plasmids containing CDS ofboth Cre
recombinase and fluorescence reporter, mRuby2 oronly mRuby2. pCAG-Cre vector (agift
from Connie Cepko, Addgene plasmid #13775) wasused fortherecombineering. Inthefirst
construct, theaim wastoinsert theT2A-mRuby2 sequence before thestop codon ofCre
recombinase and inthesecond construct, theaim wastoreplace theCreORF with mRuby2
ORF. Inbrief, synthetic DNA fragments were synthesized either asgBlock (IDT) orasGen-
eArt string (Thermo Scientific). Four DNA fragments were synthesized, thefirst onecontained
5'50bphomology regions tothevector (targeting 50nucleotide upstream ofCreORF stop
codon), chloramphenicol and ccdB cassettes and 3'terminal 50bphomology regions tothe
vector (targeting 50nucleotide downstream oflastamino acid coding codon ofCreORF, i.e.,
condon preceding theCreORF stop codon). The second synthetic fragment contained 5'50
bphomology regions tothevector (targeting 50nucleotide upstream ofCreORF start codon),
chloramphenicol and ccdB cassettes and 3'terminal 50bphomology regions tothevector (tar-
geting 50nucleotide downsteram ofCreORF stop codon). The third synthetic fragment con-
tained 5'50bphomology regions tothevector (same asfragment 1),T2A sequence-mRuby2
ORF and 3'terminal 50bphomology regions tothevector (same asfragment 1).The fourth
synthetic fragment contained 5'50bphomology regions tothevector (same asfragment 2),
mRuby2 ORF and 3'terminal 50bphomology regions tothevector (same asfragment 2).E.
colicontaining pCAG-Cre wasprocessed forelectrocompetent using standard methods and
these electrocompetent Ecoli, containing pCAG-Cre were electroporated with adual inducible

expression plasmid pSC101-ccdA-gbaA (agiftfrom Prof. A.Francis Stewart) and selected for
ampicillin 100μg/ml and tetracycline 3.5μg/ml at30ÊC. Next day, 4±5colonies were expanded
and theexpression ofrecombineering proteins, λphageedaα,edaβanaedaγ andedcA (edagbaA)
wasinduced byL-rhamnose (1.4mg/ml). After 1hofL-rhamnose treatment, theinduced E.
coliwere processed forelectrocompetent and then electroprorated either with synthetic DNA
fragments 1or2.After 1hofrecovery inSOC medium, theelectroporated Ecoli, were plated
inLB-agar containing ampicillin 100μg/ml, tetracycline 3.5μg/ml, chloramphenicol 25μg/ml
and 1.4mg/ml L-arabinose. L-arabinose addition induced theexpression ofccdA, theantidote
ofccdB inthat only recombined plasmid containing E.colicansurvive. Thereafter colonies
from fragment 1and fragment 2electroporated E.coliplates were picked and expanded for
theverification offirst recombinant product using restriction digestion analyses. The corre-
sponding colony wasexpanded andedagbaA expression wasinduced byL-rhamnose for1h.
The induced E.colicontaining either recombined DNA fragment 1orfragment 2were made
electrocompetent forthesecond round ofrecombineering. The E.coli, containing recombined
DNA fragment 1then electroporated with synthetic DNA fragment 3.The E.coli, containing
recombined DNA fragment 2were electroporated with synthetic DNA fragment 4.The recov-
ered electroporated E.coliwere plated inLB-agar containing ampicillin 100μg/ml and incu-
bated at37ÊC overnight. Colonies from both plates were picked, expanded and verified forthe
second recombinant products. The correct plasmids were sequenced and verified through
commercial services (Sequiserve, Germany). Plasmid preparation wasperformed using acom-
mercially available kit(Qiagen plasmid plus kit,Qiagen). This plasmid (pCAG-Cre-T2A-
mRuby2) canbeobtained from theauthors onrequest and wasdeposited intheAddgene
repository (Accession ID102989).
Initiation ofCreactivity (NEMO knockout)
Early passage MDFs with afloxed NEMO allele were transfected with aCreexpressing vector
using anelectroporation-bas edtransfection method (Amaxa, Lonza Group). Transfer ofthe
plasmid wasperformed using acommercial kitwith theAMAXA program N24 (Nucleofector
Kits forMouse orRatHepatocytes, Lonza). Successful NEMO knockout wasassessed byPCR
asexplained before.
FACS sorting ofpositive cells
Two days after transfection cellpopulations were purified using themRuby2-based reporter
system included inthepreviously described Cre-expressing vectors. Gating wassetforliving
cells and singlets, sorting wasbased onmRuby2 expression inthePE-channel. FACS-sorting
wasperformed with aFACSAria IIIsystem (BD Biosciences) and analysis wasdone onFACS-
Diva and FlowJo (Tree Star) software.
Immunofluorescenc estaining
Cells were fixed in4%PFA inPBS for15min and thereafter treated with 0.1% Triton X-100
for10min atroom temperature. Blocking wasperformed in5%BSA for1hatroom tempera-
ture. Anti-p65 (#8242, 1:200, Cell Signaling) and anti-γH2A.x (ab22551, 1:200, Abcam) were
used asprimary antibodies overnight at4ÊC. Incubation with thesecondary antibody Alexa
488goat anti-mouse (for γH2A.x, 1:500) and Alexa 555goat anti-rabbit (for p65, 1:500) was
performed atroom temperature for1h.

Western blotting
Western blot analyses were performed asdescribed earlier [54]. Inbrief, murine dermal
fibroblasts were lysed inRIPA lysis buffer (25mM Tris-HCl pH7.6,150mM NaCl, 1%NP-
40,1%sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Thermo Scientific). Cells inRIPA were sonicated using sonopuls HD 2070 and
MS72 microtips (Bandelin). The sonicator setting was 50% power 3cycles and 10secfor
three times. Following sonication, thelysate was centrifuged for15min at14000 rpm and
4ÊC. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was measured byBradford
Assay (Biorad). 50μg ofprotein from each lysate was resolved in4±20% SDS-PAGE, fol-
lowed bytransfer tonitrocellulose membrane and probing themembrane with anti-NEMO
antibody (1:1000, Abcam). The membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled
with HRP for1hr(Jackson ImmunoResearch). Thereafter themembrane was developed by
LumiGLO chemiluminescence reagent (Cell Signaling Technologies) using Fusion FX7 Gel-
doc system (Vilber Lourmat), followed bystripping with Restore Plus Western blot Strip-
ping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) and re-probed with anti-β-actin antibody coupled with
HRP (1:12000, Santa Cruz), finally developed themembrane using LumiGLO.
Quantitative PCR
Twenty-four hours after treatment, total RNA wasisolated from cultured murine dermal
fibroblasts using acommercial kit(RNeasy Mini Kit,Qiagen) asdescribed bythemanufac-
turer. TwoμgofRNA persample were reverse transcribed using illustra Ready-To-Go
RT-PCR Beads (GE Healthcare). Quantity and quality oftotal RNA and cDNA wasassessed
using Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) and QIAxcel Advance system (Qiagen). The 7300
realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystem, Life Technologies) wasused toamplify cDNA using
Power SYBR green mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Sequences forprimers
used inallexperiments and genotyping areprovided inS1Table.
ELISA
After etoposide treatment cells were supplied with fresh culture media. Culture media was
taken foranalysis ofsecreted IL-6 and murine IL-8 homologues (KC and MIP-2) 24hafter
treatment. Media wasstored at-80ÊC until analysis.
Concentrations ofsecreted IL-6 and murine IL-8 homologues after DNA damage were
determined using commercial kits(Mouse IL-6/KC/MIP-2 Quantikine ELISA Kit,R&D) as
described bythemanufacturer.
Statistical calculations
The influence ofaNEMO knockout wascompared towildtype controls based onIL-6, IL-8
homologue and p21mRNA expression aswell asIL-6 and IL-8 homologue protein secretion.
The sample sizeforallexperiments was5pergroup. The expression and secretion ofthetwo
groups wastested using unpaired two-tailed t-test. Furthermore, theinfluence oftheNEMO
knockout compared towildtype controls onthenuclear translocation ofp65wasmeasured

Boolean networks
Inafirst step, IL-and DNA-damage pathways included intheBoolean model ofSASP were
reconstructed individually. Togenerate theindependent gene regulatory networks ofinflam-
matory and DDR signaling, wecollected peer-reviewed literature that isconsidered relevant in
thecontext ofSASP (see Table 1).This literature reports data about thelocal interaction ofkey
genes regulating each pathway. The information wascollected inmurine and human experi-
mentalin-tito andin-tireo studies. Inorder tocontrol thecomplexity ofmodel werestricted
thesetofregulatory factors inthemodel tothemost relevant forSASP and tothose being
important components ofeach pathway. The modeled pathways were chosen based onthe
requirement intheonset and maintenance oftheSASP shown instudies related tosenescence
and theSASP. Intotal 80publications were used todetermine therelationships between the
individual components ofthemodel (Table 1).
After thereconstruction ofBoolean network models ofinflammation and DNA damage
response, both were combined into alarger network. The impact ofcombining thetwonet-
work models instead ofsimulating them independently isshown byadditional analysis inS1
Text. Simulations based onspecific environmental (input) conditions were performed tofind
thecorresponding attractors. Furthermore, toidentify possible interaction targets, i.e.,togen-
erate testable hypotheses about interventions, wefixed corresponding regulatory factors to
either 0or1(modelling ofknockout oroverexpression, similar to[55]) and reran thesimula-
tions (S1Text). Given aninteraction target, welooked fortheattractors that positively influ-
ence theDNA damage response phenotype.
Network figures were drawn with Biotapestry (www.biotapestry.org). Simulations ofthe
Boolean network were performed with thepackage BoolNet [12, 56]inR(www.r-project.org).
This model contains twoexternal signals (DNA damage and Activated Oncogenes). These
signals donotcoincide with genes within thenetwork, butrepresent different stimuli from
external orinternal sources that areknown toactivate theDNA damage response and/or cell

Abstract
Background: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the presence of high levels of glucose leads to
an array of down-regulatory effects known as glucose repression. This process is complex due tothe presence of feedback loops and crosstalk betwe en different pathways, complicating the use of
intuitive approaches to analyze the system.
Results: We established a logical model of yeast gluco se repression, formalized as a hypergraph.
The model was constructed based on verified reg ulatory interactions and it includes 50 gene
transcripts, 22 proteins, 5 metabolites and 118 hyperedges. We computed the logical steady statesof all nodes in the network in order to simulate wildtype and deletion mutant responses todifferent sugar availabilities. Evaluation of the m odel predictive power was achieved by comparing
changes in the logical state of gene nodes with transcriptome data. Overall, we observed 71% truepredictions, and analyzed sources of erro rs and discrepancies for the remaining.
Conclusion: Though the binary nature of logical (Boolean) models entails inherent limitations,
our model constitutes a primary tool for storing reg ulatory knowledge, searching for incoherencies
in hypotheses and evaluating the effect of dele ting regulatory elements involved in glucose
repression.
Background
Signaling and regulatory cascades establish the bridge
between environmental stimuli and cellular responses,
and represent a key aspect of cellular adaptation to
different environmental conditions. Cells can sense
several stimuli, both internally and externally, and the
received information will subsequently be propagated
through a cascade of physi co-chemical signals. The
ultimate recipients of these signals will determine how
the cell responds, by acting at different regulatory levels
(transcriptionally , translationally, p ost-translationally,allosterically, etc). Contrary to metabolic networks,
most signaling and regulatory pathways are relatively
poorly studied and signali ng properties of a protein
cannot be easily derived from its gene sequence [1, 2].
Moreover, signal transduction networks operate over a
wide range of time-scales, and due to the presence of
feedback loops and cross talk it is difficult to discern
how concurrent signals are processed. Thus, methods to
analyze and model signal transduction and regulatory
circuits are of prime importance in biology, medicine
and cell engineering, since they can bring insights into

the mechanistic events underlying complex cellular
behavior. The availability of models for signaling and
regulatory cascades represents an opportunity to expand
the search space when looking for intervention targets
that may lead to desired phenotypes –e.g. when looking
for better drug targets in medicine, designing novel
regulatory circuits in synthetic biology or finding
regulatory targets that can release metabolic control in
metabolic engineering.
Most eukaryotic cells, including many yeasts and
humans, can sense the availability of carbon sources in
their surroundings and, in the presence of their favorite
sugar (often glucose), trigger a cascade of signals that
will repress the utilization of less-favorite sugars as well
as the function of different catabolic routes [3-5]. This
phenomenon is commonly termed carbon-catabolite or
glucose repression. Because of its role in nutrient sensing
and its industrial impact on the simultaneous utilization
of different carbon sources, glucose repression has been a
model system for studying signaling and regulation. In
particular, glucose repression in the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae has been extensively studied and two main
signaling pathways have bee n identified: a repression
pathway, mediated through the protein kinase Snf1 and
the transcription factor Mig1, and a glucose induction
pathway, mediated through the membrane receptors
Snf3 and Rgt2 and the transcription factor Rgt1 (for
review see, for example, [4, 6-8]). Growing evidencesuggests the existence of ext ensive cross talking between
these two pathways. Figure 1 summarizes key aspects of
the system. Besides the role of glucose repression on the
utilization of alternative carbon sources, glucose repres-
sion in yeast leads to the transcriptional shutdown of
genes related to respiration, mitochondrial activities, and
gluconeogenesis [9]. This transcriptional behavior causes
the wild-type yeast to exert respiro-fermentative meta-
bolism during growth on excess glucose, redirecting
carbon towards by-products of metabolism such as
ethanol, acetate and glycerol, at the cost of biomass
formation. Despite being an extensively studied system,
knowledge on yeast glucose repression is still far from
complete and key questions remain, including: what
exactly triggers the cascade si gnal(s)? How to differenti-
ate between causes and consequences? How does the
knowledge derived from phenotypic observations relate
to mechanistic events? How does the current knowledge
on glucose repression fit with available high-throughput
data? In order to attempt to bring insights into these
questions, we aim here at creating a mechanistic, semi-
quantitative model of gluco se repression signaling
cascades and genetic regulatory circuits in yeast.
Modeling approaches of diffe rent levels of abstraction
have been proposed to analyze and simulate signaltransduction and regulatory networks, ranging from
purely topological to kinetic models. While attractive
in principle, quantitative kinetic models based on ODEs
are hampered by difficulties in determining the necessary
parameters and kinetic equations. At the other extreme,
strictly descriptive mode ls have also been reported
[10-12], in which the precision of the formalism
proposed, based on process engineering, establish a
clear and unique qualitative representation of the
network interactions. Somewhere in between lie more
semi-quantitative and qualitative approaches that
require the topological description of signaling interac-
tions and make use of well-established mathematical
frameworks to analyze network structure and function-
ality. Such methods include (i) stoichiometric represen-
tation and extreme pathway analysis [13], (ii) Boolean
(on/off) and Bayesian (probabilistic) representation of
interactions [14-16], (iii) logical hypergraph representa-
tion and logical steady state analyses [17], and (iv) Petri
nets graph representation and simulations [18-20]. All
these methods describe signal flow qualitatively within
a mathematical formalism and without loss of
Figure 1
Simplified representation of the main glucoserepression pathways . Glucose is transported into the cell
by hexose transporters with different affinities ( HXT1-
HXT16 ). Inside the cell, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose
6-phosphate by Hxk2, therefore entering into carbonmetabolism. An unknown signal triggered by high glucose
levels leads to inactivation of the Snf1 complex. This
inactivation is regulated by the protein phosphatase Glc7-Reg1. Inactive Snf1 cannot phosphorylate Mig1, which thus
remains in the nucleus under high glucose levels, exerting
repression of transcription o f several genes. At low glucose
concentrations, when Snf1 becomes active, Mig1 is
phosphorylated and translocates to the cytosol, releasing
repression. Glucose is sensed by two sensors located in thecell membrane, Rgt2 and Snf3. At high glucose levels, thesignal from these sensors leads to SCF
Grr1mediated
ubiquitination and consequent degradation of Mth1 and Std1,
which are required for Rgt1 activation.BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/7


information on the network topology, allowing insight-
ful computations on network structure such as evaluat-
ing the degree of cross talk, determining all possible
elementary 'flux' modes and calculating the number of
theoretically possible positive and negative feedback
loops. Moreover, logical hypergraph analyses and Petri
net models also have the potential to be used for semi-
quantitative simulation of network behavior, since they
allow simple predictions of the state of a system in
response to different stimuli.
In this work, we reconstructed the signaling and
transcriptional regulatory network of glucose repression
inS. cerevisiae based on established knowledge reported in
the literature. We converted this information into a
logical hypergraph, and performed structural and func-
tional analyses on the network following the framework
proposed by Klamt and co -workers [17]. Next, we
performed logical steady st ate analyses to compute the
state of all nodes in the system under all possible
environmental conditions ( sugars availability), and for
all different single gene deletions and some double gene
deletions. Furthermore, we developed a framework to
evaluate model predictions by comparing changes in the
state of the regulatory layer against changes in gene
expression data (transcriptome data was available for
several knockouts of the system). Based on the results
from the model evaluation, we identified main errors
and discuss possible sources of discrepancies, as well asthe inherent limitations to Boolean modeling. Our
results point towards the existence of incoherencies
between high-throughput data and literature-based
knowledge related with gl ucose repression. To our
knowledge, this represents the first attempt to mechan-
istically and semi-quantitatively model glucose repres-
sion signaling and regulatory pathways in the yeast S.
cerevisiae .
Results
Reconstruction of the signaling/regulatory network
and model setup
Glucose repression signaling and regulatory network was
reconstructed from low-throughput data reported in
peer-reviewed publications . Information was gathered
based on biochemical studies and physiological obser-
vations, and it was included in a collection database
containing: (i) list of proteins with sensor, signaling or
transcription factor functions found to be related to
glucose repression; (ii) list of genes known to be
transcriptionally regulated by glucose repression related
transcription factors; (iii) type of regulation exerted on
each of the previous species by metabolites and/or
regulatory proteins. The reconstructed network accounts
for 72 species (corresponding to 50 genes) and 148interactions, which cover most of the current knowledge
on the Mig1/Snf1 and Snf3/Rgt2 pathways, as well as
galactose and maltose regulatory systems. Transcription
factors included are Rgt1, Mig1, Mig2, Mig3, Sip4, Cat8,
MalR and Gal4. Regulatory targets include genes encod-
ing hexose transporters and enzymes involved in maltose
catabolism, gluconeogenesis and the Leloir pathway. The
complete list of species and interactions considered is
given as supplementary material (Additional file 1).
Thereafter, the reconstructed signaling/regulatory net-
work was converted into a logical hypergraph (Figure 2),
representing all interactions in a logical manner (Figure 3
and Additional file 2), according to the framework
proposed by Klamt et al . [17] to model signaling
networks. The conversion of signaling and regulatory
interactions into Boolean functions was based on
described functions reported in the literature (the
rationale for the choice of less obvious Boolean
functions for certain interactions is explained in the
Additional file 2). The resulting hypergraph consists of
77 nodes (50 genes, 22 proteins, 3 extracellular
metabolites and 2 intracell ular metabolites) and 118
hyperedges, and represents a logical model for glucose
repression signaling and regulatory pathways. For ease of
visualization, we have depi cted the hypegraph into four
separate sub-networks, each representing in more detail
a different system: Mig1/Snf1 and Snf3/Rgt2 pathways
(Figure 3A), galactose regulation (Figure 3B), maltoseregulation (Figure 3C) and the Sip4/Cat8 regulatory
system (Figure 3D). The model takes as input the
availability of carbon sources (glucose, galactose, and
maltose) and outputs the logical steady state of the
network.
In our model, nodes can assume one of two logical
states, 1 or 0, corresponding to on or off, or in more
subtle instances, higher or lower activity. For protein
nodes, this can most simply be interpreted as a protein
being active (1) or inactive (0), whereas in the case of
gene nodes, it can be seen as a gene being expressed (1)
or not (0). We used the model to analyze structural
characteristics of the network and to compute logical
steady states of all nodes in the network. In particular,
we simulated how gene transcripts change their logical
state in response to perturbations (e.g., availability of
different sugars and different gene knockouts), and
evaluated the predictions by using available transcrip-
tional datasets for different carbon source conditions
and yeast deletion mutants. During logical states
simulations, although most nodes were left uncon-
strained, a few nodes were assigned a default value of 1.
E.g., GRR1 was set to a fix state of 1 since its regulation is
not considered in the model (otherwise, no unique
logical steady state would exist). Also, in the case ofBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/7


genes constitutively expressed at a basal level such as
MALT , encoding a maltose transporter, the node state
was set to a fix value of 1.
Structural and functional analyses of the network
Logical steady state analyses were performed for allcombinations of sugar availability for the wild type, all
single gene knockout mutants (24 cases), and three
double gene deletion mutants of interest, in a total of
224 simulations (see Additional file 3). We notice that
most of the gene nodes change their logical state in over

hypegraph is an interaction network where each edge (or
hyperarc) connects a set of sta rt-nodes (tails) to an end-node
(head), and the combination of incoming hyperarcs to an
end-node represents a Boole an expression. Any Boolean
expression can be written in a disjunctive normal form (onlyusing AND, OR and NOT operators). On the disjunctivenormal form, expressions are built up by literals (i.e.
variables or their negation) connected by AND relations
forming clauses, and clauses can then be connected by ORrelationships. In the logical hypergraph, each clause is
represented by a hyperarc, while separate hyperarcs linked
to an end-node represents clauses connected by an ORrelationship. When the value of a tail species is negated, this
is marked by a repression symbol in the corresponding
hyperarc (see also the symbolic explanation in Figure 3). TheBoolean function determining the state of a node is thus
given by all the incoming hyperedges.

10% of the simulations, but only few ( MTH1 ,MALR ,
GAL3 ,GAL4 and CAT8 ) change in more than 15% of the
simulations. The predictions for the wild type along with
a subset of the deletion mutants for which transcriptome
data was available were analyzed and used to evaluate
the model, as will be discussed below. The capability to
make semi-quantitative pre dictions of gene expression
levels and protein activity for any combination of gene
deletions and nutrient conditions is a key feature of the
model.
The reconstructed network contains 35 negative and 14
positive feedback loops, which is indicative of the high
degree of crosstalk between pathways and complex
cause-effect relationships. This is further supported by
the dependency matrix of the network (Figure 4), which
is based solely on the underlying network interaction
graph without information on Boolean functions. In the
matrix, yellow elements represent an ambivalent rela-
tionship between an ordered pair of species ( i,j), where i
and jrepresents the column and the row number,
respectively, in the sense that both activating and
inhibiting paths exist from itoj. Dark or light green
(/red) elements, D ij, indicate that species iis a total or
non-total activator (/inhibitor) of species j, respectively,
i.e. only activating (/inhibiting) paths from itojexist
and feedback loops are either absent (total) or present
(non-total) –see Figure 4 legend for details. Examining
the dependency matrix, the large number of ambivalentrelationships (represented by yellow elements) as well as
the prevalence of negative feedback loops in signaling
paths (light green or red fields) is noteworthy. It
underscores the difficulties in making predictions
based on intuitive approaches and emphasizes the
need for a logical modeling framework. The matrix
also reveals the high degree of crosstalk between the
Mig1/Snf1 and Snf3/Rgt2 pat hways, since it is quickly
noted that the signaling proteins in one pathway
generally affect proteins in the other pathway.
Model evaluation
In order to evaluate the capability of the logical model topredict differential gene expression, we performed
logical steady state analysis of the glucose repression
regulatory response for five different gene knockouts,
and compared the results with available whole-genome
gene expression from DNA-microarrays. We used data
from the yeast mutants Δrgt1,Δmig1 ,Δmig1Δmig2 ,
Δsnf1Δsnf4,Δgrr1 and their isogenic reference strains.
This type of analysis not only gives an indication of the
model's predictive strength, but also hints at possible
errors in the model (and eventually in the underlying
hypotheses from the literature) in the cases where
discrepancies between model and observation occur.

relationship between an effecting species and an affected
species, specified at the bottom of the column and at the endof the row, respectively. A yellow field in the intersection of

thcolumn and jthrow signifies that the iths p e c i e si sa n
ambivalent factor with respect to the jthspecies, i.e. that
both activating and repressing/inhibiting paths from the ithto

inhibiting and activating paths exists from exterior glucose tothe Sip4 protein, i.e., exterior glucose is an ambivalent factor
with respect to Sip4. Similarly, a dark green field and a light
green field indicate a total and a non-total activator,respectively, i.e., only activating paths exist and negative
feedback loops are either ab sent (total) or present (non-
total). Dark red and light red fields represent total and non-total repressors/inhibitors, respectively. A black field
indicates that no path exists from A to B. The large number
of black columns in the middle corresponds to outputspecies (sinks), which per definition are non-affectingtowards all species. Due to the directional nature of the
interaction network, the matrix is not symmetric (e.g. Sip4 is
non-affecting toward exterior glucose). See nomenclaturenote for gene and protein species in the legend of Figure 3.BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/7


The best we can hope to achieve with a Boolean model is
a correct prediction of the sign of the change in gene
expression, i.e., the model prediction Y imodshould equal
the experimental observation Y iexpwhen evaluating
change in expression of gene ifollowing a knockout or
change in conditions. In order to assess what experi-
mental results should be regarded as ac h a n g e ,i ti s
necessary to make an interpretation of the gene expres-
sion data that allows a comparison with the binary
outputs of the Boolean model. Intuitively, the experi-
mental change should be relatively large and statistically
significant in order to be reflected by the discrete
Boolean model. Therefore, we established a fold-change
threshold ([FC min| = 1.5; see Methods for fold-change
definition) and a Student's t-test p-value cut-off ( a=
0.05) for all pairwise gene expression comparisons
between a deletion mutant and its isogenic reference
strain. All genes with p-value < aand FC ≥FCmin(or FC ≤
-FC min) were assigned with a value of Y iexp=1( o rY iexp=
-1), and 0 otherwise. Such co nversion of gene expression
into discrete Boolean values based on a somewhat
subjective threshold may yield a number of type-2 (false
negatives) and type-1 (false positives) errors.
The hereby identified experimental variation, Y iexp,w a s
then compared with the model prediction, Y imod,f o r
each gene i.Yimodwas determined by the difference in
Boolean output for gene ibetween the mutant and the
reference state (wildtype), at a defined external condi-
tion. Thus, Y imodcan assume the values -1, 0 or 1,
corresponding to a decrease, no change or increase in
gene expression on transcript iin the mutant, respec-
tively. Model prediction capabilities were evaluated
based on the difference |Y imod-Yiexp|, with a value of
0 meaning a correct prediction, a value of 1 implying a
small error, and a value of 2 indicating a large error (only
happening when model prediction and experimental
results point towards opposite directions).
A summary of the results from the comparison between
model prediction and experimental up- and down-
regulation for all five different knockouts evaluated isshown in Table 1. In the following, we discuss more
thoroughly the results for Δrgt1, and use this to analyze
common reasons for discrepancies in all the knockouts.
The remaining comparisons are briefly commented
afterwards.
Evaluation of Δrgt1 mutant
Transcriptome data for the yeast Δrgt1 mutant and its
isogenic reference strain is available from [21] during
shake flasks cultivations us ing galactose as the single
carbon source. Sampling was made in the mid-exponen-
tial phase, where pseudo-steady-state can be assumed
(i.e., growth rate and physiological yields appear
constant during the exponential phase, despite changes
in the concentration of extracellular metabolites). We
converted the gene expression data from this study into
Yiexpaccording to the procedure described above, and
compared it with the simulation results Y imod(Table 1).
Yimodare derived from logical steady state analyses of the
logical model assuming galactose present and all other
carbon sources absent. The logical steady states were firstdetermined for the origin al model without further
constrains (X
i,WT). Afterwards, in order to simulate the
RGT1 gene deletion, the node RGT1 of the hypergraph
was set to zero, and a new logical steady state analysis
was performed (X i,RGT1 ). Y imodis given by the difference
between X i,RGT1 and X i,WT.
In general, the model predictions are very good for the
Δrgt1 mutant , with 82% true predictions, reflecting the
fact that Rgt1 along with its regulators has been
extensively studied [21-30]. Only for 6 out of the 34
genes evaluated, the experimental fold changes do not
correspond to model prediction. The six genes are SNF3 ,
MTH1 ,MIG2 ,MAL 33 (which encodes a MAL regulator),
SUC2 and HXT8 . In the following, the causes of these
discrepancies are investigated.
Analysis of discrepancies in SNF3. SNF3 encodes a high-
affinity glucose sensor located in the plasma membrane.
Gene expression data shows no differential expression of
SNF3 in the Δrgt1 mutant ( p-value = 0.88, FC = 1.03).Table 1: Summary of results from the model evaluation

However, in the model this gene is found to be down-
regulated in the mutant relative to the wild type. The
most likely explanation for this discrepancy lies in the
logical equation for SNF3 applied in the model:
SNF3 =N O T( M i g 1O RM i g 2 )
= (NOT Mig1) AND (NOT Mig2)
In the model, RGT1 deletion leads to an active Mig2 and
consequently repression of SNF3 . The most plausible
explanation for this is that the model overestimates the
importance of Mig2 and that, in reality, the presence of
active Mig2 by itself is not enough to prevent SNF3
transcription. Nevertheless, this explanation cannot be
accepted out of hand: the dependency matrix reveals that
RGT1 is an ambivalent factor with regard to SNF3 ,i . e . ,
both repressing and activating paths from RGT1 toSNF3
exist. It is thus possible that Mig2 is indeed a significant
repressor of SNF3 , but that other important, repressing
pathways from RGT1 toSNF3 are also deactivated by the
RGT1 deletion.
A closer inspection of the signaling paths from RGT1 to
SNF3 in the hypergraph reveals that, from the 8 existing
possible paths, 4 are repressing paths of the form RGT1 -
> Rgt1 -| Mig2/Mig3 -| Mig1 -| SNF3 .T h i sm e a n st h a t
Rgt1 represses Mig2 and Mig3, both of which repress
Mig1, which then represses SNF3 (this constitutes 4
paths because two hyperedges connect RGT1 to Rgt1,
either with Mth1 or Std1 as the second tail). It seems
unlikely that these 4 signal flux modes play significant
physiological roles since (i) no significant role of Mig3
has ever been found [31-33], and (ii) Mig2 can at most
serve to attenuate Mig1 expre ssion since the two proteins
are active at basically the same conditions.
Analysis of discrepancies in MTH1. Mth1 is a signaling
protein intermediate between the membrane sensors
Snf3/Rgt2 and the transcription factor Rgt1 [23, 24].
Gene expression of MTH1 is found to be up-regulated in
theΔrgt1 mutant, whereas the model predicts the
expression level of MTH1 to be unchanged. Despite
the fact that Rgt1 repression of MTH1 is reported in the
literature (in fact in the same paper where Δrgt1
transcriptome data is presented) [21], the repression of
MTH1 by Rgt1 is ignored for logical steady state
calculations for two reasons. Firstly, Kaniak et al.s t a t e
that this transcriptional repression is weak (the tran-
scriptome analysis was actually complemented with
promotor-lacZ fusions, and it was found that MTH1 ,
both in the wild-type and in the Δrgt1mutant, is subject
to considerable glucose repression, not glucose induc-
tion as would be expected for a gene primarily regulatedby Rgt1 [21]. Secondly, in terms of the Boolean model,including Rgt1 in a "NOT Rgt1 AND-relationship" would
mean that Mth1 would always be inactive when Rgt1 is
active, which would be somewhat incongruous consider-
ing that MTH1 seems to encode a co-repressor of Rgt1.
This example illustrates the difficulties in incorporating
negative feedback loops in a binary Boolean model.
It should also be noted that MTH1 is, according to the
model at least, one of the most heavily regulated genes
in the network, being transcriptionally regulated by Rgt1,
Mig1, Mig2, Mig3 and Gal4. This makes a literature
based determination of the Boolean function governing
its expression particularly difficult.
Analysis of discrepanc ies in MIG2 and HXT8. MIG2
encodes for a homologue of the transcription factor
Mig1, while HXT8 encodes for a plasma membrane
hexose transporter. MIG2 was not found to change
experimentally, at least not in terms of our defined
"Boolean fold change" threshold, but was found to be
up-regulated in the model. This discrepancy is, most
likely, due to a type-2 error in the inference of gene
expression change from the transcriptome data. Even
though the average fold change observed experimentally
was 3.4, the p-value of this change was only 0.29. As this
is above the cut-off value of 0.05, this change is deemed
insignificant and the gene is attributed a "Boolean fold
change" of 0. Nevertheless, the model prediction is in
good agreement with the results of the continuedinvestigation by Kaniak et al., which included promo-
ter-lacZ fusions and ChIP experiments, and showed that
Rgt1 is a strong (and possibly the only) transcriptional
repressor of MIG2 . The discrepancy for HXT8 seems to
have similar reasons.
Analysis of discrepancies in MAL33 (MALR). Expression of
MAL 33, encoding a MAL regulator, was found to be
experimentally repressed in the mutant, while it
remained unchanged in the model. The three genes
required for maltose metabolism are mapped in various
MAL loci, of which 5 are currently known [34, 35]. In the
model, no distinction is made between the different
complex loci. Since this is a recurrent discrepancy in all
evaluations performed, we present a general discussion
on the MAL regulatory system later in the Discussion
section.
Analysis of discrepancies in SUC2. Expression of SUC2 ,
encoding for invertase (sucrose hydrolyzing enzyme),
was not found to be significantly different between the
Δrgt1mutant and wild-type, whereas the model predicts
a decrease in gene expression in the mutant. This
discrepancy illustrates both the difficulties in choosing
the correct logical equation for a specific species basedBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/7


on literature and in converting a continuous reality to a
binary model.
I nt h em o d e li ti sa s s u m e dt h a tb o t hM i g 1a n dM i g 2
should be absent in order for SUC2 to be expressed at
high levels (SUC2 = NOT (Mig1 OR Mig2)), cf. Lutfiyya
et al. who found that the single deletions had relatively
low impact on SUC2 expression level, whereas Δmig1Δ-
mig2 double deletion had great effect [36]. Contrary to
this, Klein et al . found a large increase in SUC2
expression in a Δmig1 strain and further increase by
additional disruption of MIG2 [37]. The Klein et al .
observations could have been implemented in the model
via a Boolean function where the absence of either one
of the two repressors induces expression of SUC2 (i.e.,
SUC2 = NOT (Mig1 AND Mig2)) or, alternatively, by
simply ignoring Mig2 in the equations. While imple-
menting either of the alternatives would have led to
correct model prediction for the knockout (as judged by
comparison with the expression data), the actual output
forSUC2 in the wild-type would have been the same
regardless of the chosen equation (since absence of Mig
1 or of both Mig1 and Mig2 would always result in active
SUC2 ). Nevertheless, the ambiguity in the literature
combined with the difficulty of imposing a discrete
model on a continuous reality made the choice of logical
equation extremely hard in this case.
The model apparently mistakenly predicts a decrease in
SUC2 expression, because RGT1 deletion causes MIG2
to be expressed (i.e. Mig2 becomes active) which then
leads to repression of SUC2 with the chosen Boolean
equations. Based on this evaluation, and assuming that a
type-2 error has not occurred, it therefore seems reason-
able to say that the model overestimates the importance
of Mig2 in the regulation of SUC2 . Alternatively, it is
possible that MIG2 transcription is induced, but that the
Mig2 protein is also post-translationally regulated, some-
thing that is not described in the model or, to the best of
our knowledge, in the literature. This could mean that
Mig2 protein activity is not increased by the deletion of
RGT1 , despite the eventual increase in transcript levels.
Evaluation of Δmig1 and Δmig1Δmig2 mutants
Transcriptome data for Δmig1 andΔmig1Δmig2 mutants,
and their isogenic reference strain was available from
[38] during aerobic batch cultivations using 40 g/L
glucose as single carbon source. Samples were taken in
the mid-exponential phase at a residual glucose con-
centration of 20 g/L. Therefore, experimental observa-
tions were evaluated against model predictions with only
glucose present. For both knockouts, the percentage of
true predictions is of 63% (Table 1). When examining
the discrepancies between experimental observationsand model predictions, it is particularly noticeable that
model predictions for MAL and GAL regulatory genes are
almost always wrong. In particular, in the Δmig1 case
both MAL13 and GAL4 evaluation produces a large error
(i.e., |Y imod-Yiexp| = 2), meaning that the experimental
direction of regulation is opposite to that predicted by
the model. Whereas in the case of MAL g e n e st h i si so n e
of several discrepancies observed in this work (see
Discussion), in the case of GAL4 we find the experi-
mental gene expression data from [38] to directly
contradict the results of a Northern blot analysis [39].
While the former study showed a decrease in GAL4 levels
upon deletion of MIG1 , the second showed more than 6-
fold increase in the levels of GAL4 transcripts in a Δmig1
mutant, in a medium with the same glucose concentra-
tion (as cited in [40]).
Evaluation of Δgrr1 mutant
Transcriptome data for Δgrr1 and its isogenic reference
strain were also available from [38], at conditions
corresponding to high extracellular glucose concentra-
tion. Evaluation of model predictions for Δgrr1 yielded
the poorest results, with only 39% of true predictions
( T a b l e1 ) .T h i si sp r o b a b l yd u et ot h ef a c tt h a t ,d e s p i t e
being an important player in a large number of cellular
activities such as cell morphology, heavy metal tolerance,
osmotic stress and nitrogen starvation [25, 30], Grr1 is in
the model only represented as a simple regulator acting
upstream of Rgt1. The highly pleiotropic nature of Grr1
is revealed in the DNA-microarray data, where 24 out of
38 evaluated genes are found to be differentially
expressed (in the Boolean sense). The low percentageof correct predictions illust rates the danger of including
species without properly a ccounting for all key func-
tions. We notice that the model even fails to efficiently
predict the alteration of ge ne expression for targets of
Rgt1 (e.g. HXT2 ,HXT4 ,HXT5 and HXT8 ), which,
according to the model, should act downstream of
Grr1. However, given the scale of the perturbations
caused by GRR1 deletion, it is difficult to say whether
these discrepancies are caused by faults in the current
hypotheses underlying the model or by secondary effects
not taken into consideration, such as altered
metabolism.
Evaluation of Δsnf1Δsnf4 mutant
Transcriptome data for Δsnf1Δsnf4 and its isogenic
reference strain were available from [41], during aerobic
continuous cultivations at dilution rate 0.1 h-1and
glucose (10 g/L) as single carbon source. Under these
conditions, the residual glucose concentration inside the
fermentor is very low, and typically no glucose repres-
sion is observed. This behavior is, to some extent, similar
to what happens in the absence of glucose. Thus,BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/7


experimental observations were compared with model
predictions for the case where all sugars were absent. The
percentage of true predictions was only 50% (Table 1). A
surprising discrepancy was observed for the expression
levels of CAT8 and SIP4 , which were predicted to
decrease, but are found to be experimentally unchanged
(in the Boolean sense). Nevertheless, the prediction of a
down-regulatory effect on Cat8 and Sip4 gene targets
(ICL1 ,FBP1 ,PCK1 ,MLS1 ,MDH2 ,ACS1 ,SFC1 ,CAT2 ,
IDP2 and JEN1 ) is confirmed experimentally. While the
observed changes for CAT8 and SIP4 are not statistically
significant, they are nevertheless in the predicted direc-
tion, and the occurrence of type-2 errors is therefore
likely. An additional and likely explanation is that the
effect of the Snf1-Snf4 complex on repression by Sip4
and Cat8 is, to a larger extent, mediated via direct
posttranslational regulation rather than via indirect,
Mig1 mediated transcriptional regulation.
Global evaluation of predictive power
Boolean models lie at the boundary between qualitativeand quantitative models. For the present model of
glucose repression, testing current hypotheses is at leastas important as making predictions. These goals, how-
ever, are connected in the sense that one way in which
inconsistencies in the model (and consequently, in the
hypotheses proposed in the literature) are revealed is
through failure to make predictions. Therefore, evaluat-
ing the predictive power of the model is an important
task. Above, we looked into the capacity of the model to
predict differential gene expression for individual knock-
outs, and observed that the frequencies of correct
predictions varied between the different knockouts
(and in no case were all predictions true). What remains
to be demonstrated is that th e correct predictions were
not obtained by chance.
For the simplest random model, the probabilities that
the expression of a gene is predicted to be unchanged,
up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively, would all

correct prediction in each situation would also be 1/3.
Table 1 shows that, for all knockouts, the frequency of
correct predictions exceeds 33%. We tested the signifi-
cance of this occurrence by applying a binomialdistribution test and p

predictions (Table 2). Overall and for most knockouts,
the very low p-values unambiguously show that the
results were not obtained due to chance. However, for
Δgrr1 it cannot be shown at 95% confidence level that
the prediction rate is significantly better than with a
random model.
Next, we applied the same distribution to test the
significance of the fraction of large errors observed
(i.e., |Y imod-Yiexp| = 2) in the subset of cases where
differential expression was observed experimentally as
well as in the model. Since in this case there would be
5 0 %c h a n c eo fac o r r e c tp r e d i c t i o ni fn o t h i n gw a sk n o w n
ap r i o r i , we use p 0= 0.5. Out of 41 cases, only 3 cases of
opposite signs predictions are observed. This is signifi-
cant with a p-value less than 10-90. The three encountered
large errors were in two predictions for MALR (discussed
below) and one prediction for GAL4 in the Δmig1
mutant (most likely arising from the microarray experi-
ment itself, as discussed above).
Discussion
The goal of our Boolean network modeling and analyses
was dual. First, we wanted to use the model to test how
the underlying biological hypotheses (for signal trans-
duction and transcriptional regulation) found in litera-
ture fit the observations from genome-wide gene
expression studies of different signaling knockout
mutants. We proposed a framework to compare simula-
tion results with experimental observations and looked
for discrepancies between the two. These discrepancies
hinted at the identification of different types of errors, as
discussed below. Second, we wanted to evaluate the
model's predictive strength and investigate to what
extent we could use it to simulate transcriptional
responses upon deletion of various components of the
glucose repression cascade. Such a model can eventually
be combined with genome-scale stoichiometric meta-
bolic models to further constrain the solution space
during optimization problem s (e.g., flux balance analy-
sis). Gene expression data in the form of discrete
Boolean on/off information has been previously used
to constrain fluxes (or more precisely, the genes
encoding the enzymes cata lyzing the corresponding

average proportion of correct predictions (X/N) is 1/3, against the alte rnative hypothesis that the model yields a higher proportion of true

reactions) in stoichiometric metabolic models, adding a
layer of transcriptional regulation into this type of
models [42, 43]. Our approach goes even further by
also including signaling information, opening new doors
to search for targets that can release metabolic control at
different regulatory levels.
Glucose repression is a complex and intertwined
regulatory system, with extensive cross-talk among
pathways, feedback loops and different levels of regula-
tion responding at different time scales. This makes it
difficult to decide the logical rules describing some of the
species and their influence, i n particular species that are
heavily regulated (e.g., Mth1) or those with extensive
pleiotropic effects (e.g., Grr 1). Noticeably, we explicitly
decided not to include hexokinase-2 (Hxk2) in the
model, despite Hxk2 being hinted to be a key regulator
in the Snf1/Mig1 pathway (in addition of its role as a
glycolytic enzyme). This decision was based on observa-
tions that changes in the activity of Hxk2 lead to an array
of effects, namely altered metabolism, which may
indirectly trigger other regulatory responses [38, 44].
Thus, it becomes difficult to describe the role of Hxk2 in
a model of moderate size like ours. More knowledge on
the exact signaling and regulatory roles of Hxk2 in
glucose repression will be necessary before it can be
included in our model.
We performed logical steady state analyses for the
wildtype, all single gene deletions and three double
gene deletions under all com binations of sugar avail-
ability, and observed that most nodes change their
logical steady state in more than 10% of the gene
deletion simulations. Thereafter, we evaluated the model
predictions against available gene expression data by
comparing changes in transcript levels (converted into a
Boolean form) with simulations of the logical steady
state of the model. Determination of the overall true
prediction rate for the analyzed knockouts shows that
Δrgt1 yielded the best results (82%), while true predic-
tions for Δgrr1 were the weakest (only 39%). The highest
prediction rate found for Δrgt1 is probably related with
the fact that many of the regulatory mechanisms
included in our model are originated from transcrip-
tional studies on the role of Rgt1. Conversely, the very
bad prediction capabilities for Δgrr1 are likely related
with the pleiotropic role of Grr1 in nutrient sensing, and
the fact that our model does not account for all the
regulatory effects associated with Grr1. Somewhere in
between, true predictions for Δmig1 ,Δmig1Δmig2 and
Δsnf1Δsnf4 lay in the range 50% –63%. These prediction
rates can be improved if we do not account for genes
with dubious regulation. Namely, the genes HXT5 ,
HXT8 ,YGL157W ,YKR075C ,YOR062C ,YNL234W and
theMAL loci were included in the model even toughlittle is known about their regulation. These genes are
presumably regulated by one or two of the transcription
factors in the model via a hypothesized mechanism (see
Additional file 1), but may very well also be regulated via
other mechanisms, possibly involving other regulators.
Nevertheless, their inclusion in the model allows us to
see to what extent their expression is explained by the
proposed mechanism. We observed that, if thesedubiously regulated genes were not included for model
evaluation, the rate of correct predictions increased
m a r k e d l yi nt h ec a s eo f Δmig1 ,Δmig1Δmig2 and
Δsnf1Δsnf4 (see values in parenthesis in Table 1).
Moreover, if we exclude the genes with dubious
regulation mentioned above as well as the results from
the highly pleiotropic knockout of GRR1 , we observe an
improvement in the overall success rate from 60% to
71%. This suggests that the proposed mechanisms are
probably incomplete for these genes.
Overall, analyses of the discrepancies between model
predictions and transcriptome data hints at four main
sources of errors: (i) errors arising from imprecise
conversion of knowledge into logical representation,
(ii) errors inherent to the Boolean formalism, (iii) errors
arising from the discrete evaluation of experimental gene
expression data, and (iv) situations where high-through-
put data goes against literature-based knowledge.
Errors arising from imprecise conversion of knowledge into
logical representation. Many of the discrepancies found
in the model are originated from biological ambiguities
or from difficulties in translating biological behavior
into logical rules. For example, during evaluation of the
Δrgt1 results we saw that it was not trivial to describe in
Boolean terms the regulation of SNF3 and SUC2 by Mig1
and Mig2. In both cases, the error seems to arise from an
over-estimation of the importance of Mig2 repression.
Although Mig1 and Mig2 are believed to have somewhat
redundant roles as repressors, the Boolean formalism
does not make it easy to distinguish different levels of
regulation. Most notoriously, the model fails to predict
the response of the MAL genes (only 1/3 of the
predictions were correct, which is the same frequency
expected for a random model). In S. cerevisae theMAL
genes, that are required for utilization of maltose as
carbon source, co-locate in telomere-associated MAL
loci. Although there are five different MAL loci identified
[45] there is large variation s in terms of presence and
activity of these loci in different strains [35]. Moreover,
experimental studies suggest that different MAL loci are
regulated by distinct regulatory mechanisms, and, in
particular, the MAL6 locus has been reported to be
regulated differently than the MAL1 ,MAL2 and MAL4
loci [45, 46]. In the present work, network reconstruction
of the MAL system was based on investigations of theBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/7


MAL 6 locus [34, 45, 47]. How ever, during model
evaluation we made no distinction between different
alleles –e.g.MALR is used to represent all MAL activator
encoding genes, i.e. MAL 13,MAL 23,MAL 33,MAL 43 and
MAL 63 (cf. [48]). This generalization may be a major
reason for the very low prediction rates.
Errors inherent to the Boolean formalism. Another source
of discrepancies is the limited nature of the binary
Boolean model itself. In some cases, very steep response
curves for gene expression and protein activities are
observed, corresponding well with the binary nature of
the Boolean model. However, the Boolean formalism
lacks the capacity to describe a continuous reality that
cannot be represented in an on/off manner. For example,
it is impossible to distinguish between absence, low
levels and high levels of glucose, three different condi-
tions that trigger different regulatory responses. Thus, a
discretionary approximation that conveniently explains
t h eb i o l o g i c a lc o n t e x th a st ob em a d e( e . g . ,f o rt h e
Δsnf1Δsnf4 evaluation, low levels of glucose in a carbon-
limited chemostat were appr oximated by a situation of
absence of glucose). In other instances, the Boolean
formalism may not be sensitive enough to represent
different levels of expression, such as in the case of
regulation of GAL1 by Mig1, Gal4 and Gal80 [49, 50].
Furthermore, when considering inducible proteins that
are expressed at a basal level, a value of zero may
indicate presence at basal level rather than total absence.In such instances, defining whether a gene is being
expressed (1) or not (0) is somewhat subjective. A
further limitation of the Boolean formalism, particularly
when focusing on logical steady state analysis with no
distinction between processes of different time scales, is
the difficulty of incorporating negative feedback loops.
As discussed above there are difficulties in representing
the negative feedback loop regulating MTH1 expression,
and it is also impossible to represent Mig1 repression of
theMIG1 gene. Such auto-repres sion cannot be included
by an AND-relationship, since MIG1 (and Mig1) would
then never be active in a logical steady state.
Errors arising from the discrete evaluation of experimental
gene expression data. Conversion of gene expression
changes into discrete Boolean values is a simplification,
which is presumably prone to errors. Nevertheless, we
used commonly accepted thresholds of fold-change and
significance to decide whether a gene is changing its
expression. We have also checked whether choosing
different aand FC
mingreatly impacts model evaluation
results (results not shown), and observed that it does
not. We have identified a number of discrepancies likely
to be due to type-2 errors when assigning experimental
variation (e.g., MIG2 and HXT8 in the Δrgt1 case, and
CAT8 and SIP4 in the Δsnf1Δsnf4 case), which show aregulatory change in the expected direction although
statistically is not significant. However, one must look
into these errors carefully, especially when the signifi-
cance of the experimental change is calculated based on
a high number of replicates, since this may hint at an
error in the underlying hypothesis instead of a type-2
gene expression error.
Situations where high-th roughput data goes against
literature-based knowledge. Large errors found in the
model evaluation (|Y imod-Yiexp|=2 )i n d i c a t es i t u a t i o n s
where model prediction and observed changes of gene
expression have opposite signs. This type of error
represents a situation where the hypothesis underlying
the logical model needs to be reconsidered. We have
found this type of error only 3 times (for GAL4 and
MAL13 inΔmig1 ,MAL33 inΔsnf1Δsnf4) .I nt h ec a s eo f
the MAL genes, we have already discussed probable
sources of the wrong predict ions, namely the incorrect
assumption about the regulatory mechanisms control-
ling the expression of the MAL loci. For the GAL4 gene,
we have observed that gene expression from the Δmig1
transcriptome study directly contradicts other studies.
Although more careful analysis may be advisable, it is
likely this result arises from the microarray experiment
itself, either due to a problem with the array hybridiza-
tion or with the normalization method used at probe-
sets level.
Conclusion
Overall, the Boolean model showed some potential as apredictive model. The overall success rate (60% for the
entire model, 71% for the restricted model without genesof dubious regulation and without considering deletion
of highly pleiotropic GRR1 )i sp r o m i s i n g .T h eo b s e r v e d
errors are most likely due to a combination of lack of
knowledge on the glucose regulatory network and
simplifications required b y the Boolean formalism. In
this regard it should be noted that the deterministic and
binary approximation to reality inherent in the Boolean
formalism demands careful interpretation of model
outputs and limits the overall success rate, which may
be achieved. Even though there is much information on
glucose repression in yeast, it is clear from our analysis
that there are still connections and parts that are missing.
Since the model is set up rigorously based on data from
the literature, these inconsistencies seem to be caused by
a combination of contradictions in reported experimen-
tal results and perhaps due to incorrect insights about
the network topology. Future efforts in modeling of
glucose repression may need to take into consideration
the uncertainties concerni ng the connectivity of the
regulatory network, as well as network dynamics.
Methods to discern these regulatory uncertainties (forBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/7


example, through the identification of the most probable
regulatory pathway from a set of different mechanistic
pathway models), moreover have the potential to be
used for reverse engineering of signaling and regulatory
networks. Nevertheless, the model presented here
represents a condensed way of organizing regulatory
information on glucose repression, and strongly facil-
itates integration and evaluation of new hypotheses. It
can also serve as the basis for further efforts in modeling
glucose repression signalin g and regulatory pathways
using probabilistic and/or dynamic approaches. The
model presented here is thus an important step towards
a holistic understanding of glucose repression in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and the model may further be
used for design of new experiments that can lead to a
better understanding of this complex regulatory system.
Methods
Network reconstruction and logical model representation
Glucose repression signaling and regulatory network was
reconstructed from low-throughput data, namely from
biochemical studies and physiological observations
reported in peer-reviewed, original research publications.
All information found relevant regarding glucose repres-
sion regulatory cascades was collected in a database
specifying the species involved (genes, proteins and
metabolites) and the type of regulation exerted among
them. This information was then converted into a logical
hypergraph, representing all interactions between species
in a logical manner, according to the framework
proposed by K l a m te ta l . [17]. In our context, a
hypergraph is a generalized unipartite directed graph
representation of an interaction network where eachedge (also called hyperarc or hyperedge) connects a set
of start-nodes (tails) to a set of end-nodes (heads). Here,
we consider graphs with one or more start-nodes, but
with a single end-node. Nodes represent the different
species (genes, proteins or metabolites) and hyperarcs
represent the signal flow between species. A logical
hypergraph is a hypergraph where hyperarcs are repre-
sented by Boolean (or logical) equations (Figure 2),
meaning that the state of an end-node can be determi-
nistically found from the state of start-nodes based on
the defined Boolean function connecting these nodes.
Nodes can assume one of two logical states, on (1) and
off (0); a gene can be expressed (1) or not (0) (or, in a
more specialized case, be upregulated (1) or expressed at
a basal level (0)), a protein can be active (1) or not (0), a
metabolite can be available (1) or not (0). Logical states
represent a discrete approximation of a continuous
reality, for example, a discrete approximation of the
sigmoid curve dictated by the Hill equation used to
describe both gene expression and enzyme activity.
Furthermore, we notice that the hypergraphrepresentation of a Boolean network requires all logical
equations to be written in the so-called disjunctive
normal form, which uses exclusively AND, OR and NOT
operators [17] (Figure 2). All network interactions were
therefore converted into Boolean functions written in
disjunctive normal form, and logical rules were intro-
duced based on literature information. The hereby
reconstructed logical hypergraph can easily and unam-
biguously be converted to its underlying interaction
graph by splitting up hyperarcs with more than one tail.
Our logical hypergraph model represents sensing events
(metabolite –protein interactions), signaling cascades
(protein –protein interactions) and regulatory circuits
(protein –gene interactions) related with glucose
repression in S. cerevisiae . For analyses purposes, we
consider the sensing events (sugar availability) as the
input layer of the system, while the expression levels of
the gene nodes are the outputs used in the model
evaluation. Thus, by properly defining an initial state of
the input layer, we can determine the logical steady state
of all nodes in the system given the defined set of logical
rules underlying the hypergraph. Additionally, given an
input node and an output node, we can also perform a
number of structural analyses on the characteristics of
the pathways connecting them. All our functions are
time-independent, as we are only interested in logical
steady state solutions. Logical steady states analyses
simplify the hypergraph setup, since we do not need totake into consideration the different timescales of
different processes. Moreover, it allows the model steady
states solutions to be evaluated against data from steady
state chemostat cultivation or from the exponential
phase of a batch cultivation (where balanced growth
resulting in appearance of pseudo-steady-state can be
assumed).
Structural and logica l steady state analyses
of the network
We used the MATLAB toolbox CellNetAnalyzer 7.0 [17,
51] to perform structural and functional logical steady
state analyses on the established network. Structural
analyses (number of loops and dependency matrix) were
performed on the underlying interaction graph derived
from the hypergraph. We used CNA capabilities to
analyze the overall number of positive and negative
loops between all input nodes and output nodes. We
also determined the dependency matrix, which sum-
marizes the relationship between all ordered pairs of
species in the network. The dependency matrix is based
solely on the topology of the interaction matrix and does
not incorporate information on Boolean relationships
[17, 51], i.e. while the dependency matrix may tell us
that A is an activator of B, it does not tell us whetherBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/7


species C must be present for the activation to take place.
Each matrix element, D ij, tells us whether the network
contains (1) only activating paths, (2) only inhibiting
paths, or (3) both activating and inhibiting paths,
between species iand j. In addition, it tells us whether
negative feedback loops exist that may attenuate the
predicted (1) activating or (2) down-regulatory effects (if
this is the case, species iis referred to as a non-total
activator or inhibitor). The dependency matrix thus
summarizes information on network topology in a very
condensed way. It was particularly helpful in setting up
the underlying interaction graph, and in identifying parts
of the network that were inconsistent with information
in the literature.
Logical steady state calculations were performed based
on the logical hypergraph representation. Briefly, the
logical steady state is the Boolean state that the system
eventually reaches given a fixed input (see [17] for
detail). We used CNA to determine the logical steady
state of all nodes in the system under all logical
combinations of sugars availability (glucose, galactose,
and/or maltose), and for all single gene deletions and
some double gene deletions. In general, all nodes (except
the input layer) are by default unconstrained. A few
species were given a default value of 1 (genes where no
other regulation is considered and genes expressed at
basal levels). Gene deletion s (i.e., knockouts) were
simulated by setting the state of the deleted gene to afix value of 0. Finally, specific edges were ignored in
logical steady state analysis if the corresponding regula-
tory interactions were comparably weak.
Model evaluation for knockouts
F o rs o m eo ft h ek n o c k o u t sw ew e r ea b l et oe v a l u a t emodel predictions with available gene expression data
from transcriptome studies. We used the results from the
logical steady state analyses for the corresponding
conditions in order to calculate the changes in gene
expression between the simulated wild-type and the
simulated knockout mutant. For wild-type simulations
we obtained, for each species i, a Boolean state X
i,WTŒ
{0,1}. Similarly, each knockout simulations produces a
logical state X i,KOŒ{0,1}. The variation between these
two conditions is given by the difference Y imod=( X i,KO-
Xi,WT), with Y imodŒ{-1,0,1}. If species iis a gene
(transcript), then Y imodcan be compared with experi-
mental differential gene expression data, and such
comparison allow us to evaluate the predictive capability
of the model. Thus, we used the available transcriptome
data in order to convert experimental gene expression
changes for each gene iinto a discrete number Y iexpŒ
{-1,0,1}, based on their significance of change ( p-value
from a Student's t-test) and fold change (defined as FC ="average expression of gene iin knockout"/"average
expression of gene iin wild-type" if "ave rage expression
of gene iin knockout" = "average expression of gene iin
wild-type", otherwise FC = -1 × "average expression of
gene iin wild-type"/"avera ge expression of gene iin
knockout"). We established a fold-change threshold
([FC min| = 1.5) and a Student's t-test p-value cut-off ( a=
0.05) for all pair-wise gene expression comparisons
between a deletion mutant and its isogenic reference
strain (i.e., wildtype). All genes with p-value < aand FC
≥FCmin(or FC ≤-FC min) were assigned with a value of
Yiexp=1( o rY iexp=- 1 ) ,a n d0o t h e r w i s e .O v e r a l l ,t h e
model prediction capabilites were evaluated based on
the difference |Y imod-Y iexp|, a value of 0 meaning a
correct prediction, a value of 1 implying a small error,
and a value of 2 indicating a large error (model
prediction and experimental results in opposite
directions).
Evaluation of predictive power
The capabilities of the model to make predictions were
evaluated in terms of the achieved percentage of correct
predictions and by testing the results against the values
expected from a model making random predictions. For
each knockout evaluation, the ratio of correct predictions
was calculated as the ratio of the number of genes where
|Yimod-Yiexp| = 0, divided by the total number of genes
evaluated against experimental gene expression data. In
order to remove uncertainty, we also determined the
percentage of correct predictions excluding dubiousinteractions. The model predictions were statistical
evaluated in order to assess the probability of having
correct predictions by chance, a high number indicating
a very bad predictive model. In order to do so, our model
predictions were tested against a random model using
the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.
Specifically, using a one-sided alternative, we tested the
null hypothesis that the proportion of correct predic-
tions by the model, p = X/n (X being the number of
successes and n being the total sample size, i.e. the
number of genes tested), is equal to that expected from
the random model, p
0. The statistic used is:
ZXn p
np p=−
−0
010 ()
which is a random variable approximated by the
standard normal distribution [52].

Abstract
CD4+ T cells orchestrate the adaptive immune response in vertebrates. While both experi-
mental and modeling work has been conducted to understand the molecular genetic mech-anisms involved in CD4+ T cell responses and fate attainment, the dynamic role of intrinsic(produced by CD4+ T lymphocytes) versus extrinsic (produced by other cells) componentsremains unclear, and the mechanistic and dynamic understanding of the plastic responsesof these cells remains incomplete. In this work, we studied a regulatory network for the coretranscription factors involved in CD4+ T cell-fate attainment. We first show that this core is
not sufficient to recover common CD4+ T phenotypes. We thus postulate a minimal Boolean
regulatory network model derived from a larger and more comprehensive network that isbased on experimental data. The minimal network integrates transcriptional regulation, sig-naling pathways and the micro-environment. This network model recovers reported configu-rations of most of the characterized cell types (Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Th9, iTreg, andFoxp3-independent T regulatory cells). This transcriptional-signaling regulatory network isrobust and recovers mutant configurations that have been reported experimentally. Addi-tionally, this model recovers many of the plasticity patterns documented for different T CD4+ cell types, as summarized in a cell-fate map. We tested the effects of various micro-envi-ronments and transient perturbations on such transitions among CD4+ T cell types. Inter-estingly, most cell-fate transitions were induced by transient activations, with the oppositebehavior associated with transient inhibitions. Finally, we used a novel methodology wasused to establish that T-bet, TGF- βand suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins are
keys to recovering observed CD4+ T cell plastic responses. In conclusion, the observedCD4+ T cell-types and transition patterns emerge from the feedback between the intrinsic

Author Summary
CD4+ T cells orchestrate adaptive immune responses in vertebrates. These cells differenti-
ate into several types depending on environmental signals and immunological challenges.Once these cells are committed to a particular fate, they can switch to different cell types,
thus exhibiting plasticity that enables the immune system to dynamically adapt to novel
challenges. We integrated available experimental data into a large network that was for-mally reduced to a minimal regulatory module with a sufficient set of components and in-
teractions to recover most CD4+ T cell types and reported plasticity patterns in response
to various micro-environments and transient perturbations. We formally demonstratethat transcriptional regulatory interactions are not sufficient to recover CD4+ T cell types
and thus propose a minimal network that induces most observed phenotypes. This model
is robust and was validated with mutant CD4+ T phenotypes. The model was also used toidentify key components for cell differentiation and plasticity under varying immunogenicconditions. The model presented here may be a useful framework to study other plastic
systems and guide therapeutic approaches to immune system modulation.
Introduction
The immune system protects organisms against external agents that may cause various types ofdiseases. As the immune system mounts specialized responses to diverse pathogens, it relies on
plastic responses to changing immunological challenges. At the same time, the immune systemmust maintain homeostasis and avoid auto-immune responses. Therefore, the immune systemrelies on resilience mechanisms that enable it to return to basal conditions once pathogens or
immunogenic factors are no longer present [ 1–3].
CD4+ T cells, also known as T helper (Th) cells, are key in the response to infectious agents
and in the plasticity of the immune system. Naive CD4+ T cells (Th0) are activated when they
recognize an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ. Depending on the cytokine milieu and
other signals in their micro-environment, CD4+ T cells attain different cell fates [ 2,4–7]. None-
theless, we still do not have a complete understanding of the dynamic mechanisms underlying
CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity [ 5].
Each CD4+ T cell type is associated with specific cytokines, receptors, transcription factors
and functions ( Fig 1 ). Th1 cells express T-bet, secrete interferon- γ(IFN- γ) and are associated
with cellular immunity [ 8]. Th2 cells express GATA3, secrete interleukin (IL)-4 and are associ-
ated with immunity to parasites [ 8]. Th17 cells express ROR αand ROR γt, secrete IL-17 and
IL-21, and are associated with neutrophil activation [ 9–10]. Follicular helper CD4+ T cells
(Tfh) express Bcl6 and CXCR5, secrete IL-21 and are associated with B cell maturation in ger-
minal centers [ 11,12]. Th9 cells secrete IL-9 and exert anticancer activity [ 13,14]. Induced regu-
latory T cells express Foxp3, secrete TGF- βand/or IL-10, and are associated with immune
tolerance [ 15,16]. There is also considerable overlap among the expression profiles of different
CD4+ T cells. For example, IL-9 and IL-10 can be secreted by Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg cells and a
variety of other immune cells [ 17–19]. T regulatory cells can also express IL-17 [ 20].

CD4+ T cells are highly plastic, switching from one type to another in response to environ-
mental challenges ( Fig 1 )[1,21–23]. Th17 cells can transform into Th1 cells [ 24–25], and
iTregs differentiate into Th17 in the presence of IL-6 [ 26]. Th2 cells can become IL-9 produc-
ing cells but may not easily become Th1 cells [ 27]. iTreg and Tfh cells can independently devel-
op into other CD4+ T cell types, and they can be derived from Th1, Th2 or Th17 cells [ 28–30].
The differentiation and plasticity of CD4+ T cells depends on the interactions among the cyto-
kines produced by other immune cells, epithelial cells, adipocytes, or by the CD4+ T cellsthemselves; the transduction of those signals and the regulation of this signaling by suppressors
of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins; the set of transcription factors expressed inside the
cells; epigenetic regulation; certain metabolites; and also microRNAs [ 4,6,31–33]. Given the
Fig 1. Differentiation and plasticity of CD4+ T cell types. CD4+ T cell types are characterized by their unique cytokine production profiles, transcription
factors and biological functions. The main cell types are Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg and Tfh. Other possible cell types have been described such as IL-9
(Th9), IL-10+Foxp3-(Tr1) and TGF- β+Foxp3-(Th3) producing cells.

complexity of CD4+ T cell transitions and the difficulty of classifying a particular expression
pattern as a subset or a lineage, we will refer to the different stable expression patterns of CD4
+ T cells as “cell-types ”.
A mechanistic, integrative and system-level understanding of CD4+ T cell differentiation
and plasticity requires dynamic regulatory network models that consider the concerted action
of many components. These models can be used to prove whether the known biological inter-
actions are necessary and sufficient to recover attractors that correspond to experimentally ob-served configurations in different CD4+ T cell types. Additionally, such models may be used to
address whether the considered components and interactions also restrict and explain the ob-
served patterns of transition among cell types. Finally, this type of model can be used to test therole of different network components in cell differentiation and plasticity.
In such regulatory network models, the nodes correspond to the regulatory components of
the network such as genes, proteins or signals, while the links correspond to the interactionsamong components. The state of each node is determined by the expression level of its regula-
tors, and the logical functions describe the dynamic evolution of the node states. The attractors,
the states to which such regulatory networks converge, can be interpreted as the profiles char-acterizing different cell types (see reviews in: [ 34–36]).
Previous studies have used regulatory network models to study CD4+ T cell differentiation
and plasticity [ 37–40]. These models captured the dynamic and non-linear regulation of CD4
+ T cells and recovered the attractors corresponding to the Th0, Th1, Th2, iTreg and Th17 celltypes. They have also been useful for preliminary studies of CD4+ T cell plasticity in the pres-
ence of different cytokines in the micro-environment [ 38] and fir studies of the effect of a spe-
cific molecule (PPAR γ) in the Th17/iTreg switch [ 40]. However, as new T CD4+ cell types
such as Tfh, regulatory Foxp3-independent, Th9, and Th22 cells are described, it is necessary
to develop an updated regulatory network that is able to recover the configurations that charac-
terize such novel cell subsets. Additionally, to date no minimal model that incorporates thenecessary and sufficient set of interactions to also recover the reported patterns of transitionsamong Th cells has been reported.
Here, we specifically address whether CD4+ cell types and their transition patterns emerge
as a result of the feedback between a minimal regulatory core of intra-cellular transcription fac-tors and cytokines produced by the CD4+ T cell together with cytokines produced by other
cells present in the micro-environment. Our results confirm that a regulatory network model
that only considers the interactions among the master transcription factors is not sufficient torecover configurations that characterize the different CD4+ T cell types. Therefore, we then in-
tegrated a minimal network of master transcriptional factors with cytokine signaling pathway,
including the cytokines produced by the cell and those present in the micro-environment, tointegrate a network with the necessary and sufficient set of components to recover documented
CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity patterns. The observed configurations of CD4+ T
cells (Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg, Tfh, Th9 and Foxp3-independent T regulatory cells) emergefrom the feedback and cooperative dynamics among the multiple levels of regulation consid-ered in the minimal model. In addition, this system is able to recover the plastic transition pat-
terns and stability behavior that have been described for the different cell types in response to
transitory perturbations and different micro-environments. Interestingly, our model predictsthat transitions from particular cell types to others are caused by transient activations, while
transient inhibitions usually cause cells to remain in their original cell types. Additionally, we
show that T-bet, TGF- βand SOCS proteins are keys to recovering observed CD4+ T cell plastic
responses. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our models for a system-level understanding of
mammalian immunological responses and eventual biomedical interventions.

Results
CD4+ T cell regulatory network
Boolean networks are capable of integrating qualitative interactions (molecular, physical,
chemical, etc.) into a coherent picture and are useful ways to explore the minimal set of restric-tions that are necessary and sufficient to produce emergent biological patterns and behaviors
[41–43]. The regulatory interactions considered in the present model are grounded on experi-
mental data. In the proposed regulatory network, the nodes represent the regulatory compo-nents of the network and the links the interactions among them ( S1 Table andS1 Fig ). Given
the complexity of the network, we simplified the model by removing intermediate components
along a network path ( S1 File ) following a method proposed in [ 44] and checked the consisten-
cy of the reduced network using GINsim [ 45].
The predicted cell phenotypes arising from the steady states of the network are consistent
with the available experimental data [ 2,4–7]. The model assumes that all interactions are syn-
chronous, that all cytokine receptors are present, and that the TCR and its cofactors are activat-ed (being unable to model unactivated and anergic CD4+ T cells). The model ignores weak
interactions, low levels of expression, and epigenetic regulation ( S1 File ).
A core of master transcriptional regulators is not sufficient to explain
CD4+ T cell differentiation
To address whether a minimal transcriptional regulatory core could recover the observed con-
figurations that characterize the main CD4+ T cell types that have been described up to now,
we extracted from the general network under study a minimal regulatory module consisting
only of transcriptional regulators ( Fig 2A ,S2 Table , BioModels Database:
MODEL1411170000). Our aim was to test whether this minimal module contained a sufficient
set of interactions to predict the observed configurations for the transcription factors included
in the model that characterize different CD4+ T cell types. The nodes of the transcriptional

experimental data we constructed a CD4+ T cell regulatory network that includes the master transcriptional
regulators and the interactions among those regulators (CD4+ T TRN). (A)Graph of the CD4+ T TRN. Node

be recovered.

regulatory network (TRN) correspond to the five “master ”transcription factors associated with
CD4+ T cell types: T-bet for Th1, GATA3 for Th2, ROR γt for Th17, Foxp3 for iTreg, and Bcl6
for Tfh.
The dynamic analysis of this TRN recovered attractors corresponding to different CD4+ T
cell types ( Fig 2B ): Th0, Th1, Th2, iTreg and the hybrid states T-bet+Foxp3+ [ 46] and GATA3
+Foxp3+ [ 47]. However, this TRN did not converge to configurations that characterize the
Th17 and Tfh cell types, implying that the expression of ROR γt and Bcl6 is not sufficient to
maintain such cell types. This result may be caused by the lack of feed-forward loops in the
TRN. ROR γt has no positive interactions with any of the transcription factors considered in
the TRN and lacks a feedback loop mediated by transcription factors [ 48]. The mode of self-
regulation of Bcl6 remains unclear, as it has been reported to either activate or inhibit its own
expression in B cells [ 49–50].
CD4+ T cell differentiation patterns emerge from feedback between the
transcriptional regulatory network, cytokines and signaling pathways
The above result reveals which T CD4+ cell types rely only on the postulated TRN and which
require extrinsic signals. To formally test this hypothesis, we extended the TRN network by in-
troducing key components of signaling pathways and their regulators, as well as cytokines thathave been shown to be fundamental in CD4+ T cell type attainment. This T CD4+ cell tran-scriptional-signaling regulatory network (TSRN) was then simplified ( S1 File ,S1 Fig ) to obtain
a minimal network. To reduce the number of nodes in the network, we assumed that the TCR
signal was present and that the cytokine receptors were present in sufficient amounts to trans-duce a signal. This network lacks many important inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1,
TNFα), because while these cytokines are crucial for the immune response, they are dispens-
able for CD4+ T cell differentiation. The model analyzed in this paper also lacks extrinsic cyto-kines produced by other immune system cells and other cell types such as IL-12 and IL-18. The
network also lacks some transcription factors and cytokines associated with newly reported Th
types such as IL-22, as detailed experimental information linking them to the network modelunder analysis is not yet available.
The nodes of the simplified TSRN represent ( Fig 3A ,S3 Table , BioModels Database:
MODEL1411170001) transcription factors, signaling pathways and extrinsic cytokines. The
nodes corresponding to cytokine pathways are active if the signal is transduced; this meansthat if the cytokine is present, it forms a complex with the receptor that can activate a messen-
ger molecule (for example a STAT protein), which is then translocated to the nucleus. Cyto-
kines can be produced by both CD4+ T cells (intrinsic) and by other cells of the immunesystem and the organism (extrinsic). To resolve this ambiguity we added nodes representing
the extrinsic cytokines produced by other cells and tissues of the immune system (IL_e). This
extended TSRN includes 18 nodes: the transcription factors (Tbet, GATA3, ROR γt, Foxp3,
Bcl6), the effector cytokines and their signaling pathways (IFN- γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-21, IL-9), the
regulatory cytokines (TGF- βand IL-10) and the extrinsic cytokines (IFN- γe, IL-2e, IL-4e, IL-
21e, TGF- βe and IL-10e). While IL-10, IL-6 and IL-21 all signal using STAT3, IL-6 and IL-21
cause inflammation, while IL-10 suppresses inflammation. To analyze this network, we assumethat IL-10 signaling was mediated by a different pathway than IL-6/IL-21, even though they
share STAT3 as a messenger molecule. The production of these external cytokines is indepen-
dent of regulation inside the CD4+ T cell, but their signaling can be blocked (for example bySOCS proteins [ 51]). The resulting network includes two levels of regulation, the regulation in
the nucleus by mutually inhibiting transcription factors and the regulation among the receptors
and their signal transduction pathways mediated by SOCS proteins.

The dynamic analysis of the TSRN yields stable configurations that correspond to: Th0,
Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg, Tfh, T regulatory Foxp3-independent cells, Th1R, Th2R and GATA3
+IL4- cells ( Fig 3B ). As this biological patterns can be obtained in the presence of various ex-
trinsic cytokines, we labeled each attractor according to the active transcription factors andintrinsic cytokines. Resting CD4+ T cells (labeled Th0) were defined as expressing no tran-
scription factors or regulatory cytokines. Th1 was defined as Tbet and IFN- γactive [ 8], Th2 as
GATA3 and IL-4 active [ 8] and GATA3+ (a Th2-like cell type) as GATA3+IL4-[ 38]. Th17 was
defined based on ROR γt and STAT3 signaling mediated by IL-6 or IL-21, all of which require
the presence of TGF- βe[9–10]. iTreg expressed Foxp3 and TGF- β, IL-10 or both, all of which
require the presence of IL-2e [ 16]. Interestingly, the TSRN model also predicts a novel set of
steady states that had not been predicted by previous models but that correspond to reported
biological cell types ( Fig 3B ); for example, Tfh cells with Bcl6 and STAT3 signaling mediated
by IL-21 [ 12]; Th9 cells with IL-9, requiring the presence of TGF- βand extrinsic IL-4 [ 27]; T
regulatory cells, as Foxp3-independent CD4+ T cells (TrFoxp3-) with TGF- β, IL-10 or both,
but not Foxp3 [ 52]; Th1 regulatory cells (Th1R) expressing a regulatory cytokine and T-bet
[46]; and Th2 regulatory cells (Th2rR) expressing a regulatory cytokine and GATA3 [ 47]. The
model does not consider the Th22 cell type [ 53] because IL-22 was not included in the network
due to the lack of experimental data on this molecule.
To validate the model with experimental data, we simulated loss and gain of function alter-
ations for some nodes. In general, the results agree with the available experimental data, exceptin the case of the IL-2 knock-out. IL-2- causes the loss of iTreg cells as these cells require con-
tinuous IL-2 signaling [ 54,55], but this differs from the actual IL-2 KO mutants, which lose
most CD4+ T cell types because IL-2 is also critical for the activation and survival of CD4+ Tcells. This model also allows us to predict the behavior of the Tr Foxp3-, Th1R and Th2R cell
types in response to various knock-out and over-expression simulations for several transcrip-
tion factors or signaling pathways where no experimental data are available.
We performed a functional robustness analysis in which the logical functions of the network
were altered ( S2 Fig ) to verify the construction of the functions and the structural properties of
the model and to avoid over-fitting. Altering one of the functions of the network resulted in
1.389% of the initial states attaining a different final attractor than the original final state, andonly 0.219% of the initial states arrived at an attractor that was not in the original set of attrac-
tors of the non-altered network.
To further verify that the results of the Boolean network are not an artifact due to the dis-
crete nature of the model and to further assess the robustness of the attractors to variations in
the node values, we approximated the discrete step-like functions of the Boolean model with
continuous interaction functions [ 44](S2 File ). The continuous model recovers the same at-
tractors as the Boolean regulatory network. Furthermore, these attractors are stable in response
to small perturbations in the value of the nodes as predicted by the robustness analyses of the
Boolean version of the model.
CD4+ T cell differentiation in response to the micro-environment
Cytokines can be produced by the cell (intrinsic) or by other cells of the immune system (ex-trinsic). These extrinsic cytokines constitute the micro-environment for CD4+ T cell differenti-
ation. The role of polarizing micro-environments in CD4+ T cell differentiation was assessed
using the TSRN model. In this network, the values of the extrinsic cytokines were fixed at agiven expression level and the network response was analyzed again ( Fig 4 ). Th0, Th1, Th2 and
Tfh can be maintained in the absence of extrinsic cytokines or in the presence of effector cyto-
kines such as IFN- γ, IL-2, IL-4 or IL-21. Th17, iTreg and Th9 cells require extrinsic TGF- β, IL-

2 and IL-4, respectively, to maintain their homeostatic states [ 13,56]. TrFoxp3- states can be
maintained in most polarizing micro-environments [ 57,58]. The recovered behaviors agree
with the experimental data and also with previous models [ 38].
The importance of the extrinsic cytokines present in the micro-environment can be further
analyzed when the system is studied under polarizing conditions. The presence of extrinsic sig-
nals for a given cell type increases the number of initial states that differentiate into that celltype, while the absence of extrinsic signals may lead to the loss of a cell type, as is the case withTh17, iTreg and Th9 cells ( Fig 4 ). The presence of the regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF- β
inhibits most effector CD4+ T cells, except for Th17. This finding may explain the presence of
Th17 cells in regulatory micro-environments [ 59] and provides important insight concerning
the relationship between Th17 and iTreg. Thus, this type of modeling framework and analysis
may prove useful for finding therapeutic approaches to chronic inflammation.
The polarization of the micro-environment towards a particular cell type increases the size of
the basin of attraction and its resistance to transient perturbations. Basin size and attractor stabil-
ity are not identical ( S3 Fig ). In this way, the environmental signals promote specific cell types
and increase their stability, which likely affects the population dynamics of CD4+ T cells. None-theless, different CD4+ T cell types coexist during immune responses. Even if the signals in the
micro-environment promote a specific cell type, attractors corresponding to other cell types can
still appear in this micro-environment, but their basin sizes and stability tend to be smaller.
CD4+ T cell plasticity in response to the micro-environment
The ability of the immune system to dynamically respond to environmental challenges de-pends on its plastic responses. CD4+ T cells are phenotypically plastic, and once differentiated,

model. The values of the extrinsic signals of the TSRN were fixed according to different polarizing micro-
environments. The basins of attraction of the resulting attractors were plotted on a logarithmic scale. The
following micro-environments were studied: combinations of all extrinsic cytokines, no extrinsic cytokines
(Th0), IFN- γe (Th1), IL-4e and IL-2e (Th2), IL-21e and TGF- βe (Th17), TGF- βe and IL-2e (iTreg), IL-10e

their expression patterns can be altered depending on internal and external cues. This cell plas-
ticity seems to be important for the overall plasticity of immune system responses [ 1].
To analyze CD4+ T cell plasticity, we transiently perturbed the attractors of the system. For
each attractor we altered the value of one of its nodes and then evaluated the system until an at-tractor was reached. If the original attractor was reached, we considered the corresponding cell
type as stable towards that perturbation. If a new cell-type was reached, we considered that the
transition from one cell type to another corresponded to phenotypic plasticity. This analysiswas repeated for every node and every attractor. This methodology allowed us determine all
the transitions between cell types, the specific perturbation that caused the transition, and the
path from one cell-type to another. These transient perturbations in the values of the nodes areequivalent to developmental noise or temporal changes in the micro-environment of the cell.
The result is a cell-fate map where the nodes represent CD4+ T cell types recovered by the
TSRNand the connections represent the possible transitions between pairs of differentiated celltypes ( Fig 5 ,S3 File ).
The model recovers the reported transitions corresponding to the polarization of naïve CD4
+ T cells into canonical CD4+ T cell types, as well as various events of trans-differentiation be-tween canonical CD4+ T cell types. Most of the predicted transitions are to or from Th0 or to-wards TrFoxp3-. It is important to clarify that the TCR complex was not included in the
minimal model. Thus, in our model, the Th0 attractor represents resting CD4+ T cells. There
are few direct transitions among the Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell types. The few direct transitionsfound towards iTreg and Tfh can only be achieved in polarizing micro-environments. It is also
possible to transition from one of the main cell types to another one through the Th0,
TrFoxp3-, Th1R, Th2R or GATA3+IL4- attractors. This ability raises multiple questions aboutthe signals necessary for plasticity in vivo . It is possible that in order to transition from one cell
type to another, some signals have to be maintained for a certain period of time, or that more
than one perturbation is necessary. Further studies are required to determine which conditionsare necessary and sufficient for CD4+ T cell type transitions to further understand CD4+ Tcell plasticity.
Therefore, in the context of this study, we define plasticity as the potential of a given differ-
entiated cell to attain other fates in response to alterations in the expression patterns of their in-trinsic components and/or of the extrinsic micro-environment. Of the total of 121 possible
transitions between cell types arising from those alterations, the TSRN network yielded 66 cell-
type transitions. Thus, the topology or set of regulatory interactions proposed in this networkgenerates restrictions in terms of cell types but also in terms of the patterns of cell-fate
transitions.
CD4+ T cells are typically under the influence of particular micro-environments, with spe-
cific cytokines affecting the dynamics of these cells. Depending on the combination of cyto-
kines, some cell types are lost, and transitions among the remaining cell types are also
restricted. To simulate polarizing micro-environments, we fixed the value of the cytokines as-sociated with pro-Th1 (IFG γe), pro-Th2 pro-(IL-4e, IL-2e), pro-Th17 (IL-21e, TGF- βe), pro-
iTreg (TGF- βe, IL-2e), pro-Tr (IL-10,) pro-Tfh (IL-21e) and pro-Th9 (IL-4 and TGF- βe). In
general, the polarizing micro-environment increases the size of the attraction basin, the stabili-
ty and the transition into the attractor. The biological nature of the polarizing signal affects thenature of the resulting transition. In response to regulatory signals (IL-10e, TGF- βe), the ma-
jority of the transitions are towards TrFoxp3-, while inflammatory signals lead to more transi-
tion signals towards Th1 and Th2. All of these results represent interesting predictions thatcould be tested experimentally.

is also important for CD4+ T cell plastic responses or stability ( Fig 6 ). If an inactive node is ac-
tivated (0 !1), there is a high probability that a transition from one cell type to another is in-
duced. In contrast, if an active node is inactivated (1 !0), there is a high probability that the
system remains in the original cell-type. This pattern may be caused by the topology of the net-
work and, in particular, may depend on the functional feedback loops of the system that are al-tered. The positive feedback loops of a cell type may increase the stability of an attractor andhelp to recover a transiently inactive node, thus stabilizing a given differentiated state. We hy-
pothesize that the activation of a previously inactive node may induce more transitions, as this
alteration likely affects the positive and negative functional circuits of the system [ 60], thus in-
creasing the chances that the system leads to a new attractor. Further simulations should be
used to exhaustively test how specific regulatory circuits react to transient activations and inhi-
bitions. In any case, the analysis presented in this study enables us to postulate that CD4+ Tcells are expected to be able to react to activation signals and environmental alterations but are
stabilized in response to the transient loss of signals. Thus, the proposed model for CD4+ T cell
dynamics implies that these cells are under an unstable equilibrium between cell-fate stabilityand plasticity.
Key nodes for CD4+ T transcriptional-signaling regulatory network
plasticity
While all the elements of the TSRN have previously been shown to be necessary for the differ-
entiation of CD4+ T cells, we wished to address their relative importance in cell plasticity re-
sponses. To evaluate this question, we perturbed each node of all the attractors and measuredhow many times the perturbed state changed to a new attractor ( Fig 7 ) and to which new cell
type the system converged ( S4 Fig ). This process is equivalent to the temporal activation or in-
activation of a transcription factor or an element of the signaling pathway in response to noise.
Alterations of T-bet and TGF- βusually caused the perturbed state to change from one attractor
to another, while ROR γt and IL-9 had the least effect on cell-fate transitions. In general, the
system is more sensitive to perturbations in the master transcriptional regulators than to alter-
ations of the cytokines.
Fig 6. Cell fate map in response to activating or inhibitory signals of the TSRN model. The attractors of
the network were transiently perturbed in all possible micro-environments. Perturbations were considered
activations (0 !1) when a previously inactive element was turned on, and inhibitions (1 !0) when a
previously active element was turned off. The nodes represent CD4+ T cell types, and the node sizescorrespond to the size of the basin of attraction. The edges represent transitions between cell types, the width
of the edges correspond to the number of times the transition occurred on the logarithmic scale. The number
of transitions towards a different or the original cell type were counted for both activations and inactivations.

In contrast to previously published T CD4+ network models that only included SOCS1
[37–40], several SOCS-type proteins were considered in the TSRN presented and analyzed
here. SOCS proteins are important for the differentiation and plasticity of CD4+ T cells.SOCS1 is commonly silenced in inflammatory diseases, and over-expression of SOCS3 corre-lates with allergies [ 31,51]. To explore the role of SOCS proteins and the impact of alterations
in these proteins on CD4+ T type transitions, we generated a network lacking the inhibitions
mediated by these proteins ( Fig 8 ). This altered system recovers the original attractors includ-
ing Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg, Tfh, TrFoxp3-, and Th9, but it also predicts novel attractors
expressing ROR γt+IL-10+ (Th17R) and GATA3+IL-10+IL-9+ (Th2RIL9+), thus confirming
the importance of SOCS proteins for attaining the Th17 and Th9 cell types. The importance ofIL-10 for CD4+ T cell plasticity dramatically increased in the altered network, while the impor-
tance of the rest of the molecular elements decreased. This result suggests that SOCS proteins
play an important role in stabilizing effector cell types and regulating the Th0 and TrFoxp3-cell types. SOCS proteins inhibit signal transduction; IL-10 in particular acts through these pro-
teins to regulate CD4+ T cells. This regulation is important to buffer the effect of extrinsic cyto-
kines in the TSRN network model. When SOCS proteins are absent, the network is moresensitive to changes in extrinsic cytokines and IL-10. Further analyses of the effects of SOCSproteins on CD4+ T cells and the possibility of updates to the model based on experimental
work should enable the evaluation of more subtle alterations in and combinations of SOCS
proteins.

Discussion
This model provides a mechanistic description of the way in which CD4+ T cell types and plas-
ticity emerge from the interactions among the intrinsic and extrinsic components of the im-mune response. The study formally shows that, as expected, the interactions among master
transcription factors considered in the TSRN are not sufficient to recover the configurations
characteristic of CD4+ T cell types, nor the reported transition patterns. Furthermore, these re-sults clearly demonstrate the necessity to include the feedback from signaling pathways in re-
sponse to cytokines to recover most of the range of CD4+ T cell types (Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17,
Tfh, Th9, iTreg and T regulatory Foxp3 independent cells) and their transition pathways.
As noted above, CD4+ T cell differentiation does not arise solely from the regulatory action
of the core of the reported "master" transcription factors (TF): T-bet, GATA3, Foxp3, ROR γt
and Bcl6. This may be due to the lack of feedforward loops mediated by the transcription fac-tors ROR γt[48] and Bcl6 [ 49,50]. These results show that the transcriptional regulatory core of
CD4+ T cell differentiation is necessary, but not sufficient for CD4+ T cell differentiation. The
emergence of the different CD4+ T cell types and their transition patterns, requires the feed-
back from cytokine signaling pathways and external cues.
This model provides a formal test for the emergence of different CD4+ T cell types from
feedback or cooperative dynamics among master transcriptional factors, signaling pathway, cy-
tokines produced by the cell and those present in the micro-environment. The proposed modelrecovers the observed configurations for the following CD4+ T cell types: Th0, Th1, Th2,
Th17, Tfh, Th9, iTreg and T regulatory Foxp3 independent cells [ 2,4–7]. The model also yields

study their role. (A)Cell fate map of CD4+ T cell types when the SOCS protein interactions are removed from the TSRN model. The nodes represent CD4+ T
cell types and the node sizes correspond to the size of the basin of attraction. New attractors corresponding to GATA3+IL9+IL10+ (Th2RTh9) and ROR γt+IL-
10+ (Th17R) appeared. The edges represent transitions between cell types, the width of the edges corresponds to the number of times the transition
occurred on logarithmic scale, and self-loops correspond to perturbations where the network returned to the original cell type. (B)Proportion of transitions

extrinsic cytokines.

the cell types Tfh, Th9 and T regulatory Foxp3 independent cells that had not been previously
incorporated into such models [ 37–40].
CD4+ T cell types depend on signals from other cells for their differentiation and mainte-
nance. The cytokines in the micro-environment restrict which cell types and transitions can beattained. A cytokine micro-environment that promotes a particular cell type increases its at-
traction basin size, stability and increases the number of transitions towards the promoted cell
type. Nonetheless, different CD4+ T cell types can coexist in micro-environments that do notpromote all the present cell types. For example, the presence of pro-regulatory cytokines IL-10
and TGF- βinhibits most effector cells, except for Th17. This finding may explain the presence
of Th17 cells in regulatory micro-environments [ 59] and provides important insights concern-
ing the relationship between Th17 and iTreg cells and the paradoxical role of TGF- βin inflam-
mation [ 61]. Thus, the type of modeling framework and analyses presented here may prove to
be useful for efforts to find therapeutic approaches to address chronic inflammation.
The model was also used to analyze the plasticity of CD4+ T cells by systematically testing
how transient perturbations affect the transition patterns among cell types under various
micro-environments. Previous studies focused on cell plasticity in response to different micro-environments [ 38] or on the role of specific molecules [ 40], rather than studying these phe-
nomena as consequences of the global properties of the system. For example, the TSRN faith-
fully captures the polarization of resting CD4+ T cells into Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg and
Foxp3-independent T cells, but the predicted cell-fate maps lack direct transitions from iTregto Th17 and Th17 to Th1 [ 23–25]. The TSRN model may lack components, interactions or epi-
genetic mechanisms of regulation that are important to enabling such direct transitions [ 33].
An additional possibility is that signals must be combined during particular lengths of time toenable some transitions. Further theoretical and experimental research is required to under-
stand the mechanisms underlying CD4+ T cell plasticity. However, the qualitative model pro-
posed here can serve as a framework to incorporate additional details involved in CD4+ Tplasticity.
Our model shows that the activation of specific CD4+ T cell transcriptional-signaling regu-
latory network nodes generally induce cell type plasticity while inhibitions induce stability. The
observed response patterns may be caused by the feedback loops and mutual inhibitions molec-ular network. These findings are coherent with the fact that the immune system generates a
specific immunological response to particular challenges, maintains this response while the
challenge remains present, and finally downregulates the immune response once the challengehas passed, thus maintaining homeostasis [ 3,61].
Our model suggests that T-bet, TGF- βand SOCS proteins are key network components to
recover the observed CD4+ T cell plasticity. Although T-bet is a key transcription factor forTh1, it also inhibits other transcription factors regulating the differentiation into different cell
types [ 4]. TGF- βis a critical regulator of the immune response but also plays a key role during
chronic inflammatory responses [ 61]. SOCS proteins regulate the phosphorylation of STAT
proteins, playing a key role in modulating the signal transduction among different cell types[31,51]. Determining the key elements enabling cell-type plasticity has possible therapeutic im-
plications, as these findings can help to identify therapeutic targets for modulating the immune
response while predicting and avoiding secondary effects[ 3,62].
Given the complexity of CD4+ T cell expression patterns and transitions, it remains unclear
whether cytokine expression profiles correspond to lineages or subsets [ 1–3,22]. The term line-
age implies the stability of the cellular phenotype and that the cell has committed to an expres-sion pattern and will maintain it in a fairly robust manner, regardless of environmental
alterations. On the other hand, the term subset implies that the cell has a specified expression
pattern but that extrinsic signals are required to maintain that pattern [ 1,22]. Cell types Th1,

Th2, Tfh and TrFoxp3- can be considered lineages, as they exhibit commitment under different
cytokine milieus, even if the extrinsic signals change, although environmental alterations can
still affect their stability. However, Th17, iTreg and Th9 cells, which require TGF- βe, IL-2e or
IL-4e respectively, are potentially subsets. Th17 and iTreg cells also have small basins of attrac-tion, low stability, and require extrinsic signals, exhibiting a lack of commitment. Th9 has a
larger basin of attraction than Th17 or iTreg, but is less stable and susceptible to environmental
alterations. Based on our analyses, we propose that the degree of dependence on extrinsic sig-nals and the stability in response to changes in the micro-environment can provide clearer and
more objective criteria to distinguish between CD4+ T cell subsets and lineages.
CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity arises from the feedback among multiple levels of
regulation: transcriptional regulation, signaling pathways and the micro-environment. Study-
ing the molecular network as a dynamic system allows us to understand how the interactions
among the components, the topology of the network, and the dynamic functions of the nodesgive rise to the biological behavior. However, further theoretical and experimental research is
required to understand CD4+ T cells. As our understanding of these cells improves, it will be
possible to incorporate more detailed molecular information, such as the effect of relative ex-pression levels and the characteristic time courses of expression in the system. This will, inturn, allow us to recover novel cell types and their relationship with other CD4+ T cell types
and other cells of the immune system. The present model can now be extended to incorporate
multiple cells and their population dynamics [ 39], relationships with other cells of the immune
system, and the formation of specialized niches that result from the dynamic interaction with
the micro-environment. This approach will allow us to differentiate between CD4+ T cell sub-
sets and lineages, to understand the developmental dynamics between the different cell types,and to propose approaches to immune system reprogramming that can be used in the clinic.
Methods
Logical modeling formalism: Boolean networks
CD4+ T cell differentiation results from interactions among cytokines, signaling pathways and
transcription factors. These interactions were modeled using Boolean networks that enabled us
to integrate the qualitative nature of complex regulatory systems. A Boolean network is com-
posed of nodes that represent the system´s molecular components (i.e., cytokines, signalingpathways or transcription factors). In a Boolean network, each node represents a component(gene, protein, phenomenological signal) that can be associated with a discrete variable denot-
ing its current functional level of activity. If the node is functional its value is 1, and if it is not
functional, then its value is 0 (see S1 File ). Some nodes required special considerations concern-
ing their activation states in the Boolean model. For example, in the case of GATA3, which is
continuously expressed during T-cell-lineage development and is necessary for lineage com-
mitment and maintenance, GATA3
lowis set to 0. As GATA3 is upregulated in Th2 differentia-
tion [ 63], we set GATA3highto 1. Another example concerns STAT proteins, which are
activated when the protein is phosphorylated, forming a dimer that translocates to the nucleus,
where it activates its target genes. In this case, the value for STAT protein activation was onlyset to 1 when all the required conditions were met.
The value of a node xi at a time t depends on the value of the input nodes (including itself),
referred to as its regulators. This value can be expressed with a logical function that describes
the behavior of the node through time:
x
iðtÞ¼ ϕιðτ;ξ1;ξ2;ξ2;…;ξι;…;ξνÞ:
CD4+ T Lymphocyte Minimal Regulatory Network
PLOS Computational Biology | DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004324 June 19, 2015 16 / 23
Weak interactions that are not necessary or sufficient, but only modulate a target factor,
were not included in the input regulators of the truth tables ( S1 File ). Such is the case for
Foxp3, which positively modulates the expression of IL-2R α, which can be activated and func-
tional in the absence of Foxp3 [ 64].
An input is a node that affects the values of the network but is independent of the network.
The state of the network S can be represented by a vector that specifies the value of each node.
The state of the network can be represented by a vector S composed of the values of all thenodes of the system. The state of the network corresponds to the expression patterns of a cell.
Inference of the regulatory functions. Boolean functions were defined based on the avail-
able experimental data for the reported interactions among a network of 85 components ( S1
Table ). A transcription factor regulates another factor if it binds to the regulatory region of the
latter factor and inhibits or activates is transcription. A cytokine is present if it is either secreted
by the cell (intrinsic) or produced by other cells of the immune system (extrinsic). To separatethe effects of the cytokines produced by the immune system from those of the cytokines pro-
duced by the CD4+ T cell, we label extrinsic cytokines as ILe. Receptors are considered to be ac-
tive when the cytokine is stably bound to a receptor, enabling it to transduce a signal. STATproteins are considered active when they are phosphorylated and capable of translocating tothe nucleus. The activation of a STAT protein depends on the presence of interleukin, its cor-
rect binding to the receptor, and subsequent phosphorylation. SOCS proteins inhibit the phos-
phorylation of STAT by competing for the phosphorylation site.
Model reduction
To facilitate the analysis of the network and determine which components were necessary andsufficient to recover observed profiles and their patterns of transition, we reduced the extendedregulatory network consisting of 85 nodes to one with 18 nodes, including 5 transcription fac-
tors, 7 signaling pathways and 6 extrinsic cytokines. To simplify the network, we assumed that
the signal produced by the TCR and its co-factors was constitutive and ignored weak interac-tions as well as input and output nodes. Considering that the expression level of node x
iat time
t is represented by x i(t), the attractors (steady states) that represent different phenotypes are de-
termined by: x i(t+1) = x i(t).
In that case, the mapping becomes a set of coupled Boolean algebraic equations. The explicit
expressions of the attractors are then obtained by performing the algebraic operations accord-
ing to the axioms of Boolean algebra [ 44]. Self-regulated nodes were not removed. If a node
was removed, then the logical rules of its targets were modified, maintaining the regulatorylogic and indirect regulation. To verify that we did not remove a necessary node, we recovered
the attractors of the network and ensured that the configurations corresponding to the Th0,
Th1, Th2, Th17 and iTreg states could still be attained (see the details of the reduction methodsused in S1 File ).
The reduction was verified using the GINsim[ 45] software. GINsim uses decision diagrams
to iteratively remove regulatory components and updates the components to maintain the indi-rect effects. This method preserves the dynamic properties of the original model. The simplifi-
cation with GINsim returned a similar network to the one that we obtained with the Boolean
logic reduction method proposed by Villareal et al. ([ 44];S1 File ).
Dynamic analysis
After inferring and simplifying the network, we studied its dynamic behavior. A regulatory net-
work is a dynamic system. The state of a network will change over time depending on the
CD4+ T Lymphocyte Minimal Regulatory Network

logical functions associated with each node. When the values of a state vector S at t+1 are the
same as those at time t, the system has attained an attractor: S/C3(t)=S(t+n),n/C211.
An attractor is interpreted as a stable expression phenotype of a cell, representing a cell
type. All the states that lead to a solution S/C3constitute the basin of attraction of such an at-
tractor. We determined the attractors and basins of attraction of the network using the R li-
brary BoolNet. Attractors were classified depending on the expression of both the master
transcription factors and the main cytokine. Th0 was defined as expressing no transcriptionfactors or regulatory cytokines. Th1 was defined as Tbet and IFN- γactive [ 8], Th2 as GATA3
and IL-4 active [ 8] and GATA3+ (a Th2-like cell type) as GATA3+IL4-[ 38]. Th17 was identi-
fied by ROR γt and STAT3 signaling mediated by IL-6 or IL-21, all of which require the pres-
ence of TGF- βe[9–10]. The iTreg type was defined by Foxp3 and TGF- β, IL-10 or both, all of
which require the presence of IL-2e [ 16]. Tfh cells were defined by Bcl6 and STAT3 signaling
mediated by IL-21 [ 12]. Th9 cells express IL-9, requiring the presence of TGF- βand extrinsic
IL-4 [ 27]. T regulatory Foxp3-independent CD4+ T cells (TrFoxp3-) featured TGF- β, IL-10 or
both, without expressing Foxp3 [ 52]. Th1 regulatory cells (Th1R) express a regulatory cytokine
and T-bet [ 46]. Th2 regulatory cells (Th2rR) express a regulatory cytokine and GATA3 [ 47].
Network validation. The network was validated by comparing it with reported knock-out
and over-expression profiles. To simulate loss of function mutations (knock-out) and inhibi-
tions of the signaling pathway, we set the value of the corresponding node to 0 throughout the
complete simulation. To simulate over-expression, the value of the node was set to 1.
The functional robustness of the network was characterized by altering the logical functions
of the network. Functional robustness refers to the invariance of the attractors in response to
noise or perturbations [ 44]. In this case, to verify that the results of the model did not depend
on over-fitting the logical functions, we perturbed the latter and verified the stability of the re-
sulting attractors and their basins. To achieve this, we randomly selected a large number of en-
tries and flipped their values from 0 to 1 or vice versa, one by one (bit flip). The basins andattractors were obtained for the altered networks and compared the original basinsand attractors.
To further evaluate the robustness of the network to small changes in the values of the
nodes and interaction functions, we approximated the Boolean step functions as continuousfunctions [ 44]. We replaced the logical functions f(x
i) with a set of continuous functions that
satisfy Zadeh's rules of fuzzy propositional calculus. Using this approach for each state variable,
we derived a continuous function, w i(q). The latter functions correspond to step-like (differen-
tiable) activation functions. The continuous system can then be described by:
dqi
dt¼1
e½−2bðwiðqÞ−wthr
iÞ/C138þ118
where w iis the input function for node i, w ithris a threshold level, b is the input saturation rate,
andαiis its relaxation rate. In particular, for b >>1, the activation function becomes a Heavi-
side step function.
Plasticity
The attractors of the network correspond to cell types. A multi-stable system can have multipleattractors and switch between them in response to alterations in the state of the system [ 65].
To study the plasticity and robustness of the system we transiently perturbed the attractors ofthe network and then evaluated the functions until we arrived at an attractor. This methodolo-
gy enabled us to obtain all the transitions between cell types, the specific perturbations that
caused those transitions, and the path from one cell-type to another. We define an attractor as

The complexity of biochemical intracellular signal transduction net-
works has led to speculation that the high degree of interconnectivitythat exists in these networks transforms them into an informationprocessing network. To test this hypothesis directly, a large scalemodel was created with the logical mechanism of each node de-scribed completely to allow simulation and dynamical analysis. Ex-posing the network to tens of thousands of random combinations ofinputs and analyzing the combined dynamics of multiple outputsrevealed a robust system capable of clustering widely varying inputcombinations into equivalence classes of biologically relevant cellularresponses. This capability was nontrivial in that the network per-formed sharp, nonfuzzy classiﬁcations even in the face of addednoise, a hallmark of real-world decision-making.
information processing /H20841systems biology
Intracellular signal transduction is the process by which chemical
signals from outside the cell are passed through the cytoplasm to
cellular systems, such as the nucleus or cytoskeleton, where appro-priate responses to those signals are generated. Unlike classicalbiochemical pathways (such as those involved in various metabolicactivities) that are generally well understood and characterized bya degree of understandability and efficiency that can be described
as elegant, signal transduction pathways are noted for their non-linear, highly interconnected nature. Stimulation of a given cellsurface receptor can induce the activation of a network of tens oreven hundreds of cytoplasmic proteins; these networks are notnecessarily receptor-specific because different receptors, even thoseassociated with highly differing cellular functions, often activatecommon sets of proteins (1–3). How differential responses aregenerated by these networks is not obvious nor is the reason cellsevolved such a complicated mechanism for transducing signals.Thus, a full understanding of the mechanism of intracellular signaltransduction remains a major challenge in cellular biology.
Similarities in the structure of signal transduction networks to
parallel distributed processing networks have led to speculation thatsignal transduction may involve more than simple passing along ofsignals. One hypothesis is that signal transduction pathways func-tion as an information-processing system that confers nontrivialdecision-making ability (4–8). The number and variety of surfacereceptors indicates that cells, either as single cells or as part ofmulticellular organisms, likely encounter a large amount of infor-mation from their environments. Thus, surface receptors functionas cellular sensory systems that bring in information that must becentralized and integrated and the proper cellular response de-cided. Decision-making in real-world cellular environments (whichare often chaotic, noisy, or contradictory) is unlikely to be relativelytrivial (e.g., linear feedback) but, rather, a higher-order, nontrivialdecision-making function analogous to neural networks. The abilityof individual cells to process information and make nontrivialdecisions would have an obvious advantage in terms of adaptationbut might also characterize a fundamental difference between livingand nonliving systems (9, 10).
Testing the hypothesis of signal transduction networks as non-
trivial decision-making systems requires a systems biology approachbecause it is likely that the decision-making function is an emergent
property of the entire system working in concert (11–13). Numer-ous studies have been performed on the static connectivity maps ofsignal transduction networks to compare them to other naturallyoccurring large-scale networks (14). The next major step to extendthese results (and a crucial requirement to test explicitly foremergent functions multifamily signal transduction networks) is tostudy the actual dynamics of a large-scale system (15). To simulateand observe the dynamics of a system, each node’s logic (or‘‘instruction set’’) for activation must be determined based on theactivation states of all of its regulatory inputs; i.e., the complete logicof each node in the system must be taken into account. In this study,we have created a large-scale model of signal transduction consist-ing of three major receptor families; receptor tyrosine kinases(RTKs), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), and Integrins.Using logical instruction sets for each node derived from mecha-nistic data in the biochemical literature, we show that this signaltransduction network is able to perform nontrivial pattern recog-nition, a high-level activity associated with decision-making inmachine learning. Nontrivial pattern recognition involves decision-making based on input information that is not necessarily clean orclear-cut; i.e., decision-making in real-world environments. In ad-dition to the ability to classify clearly even relatively indistinctinputs, we show this pattern recognition function is robust in thatit is able to perform even under high noise conditions. Together,
these results are strong evidence that intracellular signal transduc-tion networks have emergent functions that are characteristic of anontrivial decision-making system.
Results and Discussion
Because of the highly organized nature of the cytoplasm, the size
and shape of the kinetic curves representing the in vitro interaction
of two signal transduction elements may not represent the trueinteraction of those elements in the cell. Because of this, continu-ous, differential equation-based models are difficult to parameter-ize realistically. This is an important limitation because the dynam-ics of a continuous model depend highly on the parameter valuesused. In cases where the function of the system being modeled isknown, it is sometimes possible to reverse-engineer the parametersnecessary for a continuous model (16–18). In the present study, theemergent functions of the network are only hypothesized, thereforemaking the reverse-engineering of parameters impossible.
To avoid the problem of parameterizing a quantitative model, a
discrete Boolean model of signal transduction was created (19, 20).
